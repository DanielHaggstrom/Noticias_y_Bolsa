0;V;Visa Inc;2020-03-02T22:18:28Z;Visa cuts outlook for revenue growth owing to coronavirus impact;Update comes less than a week after rival Mastercard also cut its outlook;Visa has followed its competitor Mastercard and cut its outlook for revenue growth in the current quarter, citing the impact of the coronavirus on cross-border payments.“The most significant impact [of the virus] has been on travel to and from Asia. This has resulted in a sharp slowdown of our cross-border business, in particular travel related spending” the company said in a regulatory filing. Visa lowered its revenue expectations for its second fiscal quarter, ending March 30, by 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points from the “low double digits” level it projected at the end of January. It noted that the situations remains “fluid.”“Cross-border growth rates have deteriorated week by week since the coronavirus outbreak in China . . . we anticipate that this deteriorating trend has not bottomed out yet,” the company said. A week ago, Mastercard cut its outlook for the quarter, which had also called for low teens growth, by 2 to 3 percentage points, also citing cross-border travel and ecommerce. Visa’s revenue grew by 10 per cent in the December quarter.Visa shares rose by 6 per cent on Monday, ahead of the announcement, as the market rallied back from sharp declines last week. The shares remain 10 per cent below their February peak. Subscribers can use myFT to follow the latest ‘coronavirus’ coverage
1;V;Visa Inc;2020-01-14T05:33:33Z;Visa/Plaid: check mark ;If the data sharing era cannot be avoided then it makes sense for banks to prefer working with a known entity;US banks have given the nod to Visa’s $5.3bn bet on open banking through Plaid, the San Francisco fintech that connects bank accounts to apps.At first glance this looks foolhardy. Plaid is a data aggregator that shares customer information with online companies such as PayPal’s Venmo so that users can make payments and keep an eye on their spending without ever going to the bank. Retail banks should see this as a threat. The easier it is for customers to access financial services through third-party apps the less they interact with the bank that holds their current account. Banks lose their chance to up-sell services. One day customers might decide they do not need a bank account at all.Visa, however, built its business on symbiosis rather than disruption. If the era of data sharing cannot be avoided then it makes sense for banks to prefer working with a known entity.The deal could therefore help some of the problems Plaid has experienced as it has expanded to work with more than 11,000 financial institutions. In theory, banking data in the US belongs to the individual. But banks sometimes prevent access to outside companies, citing the need to ward off potential damaging breaches. A recent security update at PNC Bank prevented Plaid from accessing information. With Visa’s backing such concerns may ease.For Visa this is an expensive deal. At $5.3bn Visa is paying twice Plaid’s last private valuation. Most of the acquisition will be purchased with a mixture of cash and debt. Another $400m will be in stock. It may not leave much of a dent in the $420bn company’s $14bn cash pile but the immediate benefits look fairly modest. Plaid makes most of its money from licence fees. Visa expects the deal to add up to 100 basis points to revenue growth in 2021, suggesting about $250m. This means Visa is paying 21 times Plaid’s expected sales.Look to the horizon, however, and the deal is worth the price. Plaid’s data will give Visa insights into most of the major financial technology companies. That could direct the company’s future acquisitions and product sales. Visa has just bought a key piece of the infrastructure required for a digitised financial system.
2;V;Visa Inc;2020-01-13T22:15:46Z;Visa to buy fintech Plaid in $5.3bn deal;Payments company deepens ties to Silicon Valley with latest tie-up;Visa agreed to acquire Plaid, a group that connects fintech companies with their customers’ bank accounts, for $5.3bn in the latest large tech-focused deal by the payments company.The acquisition of the Silicon Valley company, which is backed by high profile tech investors including Mary Meeker and Andreessen Horowitz as well as Goldman Sachs, comes less than two years after it was valued at $2.65bn. For Visa the transaction indicates its latest effort to make a further push into the fast growing fintech sector. In 2017 it acquired a minority stake in Sweden’s payments provider Klarna, which became Europe’s most valuable fintech company in the summer.Plaid provides so-called “aggregator” software that allows fintechs and other financial services companies to access client’s bank account information. Its clients include the financial planning apps Mint and Acorns and the money transfer app Venmo. “This acquisition is the natural evolution of Visa's 60-year journey from safely and securely connecting buyers and sellers to connecting consumers with digital financial services,” said Al Kelly, chief executive and chairman of Visa. “The combination of Visa and Plaid will put us at the epicentre of the fintech world, expanding our total addressable market and accelerating our long-term revenue growth trajectory.” A year ago, Plaid bought rival aggregator Quovo for around $200m. Other aggregators include California’s Yodlee, which was bought by Envestnet for $660m in 2015, and Utah-based Finicity. The aggregators have long had uneven relationships with banks, which have expressed reservations about the aggregators’ ability to protect customers’ personal information. Of particular concern is “screen scraping,” where consumers provide their bank login details to third-party fintechs, rather than using secure APIs (application programming interfaces) that can transmit data from the bank without the release of passwords. JPMorgan Chase recently said it would ban fintechs from using its customers’ passwords to access their accounts. API connections require banks to come to explicit agreements with aggregators and fintechs, which screen-scraping does not. Visa’s move to take over Plaid could help strengthen relations with larger banks. In the press release announcing the deal on Monday, JPMorgan’s head of consumer banking endorsed the deal as “an important development in giving consumers more security and control over how their financial data is used.” “Protecting customer data and helping them share that information safely has long been a top priority for Chase. We look forward to partnering with Visa to continue building a great experience for our shared customers,” said Gordon Smith, co-president, JPMorgan Chase and chief executive of consumer and community banking.Goldman Sachs served as the sole adviser to Plaid. Lazard acted as Visa’s sole adviser.
3;V;Visa Inc;2019-12-11T09:21:20Z;Visa in partnership with MFS Africa digital payments hub;Tie-up aims to allow people with mobile wallets to pay for international online services;Visa will enter a partnership with MFS Africa, a pan-African mobile money hub, with a view to linking Africa’s mobile money ecosystem with global digital payments and tapping into the $50bn African remittance market.The partnership is intended to enable people with mobile wallets in Africa to pay for international online services that are currently unavailable to most African users as well as to receive money sent from abroad. MFS Africa says it is Africa’s largest cross-border digital payments hub, connecting more than 180m mobile wallets accessed through phones in 30 countries.Under the Visa partnership, mobile money users on the MFS Africa platform will be able to generate a 16-digit virtual card to use for remittances and online transactions, the companies said.Dare Okoudjou, founder and chief executive of MFS Africa, said his company already handled tens of thousands of intra-African cross-border transactions between different phone networks, something that will become more important as the 54-nation African Continental Free Trade Area begins to come into effect from next year.Partnering with Visa, he said, would enable users to extend their transactions outside Africa. “Now you can receive money from the US and make a payment in France,” he said.“Any kid with a mobile wallet in Kigali should now have enough to deal with the rest of the world,” he said, referring to the Rwandan capital.In the future, MFS Africa would explore the possibility of extending the service to Chinese digital money transaction services, such as Alipay, he said.Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product officer, said: “Africa is adopting a mobile-led, digital payments ecosystem and with Visa looking to accelerate the distribution of payment credentials and expand the acceptance space for digital payments, this partnership is an important one.”There is increasing interest from fintech providers in building on Africa’s digital money network, which was pioneered a decade ago in east Africa but is still fragmented and patchy.Some countries, including Nigeria, have been more cautious about allowing telecoms companies to move into banking. Advocates say this is excluding tens of millions of potential customers who cannot afford to open a bank account from accessing financial services. It is also making life harder for ecommerce companies such as Jumia, which listed in New York this year, but has since retrenched from some African markets.Visa has shown an appetite for investing in Africa. In November, it took a stake, reported as 20 per cent for $200m, in Nigerian fintech Interswitch, valuing the company at $1bn.Mr Okoudjou said the Visa partnership should help lower the cost of remittances into Africa, which are currently the most expensive in the world with providers taking a nearly 10 per cent cut in transaction fees. “Our mission is to bring down the cost of remittances into and within Africa,” he said.
4;V;Visa Inc;2019-06-03T03:00:27Z;China’s UnionPay joins Europe credit card battle;Mastercard and Visa face new rival after link-up with UK payment start-up Tribe;China UnionPay, the world’s biggest card issuer, is to start offering debit and credit cards in Europe for the first time as the Chinese state-controlled giant continues its global expansion to challenge Visa and Mastercard.UnionPay, which has issued more than 6bn cards in China, has partnered with Tribe Payments, a new UK-based back-office technology start-up, to allow banks and fintechs to start offering individuals and companies its branded cards from this month.“This agreement shows UnionPay’s intent to compete with the major card schemes in Europe,” said Suresh Vaghjiani, the founder of Tribe. “This is the first time European institutions will be able to put UnionPay cards into the hands of people on the street.”Mr Vaghjiani says Tribe so far has two clients interested in UnionPay’s services, one for a virtual card in Europe and another for a debit card in the UK. He declined to name them.“European corporate clients that do business in China will now be able to use UnionPay cards there, while Chinese businesses in Europe will have a consistent payment method at home and abroad,” Mr Vaghjiani added.Founded in 2002 under a charter from the People’s Bank of China, UnionPay has a virtual monopoly on domestic bank card payments, where it has issued more cards than Visa and Mastercard combined.The Chinese group has been expanding internationally in recent years, mainly in Asia, and says its cards are accepted by more than 41m merchants and 2m ATMs in 170 countries, 40 of which are in Europe.“We have the largest cardholder base in the world, working with issuers through Tribe is important to our growth,” said Zhihong Wei, head of UnionPay in Europe.It first moved into the continent a decade ago to provide access for Chinese tourists and its cards are now accepted by 60 per cent of merchants and ATMs in the region.Seven years ago London department store Harrods installed a UnionPay point-of-sale terminal, prompting a surge in sales from Chinese students and tourists who were able to spend directly from their home bank accounts.UnionPay’s new move comes amid intensifying competition in its home market from digital payments groups such as Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay. The two have dislodged UnionPay from its dominant position online, robbing it of fee income and valuable transaction data from consumers who have switched from traditional plastic to mobile phones.Mr Wei told the Financial Times in September the company did not need a licence for its European expansion plan as its cards will be issued by third parties, such as banks and fintechs, and its transactions will be handled by payment processing groups like Tribe.Tribe employs 72 people, has an office in London’s Shard and outposts in Lithuania and Denmark. Mr Vaghjiani previously ran another payments processor called Global Processing Services and has worked on systems for Monzo and Revolut.While UnionPay expands overseas, US rivals Visa and Mastercard have been repeatedly frustrated in their attempts to enter the huge Chinese market. Both have applied to Beijing for licences to clear renminbi payments, but the central bank has refused to acknowledge them. This is despite a World Trade Organization ruling six years ago that China discriminates against foreign payment groups.UnionPay operates a similar business model to Visa and Mastercard, earning a commission on each card swipe. The currency-printing unit of the People’s Bank of China is its largest shareholder, with most of the remaining equity held by other state-owned financial institutions.
5;V;Visa Inc;2019-05-28T16:06:47Z;Cryptocurrency Visa card could open a back door for dirty money;Regulators must stand firm on anti-money laundering requirements;In the battle against international money laundering, cryptocurrency remains the weakest link. Users can receive payments from unknown sources from around the world, which makes it hard for the network to keep out the proceeds of crime — ransom cyber attacks, drug trafficking, or worse. An extensive network of dealers also buy or sell crypto against cash.Until now, it has been relatively difficult to transform illegally earned crypto into real economy spending power. Few merchants accept cryptocurrency, so those sitting on illicit gains must exchange crypto into conventional, or fiat, currencies. That involves taking foreign exchange risks and then transferring the fiat money through wallet and exchange services into the core banking system. The end point is a bank account, which is significantly harder to obtain than a crypto wallet.As a result, criminally obtained cryptocurrency is still mostly contained in terms of real-world spending. Any big cash-out spree by the dark economy also bears the risk of crashing the entire crypto market, which puts many people off from taking money out.This is changing. One of the biggest gateways into the core financial system, the Visa network, is opening itself up to crypto-funded debit cards. Others have tried to launch such crypto cards before but failed for compliance reasons.Visa’s latest co-operation with Coinbase for a UK crypto card is different. The cryptocurrency exchange says the card will allow customers to “spend funds from your cryptocurrency wallets” anywhere Visa is accepted — basically everywhere. The card’s spending limit starts at a whopping £10,000 a month, rising to £20,000 for customers who meet certain criteria.This invites the question of how Coinbase was able to satisfy anti-money laundering and “know-your-customer” regulations. The regulatory environment around crypto has been evolving, and some wallet providers and exchanges now operate with official blessing under specially-devised compliance rules. But most still exist in regulatory vacuums, and criminals who are technically sophisticated can operate wallets without any oversight at all.In theory, that means anyone with a Coinbase account has the potential means to receive payments from an illegitimate source with little to no barrier. Visa says that it subjected this partnership to “enhanced” scrutiny and noted that Coinbase is regulated by US authorities. Although Coinbase often blocks accounts because of suspicious activity, I find it hard to believe that their system can eliminate risks entirely.Even if crypto exchanges and wallets comply with know-your-customer rules when someone applies for an account, crypto’s anonymous nature compromises their ability to monitor the legitimacy of transactions from then on. The only solutions I can see would be for them to routinely block payments derived from wallet addresses hosted by unregulated players or to individually scrutinise all unknown counterparties.This would incur huge costs and defy the ideological tenets of the crypto movement, which sought to create a parallel and anonymous value network outside of core banking. Even in the core banking system, the cost and risk of dealing with potentially non-compliant correspondent banks in countries with light-touch regulation has led institutions in places with stricter scrutiny to purge their banking relationships.If core banks cannot afford such relationships, how is it possible that crypto ones can? There are already sizeable fees associated with managing crypto exchange and liquidity risk — 2.49 per cent of each transaction in the Coinbase case. The whole thing risks turning into an uncompetitive luxury service.Either way, forcing crypto institutions to operate in a similar way to the core banking system is a must if the sector is to be allowed access to the core system via the Visa network. It’s the only way to maintain a level playing field and insure that 30 years of action against financial crime is not squandered.izabella.kaminska@ft.com
6;V;Visa Inc;2019-04-29T16:21:54Z;Visa and Mastercard to cut foreign card fees in EU;Latest concession in payment companies’ long-running antitrust battle with Brussels;Mastercard and Visa will cut the fees they charge on purchases made in the EU with foreign-issued debit and credit cards, a concession the payment companies hope will end their long-running antitrust battles with Brussels. Retailers will be charged an average of 40 per cent less on purchases made in the European Economic Area using Mastercard, Maestro, Visa, Visa Electron and V-PAY credit and debit cards issued in countries outside the EEA. At issue is the fee paid by a retailer’s bank to the cardholder’s bank — a so-called interchange fee — that the card companies use to cover costs of fraud, security and processing. According to Monday’s agreement, the fee on in-store purchases will fall to 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. Online purchases, where the card is not physically presented, will be charged a maximum of 1.15 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 1.50 per cent for credit cards. The higher fees reflect the greater risks, increased complexity and additional value of the global e-commerce payment service, as well as the wider range of competitors, which include PayPal and Alipay. Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, said the binding promises would “reduce the costs borne by retailers” and, along with earlier decisions, “lower prices for European retailers to do business, ultimately to the benefit of all consumers”. The newly agreed rates for foreign-issued card transactions will come into effect on October 19 and apply for five years. Visa and Mastercard can be fined up to 10 per cent of their global turnover if they fail to meet their commitments. Visa said it “played a central role negotiating a resolution that achieves the best outcome for all parties”. Mastercard said it saw “the closure of this antitrust chapter as an important milestone for the company”. EU officials launched their investigations more than a decade ago, initially focusing on fees charged on European-issued cards. Investigations into the two companies were separate and while Visa addressed the concerns through a series of settlements, Mastercard chose to fight the charges. The European Commission ruled in 2007 that Mastercard’s fees on cross-border purchases for European-issued cards broke the bloc’s competition rules and inflated the cost of card acceptance by retailers. It ordered the company to cut the fees.Mastercard capped fees on those purchases in 2009, at 0.2 per cent of transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. Visa soon followed suit and in 2015 the EU’s Interchange Fee Regulation made those caps legally binding. The EU’s 2007 decision provided the basis for a £14bn legal claim brought against Mastercard in the UK courts, filed on behalf of more than 46m British consumers — the first mass consumer claim brought under the new regime introduced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.In a decision in January, Ms Vestager fined Mastercard €570m for limiting the ability of retailers and banks to shop around between member states to find lower interchange fees.
7;V;Visa Inc;2019-04-24T21:40:09Z;Visa boosts earnings outlook for 2019 despite stronger dollar;;Visa lifted its earnings outlook for the year as continued growth in payments and transactions helped it fend off the effects of a stronger US dollar and post better than expected results for its second quarter.The San Francisco-based payments group said it now expected diluted earnings to increase by the “low twenties” in 2019 on a nominal dollar basis and including a 1.5 percentage point drag from foreign exchange effects. That is an improvement from three months ago when it forecast growth in the high teens that included just 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency impact.Visa also said it expected an effective tax rate of approximately 20 per cent, down from 20 per cent to 20.5 per cent previously, but kept steady its prediction for annual net revenue growth in the low double-digits.The company, which is the 12th-most valuable in the world with a market capitalisation of $324.5bn, said revenue in its second quarter ended March 31 were driven by a continued rise in the number of payments — up 8 per cent from a year ago — cross-border volume and processed transactions.For the second quarter ended March 31, Visa reported an 8 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to $5.49bn, squeaking ahead of the median forecast of $5.47bn in a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Net income of $2.98bn, up 14 per cent from a year ago, worked out to $1.31 a diluted share compared with expectations for $1.24 a share. Visa said exchange rate moves wiped about 1.5 percentage points from its earnings per share growth rate.Alfred Kelly, chief executive, said the company had “another solid quarter demonstrating the power of the business model”.In an effort to boost its cross-border network service, Visa recently beat out rival Mastercard in a £247m deal to buy Earthport, a UK-based company that specialises in cross-border payments for banks and other financial firms, allowing them to transfer money without having to manage their own relationships with local regulators and lenders. Britain’s competition regulator, though, said this month it was investigating whether the deal would reduce competition there.Visa shares were down 0.8 per cent in after-hours trade on Wednesday.
8;V;Visa Inc;2019-04-08T03:04:32Z;Fintech start-up Branch raises funding for EM lending push;New alliance with Visa helps loan provider pursue new markets;Branch International, a Silicon Valley-based start-up that offers loans to first-time borrowers and customers without bank accounts in Africa, India and Mexico, has raised $170m in new financing.The deal, which is made up of a combination of equity and debt, forms part of a new alliance with payments group Visa. “It’s tough to convince VCs in Silicon Valley to invest in something for Africa, and it’s tough to get lenders to lend due to the risk,” said Matthew Flannery, Branch founder.Branch is vying with its California-based rival Tala to become the first provider of financial services to the emerging middle class in developing markets, who are underserved by traditional banks. This latest round brings Branch’s total financing to $260m, comprised of $100m in equity and $160m in debt. The company started operating in Kenya in 2015, led by Mr Flannery, who had previously co-founded Kiva, the microfinance non-profit platform. After tracking [Branch] for four years, it has become clear to me that emerging markets are the big growth area for fintechBranch collects data from potential borrowers’ Android smartphones, including the contents of their text messages, address books and other apps they have installed, to assess their likely creditworthiness. Interest rates can range between annual rates of 12-180 per cent, with rates highest for first-time borrowers then falling as customers repay more loans. “To use a few buzzwords, we literally are using deep learning to do the underwriting,” Mr Flannery said, referring to one form of artificial intelligence that also analyses how borrowers use the Branch app and contact networks. “If people are careful using the app, if they look at the financial screens, the repayment plans, the terms and conditions, then they almost never default.”Branch expects to lend about $350m this year, usually in small loans of $20-$40, which are primarily financed by its own borrowings. The new venture round, which was led by Foundation Capital and Visa with participation from existing investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Formation 8, will be used to develop new markets after recently expanding from Africa into India and Mexico. “We want to set an example that this is a good market,” said Mr Flannery. “You can invest in low-income people in India.” Branch is expanding in the wake of infrastructure such as smartphone penetration, low-cost mobile payments systems like M-pesa, and government biometric databases. Its new partnership with Visa will offer “virtual” prepaid debit cards to 2m people that allow Branch customers to withdraw their loans using a cash machine, even if they do not have a bank account. “By focusing on digitising payments, we aim to build a more digitally inclusive ecosystem,” said Otto Williams, Visa’s vice-president of strategic partnerships, fintech and ventures. Charles Moldow, a general partner at Foundation Capital who is joining Branch’s board, said the company was “poised to become the cross-border financial super-app”. “After tracking [Branch] for four years, it has become clear to me that emerging markets are the big growth area for fintech,” said Mr Moldow. Mr Flannery said Branch was aiming to become a general-purpose bank, starting with small loans but expanding into savings accounts and then into remittances and payments. Despite moving into the for-profit world four years ago, he said that microfinance services such as Kiva are still needed to reach poorer people in more remote places. “What we are seeing is the commercial microfinance solutions are becoming bigger in the cities, while the non-profits are more relevant in more rural markets, which are not going to be profitable for years and years,” Mr Flannery said. “Banking today really serves the rich in emerging markets, especially in the developing world. Commercial microfinance serves the middle class and the working poor.”
9;V;Visa Inc;2019-03-08T18:27:32Z;BoE forces Visa to use PwC for independent review on outage;Credit-card group’s European arm must use auditor to assess incident that hit millions, says bank;The Bank of England took the rare step of announcing that it is forcing Visa Europe to implement recommendations of an independent review into its continent-wide outage in June that prevented millions of customers from making payments.The BoE said on Friday that it is using its statutory powers to force Visa to appoint accountancy firm PwC to assess whether the payments provider has properly implemented the recommendations of a report by EY, another firm, into the incident last year.While the central bank said it recognised Visa was already committed to taking up the findings, it said using its statutory powers was “action proportionate to the nature and impact of the incident”.Still, the BoE stressed that its action was not enforcement, which means an investigation and possible fine would ensue.Visa is headed in Europe by Charlotte Hogg, a former BoE deputy governor. More than 95 per cent of debit cards in the UK ran on Visa’s network at the time.The company said it had “implemented significant enhancements to our network” since the service disruption “to ensure resilience of our systems and better co-ordination with our clients on behalf of consumers”.It had previously acknowledged several failures in its response to the outage. The independent review by EY found that, while Visa Europe’s infrastructure was well designed, the company was “insufficiently prepared” when a disruption did occur. It said communications with clients and customers were not effective, and there was a “number of weaknesses” in its processes for manually responding to problems.The outage was just one high-profile incident last year that sparked an inquiry by the Treasury select committee into banks’ IT failures, and regulators’ responses to them.
10;V;Visa Inc;2019-02-19T12:15:39Z;China’s slow reforms stack odds against multinationals;Trade talks can improve US access but local champions hold unassailable positions;It is hard to imagine now but when China acceded to the World Trade Organization more than 17 years ago, China UnionPay did not exist. The state-owned card payments monopoly was created in March 2002, three months after the WTO formally welcomed the country as a member.Almost two decades later, Visa and Mastercard’s wait to pass through the gates to enter the world’s largest card payments market seems set to end. It is inconceivable that US president Donald Trump would sign off on a trade deal with Beijing that did not finally resolve the impasse.But when the US card companies finally do enter China, they will confront a radically different market from the one that beckoned in December 2001. And unfortunately for many other multinationals, their frustrating China experience is not an unusual one. In industry after industry, foreign companies have been allowed in only after local champions have secured unassailable positions — or after new technologies and competitors have totally changed the market landscape.China’s moves over the past year to liberalise its financial sector, by raising or eliminating foreign-investment caps for insurance companies and brokerages, is a classic example. Ten or 15 years ago, such market access reforms could have given overseas finance companies a real opportunity to establish themselves in China. Instead, the delay gave their domestic competitors time to consolidate dominant market positions.As one senior western finance executive told the Financial Times: “I must be really bad at my job because I’ve been coming to China for almost 30 years and if our operations here disappeared tomorrow, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference to our global business.”Visa and Mastercard were doubly cursed. Had they been allowed to enter the Chinese market in 2002 — as the WTO later ruled they should have been — they might have been able to give UnionPay a run for its money in the race to provide China’s emerging middle class with branded debit and credit cards.Instead the Chinese government protected UnionPay’s monopoly. It was not until 2010 that the Obama administration finally challenged Beijing’s discriminatory treatment of foreign electronic payment providers, with a WTO ruling in Washington’s favour coming two years later.China ignored the WTO ruling and seven years later, Visa and Mastercard are still locked out. And when they are finally let in, UnionPay will be the least of their problems.Since 2012 Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay “e-wallets” have become ubiquitous. It is not just millennials who pay for pretty much everything with a flick of their smartphones rather than using their UnionPay bank card, which involves a wait for the vendor to swipe it, entering a pin number and another wait for a printed receipt to sign. In China, using a card has become almost as quaint as writing a cheque.According to Worldpay, credit and debit cards accounted for less than 15 per cent of all online payments in China in 2017 compared with a 62 per cent market share for e-wallets such as Alipay or WeChat Pay.Even bank transfers, now done easily via smartphones, are set to overtake credit cards as China’s second most popular payment option by 2021, when the country’s e-commerce market will be worth an estimated $1.6tn.For foreign investors, the same dynamics are at work in the Chinese market for electric and other “new energy” vehicles. As part of the China-US trade talks, Beijing has highlighted its plans to eliminate government subsidies for domestic NEVs while also finally allowing foreign carmakers to wholly own China-based manufacturing operations.“Having used mercantilist tactics to build local champions, China is tapering off some subsidies and restrictions,” Nigel Cory and David Hart at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said in a recent note. “Building these local champions at the early stage of technological development and adoption means China will be well placed to capitalise on other countries’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions and spur NEV adoption.”Chances are that many other Chinese market access concessions offered up in the trade talks will be similar exercises in letting US companies into the stable only after all the horses have bolted. Mr Trump should think twice about hailing such offers as “big progress”, as he is wont to do, when it comes time to accept or reject a final trade deal.tom.mitchell@ft.com
11;V;Visa Inc;2019-02-08T07:45:37Z;Visa ups offer for UK payments group, fending off Mastercard bid;US-based card network offers £247m for Earthport;A bidding war for British payments group Earthport is hotting up, with Visa upping its offer after an earlier attempt to buy it was gatecrashed by its largest rival, Mastercard.Visa said on Friday it made an offer of 37p per share — or £247m in total — for Earthport, 12 per cent higher than the price agreed with Mastercard two weeks ago and 23 per cent more than the original deal it offered Earthport late last year.Shares in Earthport jumped almost 9 per cent to 42p after the news.The stock has been trading higher than Mastercard’s offer price since its bid was announced, suggesting many shareholders were expecting a counter-offer.Earthport’s board recommended the latest offer, and Visa said it had already received commitment to support the offer from shareholders controlling around 17 per cent of Earthport shares.Mastercard said it was “considering its options and urges Earthport shareholders to take no action” in response to Visa’s announcement.The Aim-listed company specialises in cross-border payments for banks and other financial firms, allowing them to transfer money without having to manage their own relationships with local regulators and lenders.Visa said that “Earthport can complement the development of Visa’s payment solutions and intends to use its resources to help Earthport grow”. The US group said it may consolidate some of Earthport’s existing offices and data centres into Visa’s own network, but “does not expect to make a material change in the balance of skills and functions of the employees and management of Earthport”.
12;V;Visa Inc;2019-02-01T16:51:05Z;Fintech firm Curve threatens Amex with legal action;American Express blocks customers from using the all-in-one payment card;Curve, the all-in-one payment service, has threatened legal action against American Express after the card provider blocked thousands of customers from using the fintech firm’s services this week.Founded in 2015, Curve enables users to load all of their debit and credit cards on to one card and choose which one to spend via its smartphone app, removing the need to carry multiple cards.Curve announced on Monday that UK Amex holders could add their cards to the app and spend through Curve, joining Visa and Mastercard. However, on Tuesday, Amex blocked its cardholders from using the service. Curve said that Amex users spent more than £450,000 before the service was blocked.In a blog post on Curve’s website, Shachar Bialick, founder and chief executive, described the move as a “bombshell” which had been “entirely disproportionate and discriminatory to Curve and our joint customers”.“Amex has given no good or fair reason for their decision,” he said. “We have already sent a letter [asking Amex] to reconsider their decision and have given them reasonable time to comply. Failure to do so will mean that we will be forced to exercise our rights in the courts and to submit complaints to the relevant regulators in the UK and Europe,” he added.Through its membership points system, Amex cards offer a range of rewards such as cashback, Avios points to spend on British Airways flights and exclusive deals with brands such as Hilton and Selfridges.Curve customers have taken to social media to express their dissatisfaction at being unable to spend on Amex and collect points and cashback.Curve user Matt Elliot tweeted: “I spend more on Amex through Curve, due to many places not accepting it natively.”Jonathan Conway, another user, tweeted: “It’s already hard enough finding places that accept Amex as it is. Got a Curve card because I thought it’d improve the situation.”In a statement, American Express said it had participated in a limited trial where a small number of customers could load money on to an e-wallet using their Amex card in the Curve app.“We informed Curve that we would not participate in the further roll out of the Curve e-wallet, prior to them launching the product,” Amex said. “We do not have regulatory obligations to work with a particular partner and we can confirm that we have terminated our agreement with Curve.”Curve is a free service, although premium users can pay £150 upfront for a metal Curve card which offers fee-free foreign transactions, worldwide travel insurance, gadget insurance and the ability to “go back in time” and move purchases between cards.Curve customers have received an email explaining their legal entitlement to a 14-day “cooling-off” period, within which they can cancel the service and get their money back. In addition to this, Curve said it was giving its customers 14 extra days to decide whether they want to keep their cards.

Sunil Sabharwal, Earthport’s interim chairman, said the offer “provides our shareholders with even greater value”.Shares in Earthport, which is listed on London’s secondary Aim market, jumped 28 per cent to 35.6p. The rise above Mastercard’s offer price suggests some investors expect further counter-offers.Visa said it was “considering its options” and would provide an update “in due course”.There has been a wave of merger and acquisition activity in the payments industry as customers have turned to cashless payments and infrastructure technology has improved.Most recently, US payments processor Fiserv said it would buy rival First Data for $39bn, in what would be one of the largest financial services takeovers since the crisis.Meanwhile, several groups are considering initial public offerings this year, including Italy’s Nexi and UAE-based Network International.Earthport allows banks and other financial firms to move money across borders without having to establish relationships with local regulators and banks in each country. One Earthport shareholder suggested Visa and Mastercard, which have been looking to diversify away from their traditional cards businesses, would be attracted by Earthport’s existing network and local expertise.“I don’t think its inconceivable that a third party would show up” with its own bid, they added.Despite high-profile clients such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Japan Post Bank, and backers including the World Bank, Earthport has struggled to win over investors since it floated on Aim in 2009.The Earthport shareholder said they thought the company had been undervalued because of stock market investors’ focus on short-term profits and lack of understanding of the industry.In its most recent financial year, the company lost one of its biggest customers, and its shares dropped 26 per cent in the 12 months running up to Visa’s offer. It changed its executive team, installing a new chief executive and chief financial officer, and said in its full-year results last month that it was aiming to become a “bigger and more technologically enabled player in the global payments market”.Investors holding a total of 13 per cent of Earthport’s shares have sent letters supporting the proposed Mastercard deal.
14;V;Visa Inc;2019-01-13T22:00:24Z;China’s central bank delays market entry for Visa and Mastercard;New rules allow foreign access, but PBoC has refused to process card companies’ applications;China’s central bank has refused to acknowledge applications submitted by Visa and Mastercard to process renminbi payments, despite rules in 2017 that removed formal obstacles to foreign participation in the $124bn market following a decade-long struggle. The application delays highlight complaints by overseas companies and White House trade negotiators that China uses informal barriers to block foreign competition in the domestic market, even where written rules ostensibly guarantee fair treatment. Although Visa and Mastercard submitted applications to the People’s Bank of China more than a year ago, the PBoC has not formally acknowledged these submissions, according to two people familiar with the application process.China’s refusal to process the applications could cause trouble in trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing, which are reaching a critical juncture ahead of a March 2 deadline to strike a deal or face a new escalation in tariffs.The US has been trying to secure greater market access for American financial services companies, along with other changes to Chinese economic policy, like curbing the forced transfer of technology. The Office of the US Trade Representative, which is leading the talks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.In a typical Chinese permissions process, formal acceptance and acknowledgment — shouli in Chinese — is the initial step towards approval. According to the application procedure published in 2017, the central bank must decide on applications within 90 days of acknowledgment. “It’s a funny spin on World Trade Organization compliance. Yes, China will have due process for the application once they’ve accepted it, but no one ever thought it would be possible not to accept the application,” said one of the people. In November, American Express became the first foreign card scheme to win initial approval from the central bank to establish a renminbi bank-card clearing company. But Amex’s approval raised eyebrows because the new entity is a 50-50 joint venture with a Chinese partner, even though the rules permit wholly foreign-owned ventures. Reuters reported in November 2017 that China was pressuring Visa and Mastercard to operate through joint ventures.But an executive at a major foreign card operator said the PBoC had not explained its refusal to process the company’s application. “One could suspect that it’s because of the trade war, but then again American Express was approved. Somebody said, ‘Well Amex is smaller, so there’s less impact to the market,’ but nobody really knows,” he said. “There are a lot of variables. We are communicating with the central bank on and off, but there’s no clear reason.” Visa, Mastercard and the PBoC did not answer requests for comment.Visa and Mastercard’s efforts to enter China date back at least a decade. The WTO ruled in 2012 that China discriminates against foreign payment providers, nearly two years after the US government filed the complaint. In October 2014, China’s cabinet declared that it would open the market to foreign players. The cabinet published a more specific market entry framework six months later, and the PBoC followed up with rules governing bank-card clearing companies in 2016.In June 2017, nearly five years after the WTO ruling, PBoC issued the application procedure for establishing such a business. Visa submitted its application in July 2017 and Mastercard followed suit later that year. The PBoC is the largest shareholder in China Unionpay, which maintains a de facto monopoly on renminbi bank-card payments in China. Visa, Mastercard and American Express have partnerships with Chinese commercial banks to issue foreign-branded credit cards, but they are only usable for foreign-currency payments. Chinese customers use such cards for international travel, but most domestic merchants do not accept them. Unionpay’s dominance in China helped it earn a 36 per cent market share globally in bank card payments, compared to 32 per cent for Visa and 20 per cent for Mastercard, according to RBR, a payments research group. Unionpay has sought to expand its international business in recent years, first in emerging markets and more recently in Europe. Chinese payment card transactions totalled Rmb848bn ($124bn) in the year to September 30 2018, up 11.5 per cent from a year earlier, according to PBoC data, despite the rapid rise of mobile payments, which has sparked a shift away from plastic.Additional reporting by James Politi in WashingtonFollow Gabriel Wildau on Twitter at @gabewildauThis article has been amended to reflect the fact that the renminbi-processing payments market is worth $124bn
15;V;Visa Inc;2019-01-07T05:00:25Z;At last, US banks are introducing contactless cards;Issuers which are first with long-delayed technology are set to reap benefits;To tourists from much of the rest of the English-speaking world — the UK, Canada, Australia — a visit to New York can feel like a trip into the past. They tap their credit cards against subway turnstiles or shops’ card readers and wait for something to happen. Nothing does.Contactless cards, taken for granted in many countries, will at last roll out at scale in the US in 2019, giving card-issuing banks a chance to grab market share away from cash and, potentially, one another.But the fact that tap and go payments have taken so long to hit the US shows the challenges to financial innovation in one of the world’s biggest markets.In 2017, according to the Federal Reserve, US consumers made $6.6tn in payments on credit, debit, and prepaid cards, 8 per cent more than the year before — and a little less than half of total consumer expenditures on goods and services. That proportion could be even higher, analysts think, if the US did not lack cutting-edge card payments networks.“Free enterprise is an inhibitor of progress in payments in the US, not the enabler — we get the privilege of living in chaos,” said Thad Peterson, consumer payments analyst at Aite, a research firm.In smaller markets, the shift to new payment standards is effectively mandated by common agreement between banks, with support from standard-setting bodies. The UK made the shift toward cards with chips “quickly, efficiently, and well” by 2006, Mr Peterson said, opening the way for contactless shortly thereafter. The US only just completed the move to chip cards.The age, size, and complexity of the US market has been a barrier. The US was where the card industry began, “and is arguably the most complex market in the world, with over 50 years of legacy systems”, said Craig Vosburg, president of Mastercard North America. There are thousands of banks — compared to a handful of major ones in other markets — tens of millions of merchants, and a fragmented industry that provide payments technology. This makes it hard to settle on ubiquitous solutions.The US industry muddled along with magnetic stripes and improvements to back-end technology. “Then Target happened” said Oliver Jenkyn, head of North America for Visa, referring to the retailer’s massive data breach in 2013, which included credit card numbers. “Everyone was saying ‘I shop at Target’. It was a major tipping point.” It pushed issuers to issue cards with chips, which are much harder to counterfeit.The crucial move to make chips ubiquitously acceptable in the US was a shift in liability rules at the card networks. After October 2015, merchants rather than banks became liable for fraudulent transactions using magnetic stripe cards, giving the merchants a strong incentive to update their card-reading equipment.Once terminals that accept cards with chips are in place, the move to contactless only requires updated cards. So the delay on chip cards put the US way behind on contactless. Visa says that outside the US, more than 40 per cent of face-to-face transactions with Visa cards already occur with a tap. The number is 90 per cent in Australia, 60 per cent in Canada, and nearly 50 per cent in the UK. In the US, the number is in the low single digits.When transit gets enabled through contactless, usage rates go up everywhere, not just in transit but in Starbucks, McDonald’s and so onMomentum appears to be building behind contactless in the US market, however. “Card issuers have changed their approach in the last six months — from sticking a toe in the water to a cannonball,” said Kevin Morrison, retail banking analyst at Aite. “They were thinking of doing it with one or two card types, premium ones, but now they are all in with credit and debit . . . The smaller banks said ‘if the larger institutions move, we have to go too.’”The key catalyst has been JPMorgan Chase, which announced in November that all of its credit and debit card holders would be moved to contactless by the end of 2019. No other major bank has made a similar commitment, but Mastercard says it has agreements with its bank partners that will bring contactless cards to customers accounting for two-thirds of its total payment volumes within two years. Visa expects 100 million contactless Visa cards to be issued in the US by the end of 2019.An important catalyst for adoption will be rapid transit. New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority says it will start accepting contactless payments in 2019, using the same technology provider that built the system in London’s Tube. Some 500 subway turnstiles and 600 buses will be upgraded in 2019. Pat Foye, president of the MTA, said the project is proceeding on time and on budget.“When transit gets enabled through contactless, usage rates go up everywhere, not just in transit but in Starbucks, McDonald’s and so on” said Mr Vosburg of Mastercard.The move comes to contactless at a crucial times for banks’ card businesses. While consumer credit quality remains strong, hot competition is pressuring fee revenue and stoking a rewards war.Being first to offer a consumer contactless will confer a key advantage on issuers. “What is at stake for the banks is top of wallet status for their cards,” said Mr Jenkyn of Visa. Contactless tends to be adopted for minor, everyday transactions — coffee and fast food — which puts consumers in the habit of reaching for their contactless card first.AT Kearney, a consultancy, has found that in developed markets the shift to contactless increases the number of transactions per card by 20-30 per cent.Whatever card gets pulled out first to set up an online account at, for example, Amazon or Apple ends up capturing all the spending, said Mr Peterson. “Top of wallet means much more now — the first card in your wallet is often the only card [you use].”
16;V;Visa Inc;2018-09-23T11:39:07Z;Legal settlement brings card issuers scant relief ;Main battle over rules imposed on merchants begins next year;As president of a family business – a chain of 34 gas stations and convenience stores in Northern California, under the Rotten Robbie brand – Tom Robinson negotiates with a lot of suppliers. “If I buy insurance, fuel, vehicles, I buy them from somebody,” and can shop around for a good deal, he says.Not so with the credit cards he accepts as payment from many of his customers.He likes taking plastic. His corner of retail is brutally competitive and anything that makes it easier for customers to pay is welcome. But he does not like that the fee he pays to the card issuing banks – “a large expense” – is non-negotiable. Rules from card networks Visa, MasterCard and American Express “put a barrier to dealing with the people that impact you”, he said, and do not give him the option of favouring certain cards. “I can’t say, ‘I’d give you a better deal if you use this or that card.’”Mr Robinson’s concerns received a measure of vindication last week, with the settlement of a long-running class action lawsuit against the card networks and a group of large banks. If the court approves the settlement, up to $6.2bn will be distributed to the plaintiffs – including, potentially, Mr Robinson.That sum may look large, but in the context of the amount spent on cards and the fees merchants pay, it is remarkably small. US consumers spent $3.4tn using credit cards in 2017, 50 per cent more than five years ago, according to the Nilson Report. That in turn generated $74bn in swipe or “interchange” fees, paid by merchants to the card issuing banks, implying that the average fee was over 2 per cent of transaction value. Visa and MasterCard, in turn, take a smaller transaction-based fee from the banks. (The case is somewhat different with American Express, which acts as its own bank.) If, as the plaintiffs to the lawsuits suggest, all these fees are kept artificially high by anti-competitive practices, a one-time payment of $6.2 billion is a tiny fraction of what is at stake.If interchange fees were driven down to levels seen in Europe and Australia – where they are capped under half a per cent by regulation– tens of billions in annual bank revenue would disappear, and Visa and MasterCard would in turn get less from the banks.And so, far from being ended by last’s week’s settlement, the crucial phase of the legal fight, over the legality of rules imposed on merchants by the card networks and the banks, begins in earnest next year. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that, by providing guidelines for the fees that banks charge merchants, the card networks have colluded to fix prices, and then entrenched those prices with unfair rules – such as the “honour all cards” rule, which requires merchants taking any of a networks’ cards to take all of them.In the case of American Express, which does not work with banks, merchants have argued that its stringent rules against merchants in its network “steering” customers towards other, lower-fee forms of payment have a similar anti-competitive effect.“There is no choice for retailers with respect to taking cards. It is like the old monopoly phone companies saying to customers, ‘Well, you can choose not to have a phone’ – it is a necessary part of business,’” said Douglas Kantor, council to the National Association of Convenience Stores, which is a party to the lawsuits.The card networks counter that the fee schedules are just a baseline, and that retailers can, and do, negotiate with banks over interchange fees. Visa and MasterCard both allow retailers to offer special discounts to users of certain banks’ cards. Only flatly refusing to take certain banks’ cards is forbidden, and removing that restriction would undermine the key benefits of a credit card network for both consumers and merchants – the fact that the cards work across the whole network. Crucially, they argue, a significant part of the interchange fee comes back to consumers, in the form of points and rewards. And those rewards have been growing – evidence that, for the banks if not the networks, the card business is becoming more competitive.But how much of the interchange fees collected ultimately goes back to cardholders is hard to measure. Plaintiffs lawyers argue it is just a fraction of the total.Interchange fees are falling, albeit very slowly. Changes are visible on the income statements of big card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup, where non-interest revenue from their credit card businesses has been falling, as higher rewards to cardholders, lower late fees, and tougher negotiations for rates on airlines and retailers’ own-branded credit cards make the business harder.The biggest winners from the current arrangements, perhaps, have been the card networks, which bring in lower fees per transaction, but take on no default risk. The shares of Visa, MasterCard and American Express have been among Wall Street’s great bull stories. American Express won a significant legal victory earlier this year. A group of retailers had alleged that rules forbidding merchants in the Amex network from “steering” customers to other forms of payment were anti-competitive. The US Supreme Court found, in a 5-4 ruling, that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated harm to cardholders. But the ruling was narrow, and the plaintiffs in the cases that remain open will try other approaches.Investors, after years of back and forth, may have tuned out the legal fight. But, as Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners said in a note to clients last week, the legal challenges “will maintain a heartbeat that could one day make the swipe fee debate audible again”.
17;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Visa and Mastercard offer $6.2bn for ‘swipe fees’ settlement;Potential agreement leaves conflict over rules imposed on merchants unresolved;Visa, Mastercard and a group of top-tier US banks have proposed a $6.2bn settlement of a long-running antitrust lawsuit over the card “swipe fees” they charge merchants.The monetary settlement requires court approval but, even if it is cleared, a related dispute over what rules the card networks can impose on merchants will remain unresolved.Under the deal, the two payment groups and banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, agree to pay $900m to the merchants on top of the $5.3bn agreed under a revised 2012 settlement. Visa’s share of the extra payout will be $600m, while Mastercard is liable for another $108m. Both companies had increased reserves to reflect their expected liabilities under the latest settlement.If the settlement is approved, plaintiffs will be given the option to opt out in light of the ongoing case on card network rules.“It is highly likely that the large merchants who are involved in litigation with the card networks will opt out of the settlement,” said Jeffrey Shinder, the lead lawyer for the so called “7-11” group of merchant plaintiffs, a group which includes Amazon, Starbucks, Lowe’s, and 7-11. “This case is fundamentally about structural issues, and not just money.”Of particular concern to many merchants is the “honour all cards rule” imposed on them by both Visa and Mastercard. It states that a merchant taking any bank issuer’s Visa card, for example, must take all Visa cards. Merchant groups claim that the rule removes the incentive for banks to charge lower transaction fees.In 2012, the card companies reached a $7.25bn agreement on the litigation, first brought 13 years ago, covering both the monetary and rules elements of the case. That was contested by some merchants, however, and ultimately rejected by the court, which found that the having the same lawyers representing plaintiffs suing both for monetary damages and “injunctive relief”, or changes to card network rules, represented a conflict of interest. The decision prompted the revised, monetary offer of $5.3bn.Regulators in other countries have imposed caps on the fees banks can charge credit hard holders. Under EU rules, the limit is 0.3 per cent for credit cards and in Australia the fees are capped at less than 1 per cent. In the US, “swipe fees” for debit cards were capped under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms but fees average about 2 per cent for credit cards.Brian Riley, a card industry analyst at Mercator Advisory Group, said there would be significant repercussions if swipe fees came down. “As you saw with debit cards in the US after Dodd-Frank, rewards programmes for cardholders will disappear quickly, and credit will probably tighten.”In mid-day trading in New York, Visa shares were up 1 per cent and Mastercard’s up 2 per cent, both ahead of the broader market.
18;V;Visa Inc;2018-09-16T13:41:09Z;China UnionPay kicks off European expansion with UK launch;World’s biggest payment card issuer challenges US rivals Visa and Mastercard;China UnionPay, the world’s biggest payment card issuer, is preparing to launch branded cards in the UK, the first step in a wider European expansion plan to challenge its US rivals Visa and Mastercard in one of their key markets.The move comes as UnionPay faces intense competition in its home market from digital payments groups Alipay and WeChat Pay. It is also likely to add to the frustration of its US rivals, which have spent years trying to enter the Chinese market.The Chinese state-controlled group will team up with a UK company as early as next month to start issuing virtual pre-paid cards for British corporate clients to give to their staff for use via a mobile wallet when travelling in Asia.This will be followed by more deals to issue UnionPay branded credit cards elsewhere in Europe as early as December. “In Europe we want to target local customers in the domestic market, not only people travelling to Asia” said Zhihong Wei, head of UnionPay in Europe.Founded under a charter from the People’s Bank of China in 2002, UnionPay has a virtual monopoly on bank card payments in its domestic market, where it has issued 6bn cards — more than Visa and Mastercard combined.The Chinese group has been expanding internationally in recent years, mostly in Asia, and its cards are accepted by more than 41m merchants and 2m ATMs in 170 countries.It first moved into Europe a decade ago to provide access for Chinese tourists and its cards are now accepted by 60 per cent of merchants and ATMs in the region. It has offices in Paris, London, Madrid, Milan, Frankfurt and Budapest, with another set to open in Stockholm.Mr Wei said it did not need a licence for its European expansion plan as its cards will be issued by third parties, such as banks, and its transactions will be handled by payment processing groups.Six years after the World Trade Organization ruled that China discriminates against foreign payment groups, Visa and Mastercard have applied to Beijing for licences to clear renminbi payments but are awaiting approval.UnionPay operates with a business model similar to Visa and Mastercard, earning a commission on each card swipe. The currency-printing unit of the PBoC is its largest shareholder, with the remaining equity mostly held by state-owned financial institutions.But the rise of mobile payments in China — dominated by Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay — has dislodged UnionPay from its dominant position in electronic payments. Beyond the loss of fee income, the group is also losing access to valuable transaction data from consumers who have switched from plastic to mobile phones.However, Mr Wei said UnionPay was regaining ground on its digital rivals with its QuickPass system, which uses Near Field Communication (NFC) chips of the type used at subway turnstiles around the world and contactless card payments in the US and UK.The move to issue UnionPay-branded cards in Europe comes seven years after London department store Harrods became one of the early UK retailers to install a UnionPay point-of-sale terminal, prompting a spike in sales from Chinese students and tourists who were able to spend directly from their Chinese bank accounts.
19;V;Visa Inc;2018-08-21T09:05:12Z;Is Kroger’s Visa ban a sign of things to come?;Monzo to join unicorn club, Amazon insurance ambitions, Netflixification of trading;"Visa is fond of boasting “wherever you are, there’s a Visa card to suit you”. But customers of US supermarket chain Kroger last week discovered there are limits to that claim.Kroger’s Foods Co. subsidiary has made good on its threat to stop accepting Visa credit cards, the culmination of a dispute over the interchange charges retailers pay to card networks for each transaction they process. The grocer has threatened to expand the ban to its other stores if they can’t reach an agreement soon.For most companies, a fight with America’s largest supermarket chain would be a worry. The ban knocked shares in Visa and its peers when it was announced late last month, amid worries that other frustrated companies could follow Kroger’s lead in trying to fight high processing charges. But the drops are barely blips in the context of the groups’ recent growth.Shares in Visa have risen almost 40 per cent over the past twelve months, while Mastercard has jumped more than 50 per cent. Even as challengers like Alipay, Apple Pay and PayPal encroach on their markets, investors have been drawn to the incumbent payment giants who they still believe will benefit from a structural shift away from cash and toward digital payments.But are investors overly optimistic about the prospects for legacy payments giants? As the Kroger conflict shows, Visa and Mastercard’s customers — both the merchants that take payments and the banks that issue cards — are agitating for lower costs.Regulators, meanwhile, are creating the conditions for challengers to flourish. The EU’s Second Payment Services Directive — PSD2 — makes it easier for third parties to initiate payments directly from customers’ bank accounts, bypassing the card companies’ networks.Mark Nelsen, Visa's senior vice-president and head of risk and authentication products, said change is nothing new. ”The way you pay has been changing fairly significantly already,” he told the FT. ”In my mind there’s been a constant drum of innovation happening and PSD2 is designed to accelerate that.”But while companies such as Sweden’s Trustly — which specialises in account to account payments that bypass the card networks — have built a foothold in a few markets, Mr Nelsen said established groups’ scale would make them hard to beat. Visa itself works with 46m merchants globally.“That connectivity is hard to replicate,” Mr Nelsen said, adding that Visa wasn’t taking the competition “lightly” and was doing “everything we can” to make sure Visa remains a top payments choice.Recent experience in China highlights the potential for customer habits to quickly change, with state-backed bank card network China UnionPay losing ground in its home market to mobile-driven services Alipay and WeChat Pay.Zilvinas Bareisis, an analyst specialising in consumer payments at Celent, the consultancy, said the new Chinese groups offered “a completely unique and really interesting consumer value proposition — they're not payments apps, it’s more like a lifestyle app with payments capability ingrained in that — that’s when you start shifting behaviours … that’s one thing we have been missing in the western world.”Still, he was sceptical that Visa and Mastercard’s dominance would end any time soon, given the groups’ investments in improving services and customers’ ingrained behaviours.Both companies have stepped up their investments in new tech and partnered with other fintech groups, with Mastercard’s £700m purchase of Vocalink marking one of the most visible responses to the potential changes in the market. Vocalink powers systems such as the UK’s Faster Payments scheme for consumer bank transfers, giving Mastercard a stake even in transactions that bypass its card network.If all else fails, Mr Bareisis added, the card networks’ healthy profit margins give them the option to drop prices to squeeze out competitors if they come under sustained pressure — the two companies both reported operating margins of over 50 per cent in the three months to June 30.That means that, in the long term, the complaints of companies like Kroger could fade — but for now Visa is still holding most of the cards.Unicorn Alert 
UK digital bank Monzo is set to join the unicorn club when it closes a $150m fundraising that values the firm at $1.5bn. The new valuation — which comfortably meets the unicorn definition of privately held start-ups worth at least $1bn — is more than four times the $356m Monzo was valued at when it last sold stock in November, according to an exclusive story in the FT. Nice work if you can get it. Amazon's Ambitions 
With its treasure trove of consumer spending and lifestyle data, and a captive audience of hundreds of millions, Amazon's forays into fintech are always worth watching. The tech giant'slatest wheeze, according to Reuters, is a UK insurance price comparison website. Amazon has already spoken to several insurers about the project, but talks are at an early stage. Netflixification of Trading 
Yes it's a real thing. Switzerland's UBS is developing a new algorithm that suggests future trades based on past ones, using similar underlying concepts to the ones that Netflix uses to encourage House of Cards watchers to peruse Designated Survivor. “A good sales person calls his or her client and goes over what they think will be interesting for the day,” said Giuseppe Nuti, who heads up data science in UBS’s FX, rates and credit Strategic Development Lab. “We are trying to automate that. It means the job of a sales person, which in many ways has remained immune to the technology revolution, will probably change.”Fintech views in the FT banking podcast German dream lives on Germany's retail banking market is notoriously difficult to crack, but investors have given open banking start-up Deposit Solutions  another $100m to do just that. The Hamburg-based bank has just completed the second-largest financing round of any German fintech, and is now valued at more than $500m. AI's jobs threats Few things make finance's Artificial Intelligence experts more uncomfortable than asking them about the potential for their creations to replace human bank tellers, box tickers, traders and assorted other personnel. Robots are about enhancing jobs, not ending them, the PR spin goes. The Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane blew a great big hole in that slogan on Monday, telling Radio 4 that AI could threaten more human jobs than the Industrial Revolution. Ebury heads south British international payments firm Ebury — which has built a $1bn valuation in nine years — is setting up shop in Sydney. Co-founder Juan Lobato told the Australian Financial Review that Sydney's status as a ”gateway country for the Asia Pacific” made it a key market in Ebury's expansion strategy. "
20;V;Visa Inc;2018-08-12T23:15:24Z;UK consumer spending wilts in the summer heat;Shoppers buy more groceries but pass on big-ticket items as budgets tighten;Warm weather and England’s successful stint in the World Cup failed to sustain a rise in consumer spending growth into July, according to figures from card company Visa and IHS Markit.Consumer spending was 0.9 per cent lower during July than the same month last year. The figures come from Visa’s payments data but are adjusted by the company IHS Markit to take into account inflation and factors such as more shoppers using cards instead of cash.Taken with figures published last week by the British Retail Consortium that found spending on items other than food fell during July, the data suggest a surge in retail sales that helped lift growth during the second quarter of the year failed to extend into the third quarter.The Visa figures indicated the heatwave had affected spending patterns, with spending on food and drink 3.5 per cent higher than a year earlier and spending in hotels and bars up 2.5 per cent.But Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa, said: “Retailers of household goods and those operating within recreation and culture noted significant declines, an indication that household budgets are stretched.”Spending on household goods, such as home appliances, fell 3.2 per cent compared with a year ago, while transport and communication expenditure was down 4.1 per cent.Weak consumer spending growth was one of the features of the economy last year, with households being forced to borrow, dip into savings or spend less in response to higher import prices putting pressure on consumers’ wallets.Real wages grew slightly during the first half of this year, but many economists believe rising incomes will not prompt a sustained rise in spending as budgets remain stretched and consumer confidence low.Mr Antipof said: “Retailers had a difficult time in early 2018, and while there was some respite in May and June, July’s fall in spending is concerning, particularly as we look ahead when the impact of the interest rate rise and back-to-school costs will probably put further pressure on Britons’ wallets.”The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously earlier this month to raise interest rates, as the central bank sought to damp spending growth. The MPC forecast rises in spending could fuel inflation because the productive capacity of the economy is not growing quickly.

Air Canada, TD, CIBC and Visa valued the offer at $3.64 per Aimia share. Aimia stock trading in Toronto climbed more than 30 per cent to $3.38, valuing the company at C$381m.The group backing the proposed deal said the transaction would safeguard the rewards points for millions of Canadians as Air Canada shifts to a new loyalty programme in 2020.“Given Aimia’s current situation and future prospects, the proposed transaction delivers value to Aimia’s stakeholders,” the consortium said in a statement.Aimia said in a statement its special committee would consider whether the proposal was in the best interests of shareholders and advised shareholders not to take any action with respect to the offer.

Jeffrey Campbell, chief financial officer, said the group was “now seeing the expected impact” of restrictions on “interchange” fees it can charge customers in the EU and Australia.David Togut, analyst at Evercore ISI, said: “Low interchange caps in the EU and Australia are making [the company’s] cards there uncompetitive relative to Visa and MasterCards, which offer a lower cost of acceptance to merchants.”Last month the US Supreme Court ruled in the company’s favour against retailers and other merchants, who have long complained about the costs and restrictions involved in accepting credit cards.The ruling was “a welcome end to a long legal battle”, said Stephen Squeri, chairman and chief executive.Regulators in other jurisdictions have not been so sympathetic to the group, however. In response to the restrictions in the EU and Australia, American Express said it was winding down third-party licensing agreements in both places, and was seeking to shift cardholders on to its own network instead.Mr Squeri, who replaced Ken Chenault at the helm this year, said: “We are a globally integrated payments company and the power of our differentiated business model was evident throughout the results.”The earnings report on Wednesday also underlined a recent shift in the business model of Amex, long known for its charge cards that customers need to pay back in full each month. The company is doing more lending, and total loans outstanding by the group rose from $67.9bn a year ago to $78.6bn.Provisions for loan losses rose 38 per cent from a year ago to $806m. Amex said the increase reflected expansion of the loan portfolio as well as higher write-off rates, adding the rise was “in line with” its expectations for the year.

The figures come from Visa’s payments data but are adjusted to take into account inflation and factors such as more shoppers using cards.Britain’s consumers were squeezed by higher prices last year and the fall in the pound prompted them to cut back on spending, but recent economic data have suggested that good weather and big events such as the World Cup and the royal wedding have helped to bring relief to the high street.“June’s encouraging data marks the first back-to-back monthly increase in consumer expenditure since spring 2017,” said Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa.“With the ‘hotels, restaurants and bars’ and ‘food and drink’ categories performing strongly in the month, there are clear signs that the British public has been getting into the World Cup spirit, while the good weather is also likely to have played its part.”Spending in hotels, restaurants and bars was 5.4 per cent higher than in June 2017, Visa reported, and spending on food and beverages was 2 per cent higher.Growth in spending on household goods was more muted, at 1.2 per cent, and spending on clothes and footwear increased by just 0.3 per cent.The data follow official monthly economic growth figures that found the retail and wholesale sector provided 0.1 percentage points of the 0.2 per cent growth in the three months to the end of May.However, economists have questioned whether the rebound in consumer spending will continue or if shoppers have just brought forward spending from later in the year and will have to cut back over July and August and in the autumn.Annabel Fiddes, principal economist at IHS Markit, which produces consumer spending data alongside Visa, said the temporary boost could change with the prospect of an increase in interest rates by the Bank of England and “anxieties” over the Brexit negotiations.“These key decisions will be crucial in determining the trajectory of the UK economy and consumer spending,” she said.
24;V;Visa Inc;2018-07-12T20:14:59Z;MasterCard customers suffer outages around the world;Problems arise just weeks after rival Visa hit technical problems;MasterCard has apologised after an outage at the credit card company blocked payments for customers using its cards around the world only weeks after its main rival Visa was hit by technical problems.It was not clear what caused the outage at MasterCard, which caused a surge in complaints to banks and other card issuers by frustrated customers unable to complete their payments. The credit card operator said on Thursday evening that the problem had been resolved.“We are aware that some issues were experienced and have been working hard to resolve it,” MasterCard said in an emailed statement. “The situation has been fully resolved and all transactions are now working as normal. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.”Regulators are already intensifying their scrutiny of apparent fragilities in the payments system after Visa suffered a serious outage in its European credit card network recently that left thousands of customers unable to complete transactions.Customers again took to social media to express their anger on Thursday. Sarah Louise Wilson in the UK tweeted: “Shame @Mastercard can’t communicate their current banking issues so that I can pay for my food shop! What a shambles!!!”Sharlene Sanders from the Netherlands tweeted: “On a business trip and just tried to pay hotel with @Mastercard . Didn’t work. Called @ING_news and the advice was, please pay with @Visa Ain’t that a peach? #fail.”The problems at MasterCard followed a broken switch at Visa that led to the failure of more than 5m attempted debit and credit card purchases during an outage across its European network.The Visa failure affected 2.4m transactions in the UK over a 10-hour period, forcing many stores to stop accepting card payments and prompting consumers in some areas to empty local ATMs.On Thursday MasterCard customers reported problems across much of Europe and America, but the US credit card company refused to provide an explanation for what caused it.Monzo, the UK digital bank, said in a tweet: “The Mastercard network had a partial outage starting at 6:05pm that caused some payments to decline. We are seeing card payments succeed as of 7:40pm and Mastercard have told us that the issue has been resolved.”TransferWise, the European digital payments company, said in a tweet that the problems at MasterCard were “affecting a large number of banks and that may cause some of your card payments to fail”.
25;V;Visa Inc;2018-07-04T10:28:12Z;Legal row between retailers and card processors faces fresh delay;Court of Appeal ruled case will need to be reconsidered by competition tribunal;A legal battle between UK retailers including Sainsbury and Asda and credit card companies over card fees will have to be reconsidered by a competition tribunal, the Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.Three senior judges had been asked to decide three appeals brought by retailers including Asda, J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison against Visa and Mastercard over the level of so-called interchange fees which are costs that businesses face for processing card payments levied each time a credit card is used as payment by customers.The retailers had argued that the level of interchange fees set within the Mastercard and Visa payment card systems was an unlawful restriction of competition law. The case is important because it will have a bearing on the outcome of other lawsuits brought against Mastercard and Visa by retailers over interchange fees.Sir Terence Etherton, Master of the Rolls, said on Wednesday the fees were unlawful and restrictive of competition but also said that previous decisions in the UK courts had incorrectly decided certain points of law on issues of exemption.The Court of Appeal said it was planning to remit the three cases for reconsideration by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) which examines competition cases.The CAT will not be able to re-try the cases or hear new evidence but will be able to assess damages and whether a claim for exemption should apply to the credit card companies. The CAT hearing will be chaired by a High Court judge and all three cases are expected to be heard together.The decision means further delay in finally determining the case which has dragged on for at least five years.The three cases all went to the Court of Appeal earlier this year after judges gave different rulings in lower courts.The Competition Appeal Tribunal in 2016 ruled that Mastercard must pay £68.5m in damages to Sainsbury’s after judges found it had broken EU and UK competition laws on interchange fees. Sainsbury’s had to pay the fees under Mastercard’s payment scheme but it later claimed damages for the level of interchange fees saying it had breached the Competition Act.However Visa won a separate case against Sainsbury’s in 2017 when the High Court found that its UK fees were lawful. Another High Court judge decided in 2017 that fees charged by Mastercard were not anti-competitive in a case brought by Argos, Morrison and Asda.Mastercard said in a statement that it was reviewing the court’s decision. It said:“ . . . we continue to firmly believe that retailers derive real value from our network and we are committed to helping our retail partners grow their businesses and encourage the adoption of ever more convenient, safe and secure payments.” Visa declined to comment.Kate Pollock, co-head of competition litigation at Stewarts, the law firm which represented Asda, Argos and Morrison, said that it was pleased that the Court of Appeal had recognised that the fixing of interchange fees “was and is an unlawful infringement of competition law” subject to the question of exemption that is expected to be decided by the CAT in due course.“Our clients now look forward to a swift and final resolution of this matter.” she said.J Sainsbury said in a statement: “We are pleased with the Court of Appeal’s declaration that both Mastercard and Visa’s domestic interchange fees are restrictive of competition. We will consider the judgment carefully and remain confident in the next hearing at the Competition Appeal Tribunal which will examine whether there is any lawful level of interchange fee for either scheme and establish our damages.”This article has been amended to clarify the comments from Kate Pollock.
26;V;Visa Inc;2018-06-25T14:32:31Z;Amex wins US Supreme Court backing for restrictions on merchants;Credit card group can block vendors from steering customers to cheaper payment methods;American Express secured victory in an eight-year legal battle over its terms and conditions for merchants on Monday, when the US Supreme Court said it can block them from steering customers to use cheaper credit card payment methods.The court voted 5-4 that Amex’s merchant restrictions do not stifle competition and said that consumers must be taken into account when weighing up harms and benefits in the credit card market.The ruling is a major victory for the credit card business over retailers and other merchants, who have long chafed at the costs and the restrictions involved in offering card payments to customers.And it could also have wide-ranging implications for other industries where businesses run so-called two-sided marketplaces.American Express is a two-sided platform, where the company deals with merchants on one side and consumers on the other side. The ruling could require antitrust enforcers to prove that increased prices on one side of a market are not outweighed by benefits on the other side.The key feature of transaction platforms is that they cannot make a sale to one side of the platform without simultaneously making a sale to the other“Both sides of the two-sided credit-card market — cardholders and merchants — must be considered,” wrote Justice Clarence Thomas, delivering the majority opinion.American Express shares rose almost 2 per cent on Monday. The company said the Supreme Court’s decision was “a major victory for consumers” as well as for Amex. “It will help to promote competition and innovation in the payments industry,” a spokesperson said.The Department of Justice and 17 states first sued American Express in 2010, along with rivals Visa and Mastercard, arguing that the terms they placed on merchants illegally constrained competition.Visa and Mastercard settled, but Amex fought the case. It argued that the restraint ensured a frictionless experience for customers, allowed it to offer rewards to credit card users, and prevented merchants from undermining its two-sided platform.David Kully, a partner at Holland & Knight, who previously served as chief of the section at the DoJ that sued American Express, said the question of whether the Supreme Court ruling applied to other markets that arguably have two-sided features would have to be litigated in the courts.A key question at the American Express trial in 2014 was the definition of the relevant market.The district judge who oversaw the case defined the market as the merchant side of the platform and said the burden was on American Express to show that any consumer benefit outweighed the harm on the merchant side.The decision was reversed by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which said both sides of the American Express business should have been included in the market definition. It ruled the government should have to prove that harms on one side of the platform outweigh benefits on the other.The state of Ohio led an appeal to the Supreme Court, which the justice department declined to support. On Monday, the court sided with American Express.“Evidence of a price increase on one side of a two-sided transaction platform cannot, by itself, demonstrate an anti-competitive exercise of market power,” wrote Justice Thomas.The Supreme Court cautioned that the need to look at both sides of a two-sided market would not necessarily apply to all cases. The court argued the standard was necessary in the credit card industry because merchants and customers were directly and inextricably linked at the moment of a transaction.“The key feature of transaction platforms is that they cannot make a sale to one side of the platform without simultaneously making a sale to the other,” said Justice Thomas in the opinion.
27;V;Visa Inc;2018-06-08T16:17:19Z;MPs demand tough penalties for financial IT blunders;Tech failures at TSB, Visa, Aviva and Phoenix Wealth anger customers;Finance bosses have come under fire from MPs this week following a series of IT blunders by banks, payment card and pension providers that have caused misery for millions of customers.The influential Treasury select committee called for the chief executive of TSB to resign after the scale of the bank’s IT disaster emerged.In evidence to MPs on the committee on Wednesday, Paul Pester admitted that customers had been subject to aggressive fraud attacks following the systems outage in April that locked hundreds of thousands of people out of their accounts.The incident led to TSB, owned by Sabadell of Spain, facing 70 times the normal level of fraud attacks, Mr Pester told the committee. Over the course of eight days, 2,200 customers experienced attempts to compromise their accounts, of which 1,300 suffered a loss. In total, 93,700 complaints were made about the IT outage, with 10,600 “incidents” or alerts about possible fraud that had “led to a level of payout”.Furthermore, a software blunder also meant 370 customers who wanted to leave TSB found that their regular payments were cancelled because the bank told utility companies and local councils these customers had died, the committee heard. About 12,500 customers have asked to switch from TSB since its IT problems started.Mr Pester apologised “unreservedly” to TSB customers when asked by Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the committee, whether the lender deserved its new nickname of the “Truly Shambolic Bank”.Following the session, Ms Morgan wrote to TSB’s chairman Richard Meddings stating the committee had “lost confidence in [Paul Pester’s] ability to provide a full and frank assessment of the problems at TSB, and to deal with them in the best interests of its customers”.It is the first time the committee has called for the departure of the head of a bank. In a statement, TSB said Mr Pester continued to have the full support of its board.Separately, Ms Morgan has also demanded answers from Visa over last Friday’s system failure which left some customers across Europe unable to make purchases with their cards. Visa blamed the incident on a “hardware failure”.In a letter to Charlotte Hogg, chief executive for Europe at Visa, the committee has demanded to know what went wrong, how Visa will ensure that a similar failure does not happen again and whether customers or merchants will be entitled to compensation.“A third of all spending in the UK is processed by Visa. It’s deeply worrying, therefore, that such a vital part of the country’s payment infrastructure can fail so catastrophically,” said Ms Morgan. “The consequences were sudden and severe. Many consumers and businesses were left stranded on Friday, unable to make or accept payments, with chaos reported in shops,” she said.If the committee is not satisfied with Visa’s responses to its questions, due by June 15, it may consider asking Ms Hogg to provide oral evidence. Following her last appearance before the committee, which was before her time at Visa, Ms Hogg resigned from her post as deputy governor of the Bank of England.On Thursday morning, a software issue at the London Stock Exchange left investors unable to trade for an hour — its worst outage in seven years.This week, the City watchdog was also urged to investigate a string of IT failures in the pensions industry by Mick McAteer, a former board member of the Financial Conduct Authority.About 6,000 savings, retirement and investment customers with Aviva, one of the UK’s leading pension providers, were unable to complete trades or did not receive income payments after glitches with a platform upgrade.Phoenix Wealth, part of the FTSE-listed Phoenix Group, is still working to fix a bungled software upgrade which has seen pension payments fail to reach some of its customers on time for three months in a row.“There’s been a worrying number of IT failures, not just in the banking sector but also pensions and insurance,” said Mr McAteer, who is co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre, a policy think-tank.“It really is time for the Financial Conduct Authority to consider a thematic review into whether the sector has the capacity to deliver and manage major IT upgrades without causing disruption for customers. The FCA really needs to start gathering evidence from consumers, consumer groups and others about the impact of IT failures,” he said.David Aldridge, 58, a Phoenix Wealth customer from Essex, told the Financial Times that the provider had not paid his pension on time for three consecutive months.The most disturbing thing is this is a major company and their attitude is very casual“We were using our savings as a buffer because Phoenix was just not paying when they should have,” said Mr Aldridge. “The most disturbing thing is this is a major company and their attitude is very casual. They just said: ‘We haven’t paid you, but we are working on it’.”Mr Aldridge has been offered £250 in compensation for his pension not being paid on time but has made a formal complaint to the Financial Ombudsman about how he has been treated.In response, Phoenix Wealth said it was still “experiencing some issues with the systems upgrade which is impacting a small number of customers”, adding it would “ensure there is no financial detriment suffered by impacted customers”.The FCA said it had identified data security, resilience and outsourcing as a priority in its latest business plan.Reporting by Martin Arnold, Caroline Binham, Josephine Cumbo and Claer Barrett

On Saturday Visa said its European network had returned to normal, adding that there was no reason to believe the failure was a result of unauthorised access or malicious actors.“A third of all spending in the UK is processed by Visa. It’s deeply worrying, therefore, that such a vital part of the country’s payment infrastructure can fail so catastrophically,” said Ms Morgan.“The consequences were sudden and severe. Many consumers and businesses were left stranded on Friday, unable to make or accept payments, with chaos reported in shops,” she said.The Bank of England regulates Visa, and has the power to fine the company. In a report in February, the BoE said it expected regulated entities in the financial services sector to “have the ability to absorb the impact of an unexpected event while continuing to perform their critical functions.”It said causes of system failures could include cyber threats, the failure of a critical supplier to the regulated company or the failure of the company itself.The letter to Ms Hogg also seeks to establish when Visa first became aware of the problem and how quickly the company responded, how many people were affected and whether Visa has a back-up processing site that can take over in the event of system failures.If the committee is not satisfied with Visa’s responses to its questions, due by June 15, it may consider asking Ms Hogg to provide oral evidence.
29;V;Visa Inc;2018-06-04T08:55:17Z;Visa glitch shows it is high time for digital cash;Arguments for central bank electronic money also support full-reserve bank reforms;The disruption of Visa’s payment network across Europe over the weekend showed that one of the strongest considerations in favour of introducing official electronic money — a central bank-issued equivalent of physical cash — is no idle concern. Some central banks have started worrying that as cash falls into disuse, its absence will erode their ability to fulfil their essential public function of providing a reliable payments system. Electronic transactions between individuals and non-bank businesses are today carried out by private payment networks such as Visa. But what if they fail — as this weekend’s glitch hinted at — and there is no substitute once cash is gone?One (good) answer is that central banks have a duty to provide an electronic retail payments system of their own: a central bank digital currency, or ecash for short. And since the possibility of an emergency payments system in a crisis relies on it being easy and quick to understand and access for everyone, it is really an argument for ensuring there is ecash in general circulation even in normal times.To be concrete: ecash would mean that there would be a form of money that, like cash, is not linked to accounts in private banks and instead directly guaranteed by the central bank, but that, unlike cash, is electronic. In practice the simplest way to implement it would be for everyone to be able to open deposit accounts directly with the central bank, and that these accounts would include the electronic transfer and debit card facilities that are standard with private bank accounts. The thinking on the technical aspects — such as whether ecash should be managed through a centralised ledger or a form of blockchain — is quite advanced. Here I want to highlight the link between ecash and full-reserve banking, another radical reform currently given much attention. A central bank digital currency should not be confused with the Vollgeld or “sovereign money” proposal being put to a referendum in Switzerland this week. But they are close cousins.In a full-reserve banking system, it would be but a small step to introduce central bank ecash. Since all deposits would already be backed by central bank reserves, there would be little disruption to allow people to hold their deposits in the form of central bank reserves directly.Conversely, if ecash were easily accessible, and convertible to and from bank deposits (which would be the point), it would force a move towards higher reserve requirements for banks, or equivalent requirements to hold sufficient assets that are eligible to be pledged against reserves. For if private and public electronic money could be converted into one another at will, then a massive flight from deposits to safer official money is a conceivable possibility for which a central bank must be prepared. And that means ensuring that banks hold enough reserves for that purpose up front, or committing to lending them all the reserves they might need against the banking assets that private deposits fund.All this, in turn, means that the economic effects of ecash and of full-reserve banking are likely to be very similar. Recent Bank of England research suggests ecash would not cause problems for monetary policy and could enhance it. Others have shown it would improve both economic prosperity and stability. All the more reason, then, to think the Swiss full-reserve banking proposal is worth of support.
30;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Visa’s European payment systems back up after outage;Failure leaves businesses without services and highlights problems of cashless society;Visa said on Saturday its European payments network was running as normal after a “hardware failure” on Friday led to a continent-wide outage that left hundreds of small businesses without credit card services.Visa’s payment systems in Europe suffered a serious outage going into the weekend, leaving many businesses and customers across the continent unable to make or receive card payments.“We have no reason to believe this was associated with any unauthorised access or malicious event,” Visa said.The difficulties highlight one of the potential pitfalls of the increasing shift to a “cashless” society. Card payments accounted for 77 per cent of total UK retail sales in October 2017, according to industry body UK Finance. Some countries such as Sweden are even less reliant on cash.More than 95 per cent of debit cards in the UK run on Visa’s network.Paul Lewis, a journalist and personal finance expert, said: “When such problems occur, they seem to take the regulators by surprise. There should be more resilience in the systems that more and more of us rely on. But my advice has always been carry two or three cards, on different networks and providers, and also some cash for your immediate needs.”Users began reporting issues on Friday afternoon, with the outage leading many UK ATMs to run out of money as customers were forced to use cash.Ramzi Kozhani, manager of Cafe Brood by Southwark Cathedral in London, said he feared he had lost as much as £3,000 on a busy Friday afternoon because customers’ cards were declined.He said: “We have had maybe 100 customers affected today when we should be doing big business, and then had to bin the food.”While some retailers reported that they had stopped taking all card payments, larger companies said that not all customers were affected. A spokesperson for Asda, the supermarket chain, said it was experiencing issues in some stores, but its fuel and online sales had not been affected.Bank of Ireland said some of its customers were experiencing issues using their Visa cards, adding: “This is impacting multiple banks across Europe.”Mastercard, which powers a small number of debit cards and the majority of credit cards in the UK, said it had experienced no problems on its network.
31;V;Visa Inc;2018-05-13T22:59:16Z;Consumer spending continues to decline despite UK wage pick-up;Analysis of credit and debit card payments heightens gloom for Britain’s retailers;UK consumer spending is still declining despite the recent pick-up in wage growth, according to an analysis of credit and debit card payments that suggests the arrival of spring weather has not brought much let-up for Britain’s battered retail sector.Household expenditure — adjusted for inflation and seasonal effects — was 2 per cent lower in April compared with the same month one year earlier, according to payment processing company Visa, which published its UK consumer spending index on Monday.Spending has now fallen on this measure for 11 of the past 12 months, and is on track for its worst annual performance since 2012.“With inflation beginning to fall and wages growing faster than expected in recent months, it would have been easy to assume we might be over the worst of the consumer squeeze,” said Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa. “It is clear that consumers remain in belt-tightening mode.”High street retailers have fared worst, with Visa’s index — which is compiled by data company IHS Markit — showing face to face spending down 5.4 per cent year-on-year in April, while e-commerce dropped just 0.1 per cent.This matches the trend seen in official data for the first quarter, with the Office for National Statistics reporting falling sales volumes in each of the first three months of the year.The data also confirms the structural shift in the retail sector, from in-store sales to online shopping, and from spending on “stuff” to expenditure on leisure.Many retailers were hoping that sales would pick up once the unusually bitter weather that kept shoppers off the streets in February and March — a cold front blown in from Siberia, and dubbed the Beast from the East — had passed.The British Retail Consortium’s monthly footfall monitor, also published on Monday, suggests that better weather has brought only a modest upturn that will not be enough to revive the sector’s fortunes. It showed footfall down 3.3 per cent year-on-year in April, with no growth in any region.The Bank of England said last week that stronger wage growth and falling inflation should start to support increased household spending, following a two year squeeze on real incomes.But it also suggested that some people might choose to rebuild savings, rather than spending more freely, especially if they felt less confident about the economic outlook or their own circumstances.Although Visa’s index has often painted a gloomier picture of consumer spending in absolute terms than official data, its trend correlates well with ONS figures and with measures of consumer confidence.The figures are based on all expenditure on Visa cards, but adjusted to strip out transactions such as tax payments and refunds, and to take account of changing payment habits.
32;V;Visa Inc;2018-05-02T04:00:26Z;Santander strikes debit card deal with Mastercard;First of the ‘big five’ banks to move from Visa as Mastercard seeks to grow in the UK;Santander will become the first of the UK’s ‘big five’ high street banks to issue debit cards through Mastercard from next year, marking a major step in the payments group’s efforts to fight Visa’s dominance in the sector.Santander UK, which has more than 9m debit cards in issue — almost 10 per cent of the UK total — will begin moving customers to Mastercard as their existing cards expire from the first quarter of 2019.Mark Barnett, Mastercard divisional president for the UK, said the deal would give it “real scale in the UK debit card market”, and was “proof that Mastercard’s debit card solutions offer all the flexibility, security and convenience banks and their cardholders require in today’s digital age”.More than 95 per cent of debit cards in the UK run on Visa’s network, but Mastercard has signed up several smaller banks since Visa’s European arm was bought out by Visa Inc in 2016. This was previously owned by a co-operative of European banks, with the value of each bank’s stake dependent on the volume of transactions they handled.Analysts warned at the time of the €21bn deal that it could allow Mastercard to win back some of the business that had previously been tied to its rival.TSB — which has around 4.5 per cent of the debit card market — is due to move its debit card portfolio to Mastercard later in the year which, with the Santander agreement, is expected to bring Mastercard’s market share close to 20 per cent.Matt Hall, Santander UK director of banking and unsecured credit, said the partnership “will enable us to give better payment solutions to our customers and look forward to rolling out the new cards from next year”.Mastercard’s push into the UK follows last year’s £700m acquisition of Vocalink, which builds real-time payments infrastructure, from a consortium of British banks.Vocalink is aiming to launch a separate service this year allowing customers to pay for online purchases directly from their current accounts, cutting out the need to use a debit card. The company has signed up several banks that issue cards through Visa — including Barclays and HSBC — to join the programme.
33;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Strong earnings help tech sector end losing streak;;Tech stocks look set to end their lengthy losing streak in style on Thursday after strong corporate earnings underpinned gains for some of the sector’s biggest names.The S&P 500 information technology sector was up 2.2 per cent at halftime in New York, on track for its best day since April 10 and one of its best this year. The gains follow a six-day losing streak to the close on April 25 — the longest since last April — that saw the sector drop 5.3 per cent.The top performer today was Advanced Micro Devices, up 11.7 per cent, in the wake of the chipmaker’s forecast-busting first-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday, and the prospect of even stronger revenue growth in the current quarter.That was a big turnround for AMD, which fell during the main session on Wednesday alongside other chipmakers following a media report the US Department of Justice is investigating whether China’s Huawei Technologies has violated sanctions related to Iran. The drop for semiconductor companies proved a big drag on the sector yesterday.The next best was Facebook, a sector heavyweight, up 9.5 per cent. The social network yesterday reported earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations.Visa and PayPal were also among the top performers in the sector, up 5.2 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively, after the two payments companies also delivered solid quarterly results yesterday.Among other popular tech stocks, Apple was up 0.4 per cent, Netflix added 3.3 per cent and Alphabet gained 2 per cent. Intel, Amazon and Microsoft, which all report after closing bell today, were up 2 per cent, 3.1 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, while the S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent higher.
34;V;Visa Inc;2018-04-25T20:53:38Z;Visa raises full-year profit outlook after solid Q2;;Visa on Wednesday provided further evidence that it is shrugging off any potential threat of disruption to global payments as executives raised their profit outlook for the year.Shares in Visa, which have risen more than 1,000 per cent since its initial public offering 10 years ago, rallied 2 per cent in after-hours trading.In a statement, Alfred Kelly, chief executive, described the performance as “terrific” and said revenue growth had been “better than anticipated”.The California-based company, which connects consumers, vendors and financial institutions, handled almost $2tn of payments globally during its second quarter. Credit and debit card volumes each rose about a tenth from a year ago, assuming currencies were constant.The higher spending helped Visa, which collects fees on the customer transactions, generate $2.6bn of net income in the period.Stripping out one-time items that hit the results a year ago, earnings per share rose 30 per cent, more than forecast.
35;V;Visa Inc;2018-03-16T05:00:41Z;Finance chief of Visa attacks bitcoin ‘bubble’;Vasant Prabhu says extent of speculation has been ‘a real shock’;A top Visa executive has launched one of the most outspoken attacks yet from the financial establishment on the bitcoin craze, saying cryptocurrency was used by “every crook and dirty politician” and speculators who have “no clue”.In an interview with the Financial Times, Vasant Prabhu, chief financial officer of the world’s biggest payment network by market value, recalled encounters he had with ill-informed retail investors that had been “a real shock” to him.“The people asking me are the ones who scare the hell out of me,” he said. “You know, guys like the limo driver to the airport . . . They have no idea what they are doing.”Visa operates at the heart of the mainstream global payments system, connecting about 3bn cardholders, 46m payment locations and 17,000 financial institutions.Recognising the strength of feeling among crypto aficionados who wish to circumvent financial institutions, Mr Prabhu said he lived not far from “true believers” in Silicon Valley who think “people like me are dinosaurs”.A bank teller told Mr Prabhu about six months ago how he planned to sell bitcoin in March, because he knew that was when the price would peak. A young member of Mr Prabhu’s extended family enthused over a Thanksgiving dinner that an $8,000 crypto investment he made had doubled in value.“This is the ultimate thing that you hear about when you have a bubble, when the guy shining your shoes tells you what stock to buy,” the Visa executive said.Every crook and every dirty politician in the world, I bet, is in cryptocurrencyBitcoin has collapsed from a pre-Christmas high above $19,000 to trade at about $8,100 but it is still up eight-fold from the start of last year, according to Bloomberg data.Some of Mr Prabhu’s peers on Wall Street have become wary of speaking out. Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase, said last month he regretted describing bitcoin as a “fraud”— not because he had changed his mind, but because it had become all anyone wanted to talk to him about.Visa, which has a market capitalisation of $279bn, has been peppered with questions from analysts and investors about whether its model will be disrupted by emerging payment systems.So far, it appears to have shrugged off any potential threat. Shares are up more than 1,000 per cent since its initial public offering 10 years ago next week, helped by the digitisation of global payments.The San Francisco-based group is experimenting with the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. It is trialing a blockchain-based platform for banks to facilitate cross-border corporate payments.However, the company does not process or settle transactions in cryptocurrency itself. “With a currency issued by the Federal Reserve, I know who stands behind it,” Mr Prabhu said. With cryptocurrency, he said: “Who’s good for the money? Who the hell knows?”Visa does not block consumers from using its network to buy cryptocurrency, although several banks that issue its cards have implemented such a ban.The company also went to great lengths to comply with know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules, Mr Prabhu said. “We shut people down immediately where we have even the whiff” of wrongdoing, he added.In contrast, he said, cryptocurrencies were a “favourite” for criminals. “It’s very hard to get dirty money through a banking system. Cryptocurrency is phenomenal for all that stuff . . . Every crook and every dirty politician in the world, I bet, is in cryptocurrency.”Chris Skinner, a financial technology author, said it was “complete rubbish” to suggest the main use of cryptocurrencies was criminal. “There is some criminal activity associated with some cryptocurrencies but it is quite minimal,” he said. “It’s a myth that the financial community want to promote.”Mr Prabhu said: “My personal view is that cryptocurrencies are more speculative investment commodities than payment options, operating in a very unsettled regulatory environment. The markets are testing cryptocurrencies today with the volatile fluctuations we’ve seen recently. It’s early days and we’ll watch it very closely.”
36;V;Visa Inc;2018-03-12T13:25:33Z;Weakest start to the year for UK consumer spending since 2012;Visa figures show consumer spending fell 1.1% year-on-year in February;UK consumer spending fell for the ninth time in 10 months in February, marking the weakest start to the year since 2012, according to figures compiled by Visa.The data, published on Monday, showed that consumer spending was 1.1 per cent lower in February, after adjusting for inflation, than the same time last year. This followed a 1.2 per cent year-on-year decline in January.“Consumer spending is at risk of posting one of the worst [first quarter] results on record,” said Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa. “Retailers will no doubt be hoping that the milder weather will put a spring in shoppers’ steps.”Modest growth in online spending — which was just 0.2 per cent higher in February than the same time last year — failed to offset a 2.5 per cent year-on-year decline in “face-to-face” purchases in stores.February marked the slowest pace of annual growth in online spending for 10 months.The payment processing company’s index of consumer spending is compiled from data on all Visa debit and credit card payments, stripping out items such as tax and adjusting for changing consumer preferences for card payments over cash and cheques. Visa cards account for £1 in every £3 spent in the UK.Spending was lower in February this year than last year in half of the eight broad spending categories that the index identifies. Spending fell in real terms on recreation and culture, transport and communication, clothing and footwear, and household goods.But snow at the end of the month failed to dampen growth in spending on hotels, bars and restaurants. Real consumer spending in such establishments was 4.4 per cent higher in February than the same time last year.“The resilience of this sector is somewhat unique, having reported uninterrupted growth since February 2011,” said Mr Antipof.Annabel Fiddes, principal economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the index, said: “Rising living costs, lacklustre wage growth and relatively subdued consumer confidence are all likely playing a part in the ongoing reduction in household spending.“Unless the squeeze on incomes subsides, it looks unlikely that household spending will pick up anytime soon.”On Tuesday, UK chancellor Philip Hammond will present updated official forecasts for the UK economy and public finances. They are expected to provide a more upbeat picture than those published in November, but Mr Hammond has said he will not use this opportunity to make any new tax or spending announcements.However, there are several tax-and-spend measures set to take effect in April that may affect consumer spending patterns, including the third of four years of a planned freeze in the cash value of benefits for working age households.

BBVA did not reveal the size of its investment in solarisBank, but it is understood the two announcements together represent substantially more than £100m of new investment.BBVA has been working to develop its own digital banking offering alongside several investments in fintech groups, and chief executive Carlos Torres Vila said “being a partner of solarisBank will help us grow in the area of ‘banking as a service’ more quickly”.
38;V;Visa Inc;2018-02-27T12:04:27Z;US Olympians leverage Instagram star power to promote sponsors;Athletes project brands to global audience through lucrative social media deals;The Winter Olympics has transformed the social media profiles of several star athletes, highlighting the growing commercial appeal of Instagram-savvy participants as brand ambassadors.Projecting both themselves and their sponsors to a global audience, US Olympians have gained more than 3.6m followers on Instagram, Facebook’s photo-sharing site, since the beginning of the games, providing even better engagement rates for some marketers than those seen during the National Football League’s Super Bowl.Luckily for the losers, social media success — a critical metric for sponsors ranging from Visa to Mountain Dew — is not limited to the best Olympic performers either. An FT analysis showed the popularity of athletes’ profiles was only loosely correlated to performance in the medal tables.Shaun White and Chloe Kim, snowboarders who both won gold medals in the halfpipe, gained more followers than any other athletes, providing a boost for Burton Snowboards, which sponsors both of them. Each picked up more than 500,000 new Instagram followers, taking White to 1.2m and Kim to nearly 750,000.Engagement for Burton, which has fewer followers than White at 1.1m, increased 83 per cent the day after his gold medal win, according to 4C, a marketing technology company that measures TV and social media — metrics are based on active engagement such as mentions, retweets, comments and likes. Engagement for Toyota, another of Kim’s sponsors, increased 574 per cent the day after her gold medal, 4C found. This number outstrips the boost brands like Under Armour — which sponsors basketball player Steph Curry and football quarterback Tom Brady — recorded after the NBA finals (50 per cent) and the Super Bowl (264 per cent), traditional highlights of US marketers’ year. Marketing agencies told the FT these increases in the number of followers and social engagement will translate into dollars. Wasserman, which represents Hilary Knight, the US women’s hockey forward and three-times Olympic medallist, estimated that the value of her social engagements doubled after winning Olympic gold, from $39,000 to $87,000. Knight, who is sponsored by Visa and Xfinity, gained more than 20,000 followers on Instagram alone. “Social media has become integral to activating athlete sponsorships, and if a company is not thinking about how to leverage an athlete’s social media influence, they’re simply missing out,” said Dedra DeLilli, a group manager for Toyota Olympic/Paralympic marketing over email. “When a brand successfully drives home an association with an athlete that’s creating significant games-time chatter, brand reach is almost limitless.”Kim — with more than 700,000 Instagram followers and 300,000 Twitter followers — is among those who have proven their ability to drive engagement for brands. She gained nearly 100,000 followers in the lead up to the halfpipe finals, her only Olympic event, and her profile continued to skyrocket as she tweeted about breakfast sandwiches and being “hangry” between runs before winning Olympic gold. Unlike many athletes who choose to sign contracts spanning the years between Olympics Games, Kim’s deals will, by choice, be up when she turns 18 years old this spring. Adam Rippon, the first openly gay figure skater on the US Olympic team, has been another standout star of these games despite not winning an individual medal, though he helped the US win bronze in the figure skating team event. Rippon, who had no major sponsors going into the games, picked up more than 400,000 followers on Instagram. His following had nearly quadrupled in size since the beginning of the games two weeks ago. “In general, when you have athletes or celebrities who come across as very authentic and very transparent, that tends to play very well on social media,” said Aaron Goldman, 4C chief marketing officer. “Adam in particular was always saying what was on his mind and speaking freely and that’s the essence and DNA of social media when done best.”Many athletes already had niche groups of followers, but the Olympics has opened a broader array of brands looking to reach the mainstream audiences they have gained. “There’s a global appeal to the Olympic Games that helps people break out of more narrow groups that they would be ordinarily be reaching,” Mr Goldman said.He added: “Instagram is a highly visual platform, and it’s certainly growing quite fast. It’s connected to Facebook, so all the data you have for your audience targeting that you have on Facebook you can also apply to Instagram.”The trick for athletes now will be to continue the momentum. Shelley Pisarra, senior vice-president of research and insights at Wasserman, said: “Especially coming off the Olympics, you can go into a dry period. You need to keep pushing content out there so you have a story to tell.”And while athletes do not do what they do ‘for the gram’ — slang for Instagram — the games gives them a boost they can benefit from until the next Winter Olympics.
39;V;Visa Inc;2018-02-18T16:48:51Z;Worldpay and Visa in row over cryptocurrency charges;Payment processers are investigating duplicate card payments;"Payments processing companies Worldpay and Visa are at the centre of complaints from cryptocurrency traders after erroneous charges were levied on their accounts.Dozens of users of America’s biggest cryptocurrencies exchange, Coinbase, took to Reddit, the social network, late last week to complain about unexpected charges on credit and debit cards used to buy digital currency.Some people claimed their bank accounts had been wiped out before refunds were applied, while others said they were hit with overdraft fees. “I was charged four times and it completely drained my account,” claimed one user on Reddit. Blame for the charges initially fell on Coinbase, which has grown rapidly over the past year as digital currencies such as bitcoin have hit the headlines.Coinbase has in the past faced other payments issues, including earlier this year a bout of seriously delayed wire transfers. However, the group was not to blame for the erroneous charges this time.Over the weekend Worldpay and Visa issued a joint a statement conceding that “this issue was not caused by Coinbase”.Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said that the problem related to the merchant category code (MCC) that the payment processers assigned to Coinbase. MCCs are crucial for transactions processing as they help card issuers assess the risk of accepting a transaction. Coinbase claimed on Thursday that Visa had caused the problem, but Visa denied that it made “any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions cardholders are reporting”. In the past Visa has pointed out that it is up to the financial institution working on behalf of the merchant to transmit the MCCs to Visa’s payments system; they are also responsible for assigning the MCC code to the merchant. Worldpay fulfils this role for Coinbase, according to the two people briefed on the matter. Join us to discuss what’s next for bitcoin and blockchain, with David Gerard, author of the ‘Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain’, and Alex Batlin, founder of Trustology, on February 27 in LondonIn a statement on Friday, Worldpay said that “we are actively working with and engaging all parties involved — including the card networks, issuing banks, other processors and Coinbase — to resolve this issue”. Worldpay did not respond to further requests for comment. One of the people briefed on the situation said that by Saturday evening, the “root cause” of the problem was still unknown. The row is the latest example of the increasingly blurred lines between the rapidly growing crypto industry and the traditional financial sector, and illustrates the complex issues faced by the financial institutions as a growing number of individuals seek to pile into the cryptocurrencies market.Regulators in countries including the US, Germany and France have spoken out recently about their concerns over a lack of clear rules for digital currencies, in contrast to the highly-regulated financial industry.

40;V;Visa Inc;2018-02-12T00:02:21Z;UK consumer spending falls for first time in 5 years, says Visa;January credit card index shows winter continues to send chill through high street;A fall in high street shopping and spending on transport drove a decline in overall UK consumer spending in January for the first time in five years, according to figures from Visa.The payment processing company’s UK spending index showed a year-on-year drop of 1.2 per cent last month, which followed a decline of 1 per cent in December.Eight of the past nine months have now experienced a year-on-year fall in consumer spending, according to the index.Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit, the data company that compiles the index, said the “weak expenditure trends in 2017 have carried through into 2018, as households continue to face rising living costs and lacklustre wage growth”.Visa’s index is compiled from data on all Visa card payments, stripping out items such as tax, and adjusted for seasonal patterns and to reflect consumer preferences for card payments over cash and cheques. Visa cards account for £1 in every £3 spent in the UK.The figures showed that winter continued to bear down on the high street, with “face-to-face” spending in stores falling 4 per cent, following December’s drop of 2.6 per cent. While online spending rose 1.5 per cent year-on-year in January, the rate of growth slowed compared with previous months.Marks and Spencer and Tesco were among the big retailers to have suffered in recent months, their poor performance over Christmas reflected in falling share prices.Last week, Debenhams cut a quarter of its shop managers after issuing a post-Christmas profits warning, attributing poor sales to rising inflation.According to Visa, spending in the “transport and communication” category suffered the biggest drop in January, down 6.5 per cent year on year. Mark Antipof of Visa said this was not unexpected, given the steep fall in car sales in recent months.Spending on recreation and culture declined 4.3 per cent in January compared with the previous year, the steepest drop in almost seven years.There were more modest reductions in spending on household goods, food and beverages and clothing and footwear, while spending on hotels, restaurants and bars recorded a rise of 3.7 per cent.Spending on miscellaneous goods, including health, beauty and jewellery, went up 6.1 per cent in January, reflecting consumer preference for small treats over big-tickets items, Mr Antipof said.
41;V;Visa Inc;2018-02-09T17:33:21Z;American Express GBT to buy Hogg Robinson for £410m;Proposed tie-up pushes UK group’s shares 50% higher;FTSE 250 group Hogg Robinson has agreed to a takeover by the business travel arm of American Express worth up to £410m, in a tie-up that would result in the merger of two of the world’s largest corporate travel companies.Hogg Robinson, the UK-based business travel agency, on Friday said it had agreed to sell Fraedom, its payments technology subsidiary, to the US credit card giant Visa in a deal worth £141.8m.Separately, American Express Global Business Travel s offered to pay between 110p and 120p for each Hogg Robinson share. This values its British rival at between £375m and £410m. The final price will be dependent on the outcome of the proposed deal with Visa to acquire Fraedom.“Today’s deal is attractive for Hogg Robinson Group’s shareholders and an exciting next step for Fraedom,” said William Brindle, chief operating officer at Hogg Robinson.The UK company’s takeover by American Express GBT is expected to be completed in the second quarter of this year. After the complex transaction was announced, shares in Hogg Robinson jumped nearly 50 per cent to £116p.The merged entity is intended to offer its business customers a comprehensive suite of travel products and services, while combining technology and infrastructure in a way that they believe will “ maximise efficiencies”.“The complementary geographical footprints of each company will improve the global scale and reach of our business, enabling us to achieve efficiencies across a best-in-class platform and accelerate growth,” said Doug Anderson, chief executive of American Express GBT.American Express GBT is a joint venture between US credit card group American Express and a consortium of investors led by Certares, the private equity firm.The final deal requires Hogg Robinson to secure the assent of its shareholders, although the company has said it is confident that it will win their approval.Adam Epstein, co-founder of Teleios Capital, which owns 14 per cent in Hogg Robinson, said his group “welcomes this offer which we believe represents a good outcome for all shareholders. We are pleased to see that the company has received the recognition it deserves.”In the financial year ended March 31, 2017, Fraedom generated pre-tax profit of £8.1m on revenues of £33.1m. Hogg Robinson, which was launched in 1845 as an insurance broker, reported revenue of £302m and an underlying operating profit of £41.2m for the same period.

43;V;Visa Inc;2018-01-15T00:01:30Z;Festive shoppers shun high street;December footfall slumps amid strong Christmas performance online;Britain’s high streets and shopping centres have started trading in 2018 in serious trouble following a precipitous drop in shopper numbers over the Christmas period.While retailers’ results and early indications of consumer spending over the festive season have been mixed, the big losers were bricks-and-mortar retailers where the number of people shopping fell 3.5 per cent in December, the worst monthly result since the economic recovery started to pick up in 2013.The paucity of shoppers across Britain complete the picture of a strong Christmas sales period online offset by weakness in physical stores.The December footfall figures from Springboard, the retail information company, showed a much larger drop in the number of people visiting shops than other months last year, in which the fall averaged only 0.7 per cent.Although December always sees much greater activity on the high street than any other month, consumers this year were increasingly attracted to shopping online from home rather than trekking to the stores.When they went shopping it was often to collect items bought online, leading to retail parks, where parking is easier, faring better than high streets and shopping centres, according to Springboard.The cold weather partly encouraged the move online, but the decline in retail footfall was nationwide with the biggest falls in Scotland, where consumer numbers fell at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent, the South West where they were down 5.2 per cent and London which saw a decline of 3.7 per cent.The same pattern has been evident in the retail results released since the new year with traditional retailers without strong online sales such as House of Fraser and Debenhams struggling, while Next and online fashion retailer Boohoo performed more strongly.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said the sharp decline in footfall highlighted the “transformed” retail industry with a shift online. “Retail parks fared slightly better than high streets by providing Christmas shoppers with the draw and convenience of parking, easy click-and-collect, and leisure facilities,” she said.The evidence on the strength of consumer spending in December is mixed at the moment. Visa reported a 1 per cent decline in spending on its cards, after adjusting for inflation in December with most of the drop coming from falling high street sales.The BRC, which measures only retail spending in shops and online but not in entertainment activities, found that overall spending among its members had risen 1.4 per cent in December compared with the previous year, but also showed a shift into food, clothes and online purchases and away from gifts and durable goods purchases in shops.Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said the footfall in non-food stores on the high street had suffered a “severe drop” of 5.1 per cent in December and fewer of the shops could catch passing traffic so individual shops’ footfall had fallen even more.Indicating that the writing might be on the wall for some high street stores, she said, “shops are losing footfall more quickly than wider retail locations and so have a declining customer base”.
44;V;Visa Inc;2018-01-08T00:01:03Z;Britain’s consumers spend less for fourth straight month;Lean times for retailers as household expenditure falls 1 per cent in December;Consumer spending fell for the fourth consecutive month in December, rounding off the weakest annual performance for household expenditure since 2012, according to analysis based on debit and credit card payments.Visa’s UK consumer spending index, which is compiled by data company IHS Markit, shows that households’ expenditure was 1 per cent lower, after adjusting for inflation, in December 2017 than in the same month a year earlier. The index is based on total spending on Visa credit, debit and prepaid cards, which account for £1 in every £3 spent in the UK.Over 2017 as a whole, consumers spent 0.3 per cent less in real terms than they did in 2016, according to Visa — the first year-on-year decline in spending since 2012.“Christmas rounded off another lean year for retailers,” said Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa. “Despite some large retailers signalling a strong Christmas performance, it is clear that the high street has suffered recently, while online spending has held up.”Consumer spending was squeezed in 2017 by a sharp increase in inflation and sluggish wage growth, despite unemployment falling to a 42-year low. Inflation was high principally because the devaluation of sterling after the 2016 Brexit vote made imported goods more expensive and pushed up prices in the shops.Spending on the high street was 2.7 per cent lower in real terms in December than in the same month a year earlier, while online spending was 2 per cent higher, according to Visa.The latest data also suggest consumers are continuing to devote a growing share of their budgets to eating and drinking out, rather than buying physical items. Spending in hotels, bars and restaurants was 4.7 per cent higher in real terms in December 2017 than in the same month a year earlier.The new figures come after a week in which British retailers reported mixed experiences over the Christmas season. Debenhams continued to witness a decline in sales, as more consumers shopped online rather than in stores. But Next, the high street clothing retailer, reported strong sales growth. Clothing sales also performed well for John Lewis, but a decline in purchases of other products left their sales slightly down overall compared to December 2016.Continuing changes in when and how people shop can make it difficult to assess overall spending levels on the basis of information on only a subset of expenditures.The Visa index is based on all expenditure on Visa cards. But the figures are adjusted to strip out certain items, such as tax payments, and to take account of people’s growing preference for paying by card, rather than cash or cheque. The headline figures are also adjusted to take account of seasonal changes in spending patterns and differences in the number of trading days per month from year to year.
45;V;Visa Inc;2018-01-03T18:25:01Z;China’s protectionism comes home to roost;The US block of the Ant/MoneyGram deal is part of a larger backlash;A decade ago, most global companies’ strategic presentations gave pride of place to plans for China. This position is now taken by other areas — big data or artificial intelligence, perhaps. What has changed? China is now bigger, richer and more influential on the world stage. The vicissitudes of management fashion may have something to do with it. But the most powerful driver is probably years of hard experience. As China’s economy has matured, protectionism has remained one of its key organising principles.Global companies maintain their presence in China, depend on its manufacturing capacity, and hire its graduates. In some areas — luxury goods, cars, iPhones — they sell a lot of products there. But the “China First” approach pursued by Beijing has served to shift many industries’ priorities.This is the crucial context for news that opposition from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has sunk the $1.2bn acquisition of US cash transfer company MoneyGram by China’s Ant Financial.It is plain that if the positions were switched, with an American bidder and a Chinese target, China would block the deal. Other than, perhaps, information technology — where the “ great firewall of China” constitutes the world’s biggest non-tariff trade barrier — few Chinese industries are more protected than finance. The country’s banks are state-owned. Foreign banks are allowed to operate in the country, but various official barriers mean they have never made much headway there, despite big investments and official pledges of increased openness. It took a 2012 ruling against China by the World Trade Organization for its market to be opened — nominally — to global payment processors such as Visa and MasterCard. Since the ruling, Chinese regulators have dragged their feet in allowing outsiders to set up shop.Whether the MoneyGram deal would have presented a true security risk to the US (the only basis on which Cfius is allowed to rule) is debatable. But the politics are clear. Other than the particular companies that have received premium bids from Chinese suitors, there is no constituency willing to stand up for Chinese investment in the US. Business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, rather than lamenting federal heavy-handedness, have expressed their own worries about China’s trade policies.The anti-China mood in Washington is not restricted to the avowedly and indiscriminately protectionist administration of Donald Trump (the president appoints the officials who staff Cfius). It is bipartisan, and was already taking hold under former president Barack Obama, who blocked the Chinese takeover of the semiconductor equipment maker Aixtron.The busted deal follows other measures to restrict Chinese access to world markets in the US, Europe and other countries. But this one must sting. Mobile payments, Ant’s core business, is the cutting edge of Chinese consumer technology. Jack Ma, who chairs Alibaba, Ant’s parent company, is Chinese tech’s global face, and he made a special effort to court President Trump with the promise of US jobs.The US and the world may only be responding in kind to Chinese protectionism. It would nonetheless be a tragedy if the story ended there. Yes, it is understandable that the world demands reciprocity. But trade officials must keep their eyes firmly on the goal of a more open China — not domestic markets protected from Chinese competition.

46;V;Visa Inc;2017-12-14T09:41:11Z;Black Friday effect: UK retail sales spring back with 1.1% rise in November;;Brits hit the shops in November, taking advantage of Black Friday offers after a cautious Autumn, but it is still unclear whether strong retail sales growth in the month represents an definitive end to the squeeze on household incomes.The annual growth in the volume of sales was up to 1.6 per cent in November, compared with a fall recorded in October. In the month alone, the Office for National Statistics recorded a large 1.1 per cent increase in the volume of sales, much higher than economists’ expectations of a 0.4 per cent gain.The latest figures show that retail spending has been recovering after a sharp dip around the turn of last year and are now growing at a steady rate, although slower than the pace seen before the EU Referendum.Rhian Murphy, ONS Senior Statistician said:Underlying retail sales growth remained reasonably strong in the last few months. Household goods stores had a good November, with a number of businesses saying that Black Friday promotions boosted sales.Last year’s November data also showed very strong performance on the High Street, but it was followed by an apparently difficult December and January trading period.Economists caution that the seasonal adjustment in the official figures might be lagging a change in shopping patterns with people bringing forward spending into the Black Friday period in November and then spending less in December and the January sales.The figures contradict estimates from Visa, the credit and debit card company, which estimated that spending on cards was down 0.9 per cent in November compared with a year earlier.
47;V;Visa Inc;2017-12-11T00:04:03Z;Fresh fall in consumer spending casts Christmas gloom;Shoppers rein in purchases of expensive items in favour of ‘smaller treats’;"Consumer spending has fallen for the third month in a row, according to analysis based on debit and credit card payments, as Britons curb their shopping habits in response to a prolonged squeeze on their pay.The Visa Consumer Spending index, which is compiled by data company IHS Markit, fell 0.9 per cent in November from a year earlier. The index is based on total spending on Visa debit, credit and prepaid cards — which account for £1 in every £3 of all UK spending — adjusted for inflation and various other factors.While the annual decline in November was milder than the 2.1 per cent drop in October, Visa said spending was “still on track for its worst annual performance in five years”.Mark Antipof, Visa’s chief commercial officer, said he now anticipated the first fall in overall Christmas spending by consumers since 2012.Consumers powered the economy in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, but this year retail sales growth has slowed as consumer confidence has weakened. This has coincided with a renewed squeeze on workers’ pay packets as inflation has overtaken stubbornly weak wage growth.Visa’s data show that shoppers spent less on expensive items such as cars and Christmas trips in November, but more on “miscellaneous goods” like cosmetics and visits to beauty salons. Mr Antipof called this the “lipstick effect”: a trend where “people opt for smaller treats [while] at the same time tightening their belts when it comes to larger purchases”.Black Friday — the sales event that has become a focus of the pre-Christmas shopping season — failed to boost overall spending in November though it did seem to result in more people shopping online and fewer on the high street. Online spending was 2.4 per cent higher than last year while “face-to-face” spending was 3.5 per cent lower.Annabel Fiddes, principal economist at IHS Markit, said the figures ""add to the relatively downbeat assessment of UK consumer spending, as households budgets continue to be squeezed by rising living costs and lacklustre wage growth. Unless the squeeze on households unwinds and consumer confidence strengthens, it seems unlikely that consumer spending trends will improve anytime soon”.The latest official forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, suggest pay will grow an average 0.6 per cent a year in real terms in the six years to 2022, much less than the 2 per cent or so that was typical before the financial crisis.The darker outlook for consumer spending has contributed to new economic forecast downgrades from the British Chambers of Commerce. The business lobby group has cut its economic growth expectations from 1.6 to 1.5 per cent in 2017, from 1.2 to 1.1 per cent in 2018, and from 1.4 to 1.3 per cent in 2019.“The UK economy is in a challenging period with growth likely to remain well below average for a prolonged period,” said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC.“Continued uncertainty over Brexit and the burden of upfront cost pressures facing businesses is likely to stifle business investment, while falling real wage growth is expected to continue to weigh on consumer spending.” "
48;V;Visa Inc;2017-11-23T12:32:31Z;Black Friday: The workers who make the day a retail success;How will employees, from operations directors to security guards, spend the day?;Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving in the US, when retailers offer discounts and short-term sales in the run-up to Christmas. In recent years it has also become a big shopping event in the UK, with many retailers offering discounts — and there have been scenes of chaos in stores as customers fight over bargains.Behind the news reports and the sales figures, though, are the employees at retailers and distribution centres responsible for the smooth running of Black Friday. Their working days reflect how this event has become central to the retail year.We spend the whole year planning for Black Friday, which for Amazon is an event that runs for a week leading up to the main day. Things like the Echo home speaker and Fire tablets have big discounts.My focus is on outgoing operations, so I need to make sure shipments leave in perfect condition and on time. At Tilbury we have a robotics system that allows us to hold 50 per cent more inventory, which means we are able to ramp up our stock ready for our Black Friday event. The system can produce orders faster while reducing the amount of walking staff have to do.Working closely with people across different teams, such as engineers, I make sure everything is ready and in place — such as making sure my staff are adequately trained across multiple processes. Amazon UK takes on 20,000 additional staff for the seasonal period. I also work across teams to ensure we have contingency plans should something go wrong.To give an example of a challenge we have overcome: at a time of day when we were handling higher volumes of orders, we had problems with a roller that assists the conveyor. We got different people from various teams with different skills and were able to figure the problem out quickly and fix it. The solution has been implemented in other places where we have the same technology.We used to have customers starting shopping for Christmas the first week of November, but now they all wait until Black Friday to buy things that are over £70.It’s a pain in the bum, but it is also good fun because it’s an almost impossible challengeThis means the eight-week window we used to have to get rid of Christmas stock is now being squeezed down to four weeks. It is getting worse each year.Because people hold off from shopping until late November, we actually have the same amount of orders, but half the time to deal with them. It’s a pain in the bum, but it is also good fun because it’s an almost impossible challenge.There are six of us working in the office, including my co-founder Eddie Latham and I, and six people in the warehouse. But Black Friday is the one day where everyone is equal, and we are all in the warehouse picking up packages.Last year we sold about £350,000 worth of goods and this year my gut feeling says it will be closer to £500,000. That will make around 10,000 parcels. You can pack an item every 32 or 33 seconds if you really put your mind to it.We have to get it right on Black Friday, because it’s the most important day of the year. A lot of our customers return all year round, so if we can get everything right we can guarantee customer flow for the rest of the year. That’s completely new — it wasn’t the case five years ago. We open at 6am, three hours earlier than usual.This year it will be a voice-activated ChristmasThis year it will be a voice-activated Christmas. Most of our top-selling gifts have some element of voice control. Staff need to be able to demonstrate Amazon Echo in store accurately — I hear ‘Hi Alexa’ all day long.Tech that goes with tech is also big this year — smart lightbulbs, thermostats and stuff like that. It’s important customers leave knowing how to work them because lots won’t be opened until Christmas morning.I try to keep staff energised. It’s a special day, so we buy them breakfast, lunch, all drinks and everything they need.The queues are long, but it’s quite exciting. Most customers like it. We entertain with drinks and snacks, and give product demos. We have never seen any customers fighting, because it’s very well managed. These days, “click and collect” means there is no reason to fight — you just reserve items online.Most of the time is spent making sure customers are looked after. All through the day, we’re taking deliveries, and we need to make sure the shelves are full. This year, we have more stock than ever before — and 4,000 deals.I am a security officer with a CCTV licence, so I’m both on the shop floor and in the control room scanning the cameras. For the past five years I have been working at Eden shopping centre in High Wycombe, and last year was the first time I worked during Black Friday.When something happens we . . . try to calm the situation down — try to get everyone smilingThe centre was definitely more busy last year compared with 2015, and we have several more shops participating this year. My colleagues have in previous years experienced situations that have gotten a bit rowdy, a bit of pushing and shoving in queues, but no major instances. When something happens we go and talk to both parties to try to calm the situation down — try to get everyone smiling.It is a really exciting day at work for us, because it is much more busy and you get quite a lot of interaction with customers. We also get to hunt some bargains down during our own lunch break. I have been saving up some pennies for a few tech gadgets I want to get for my stepdad.I personally love busier days — and Black Friday is most certainly busy.At John Lewis we prepare obsessively for Black Friday. We start having weekly reviews in September to make sure we have the right capacity across teams. This week we are having two or three calls a day with the central buyers and merchandisers, the online team, the IT team — just to make sure we are all aligned.1,800 — 2,000The number of extra staff hired during Black Friday week at John LewisBut when Black Friday comes it is our day. It is when the rest of the business says, “It’s over to you, chaps”. They are there supporting and updating but it is up to us in distribution.We get in between 1,800 and 2,000 extra people to help out during Black Friday week — it is the busiest week of the year for us. Last year we sold for just under £200m in that week, which is around 10 times as much as we would sell during our quietest week.On Friday I get into our warehouses in Milton Keynes at 5am. A lot of deals go live on midnight so there is always a bit of early interest from the real savvy shoppers. A few years ago shopping would kick off at 9am as people got to their computers at work, but now people start earlier as they shop on mobiles during their commute.I’m responsible for the technology team in Europe and I’ve been with Visa for more than 13 years now.There’s a lot of focus on Black Friday throughout the year to make sure we are ready for these events. So hopefully, Friday itself will be a very dull day — that’s because of the work we’ve done in advance to make sure that our systems have sufficient capacity to cope with any extra demand.From a personal perspective, this means that me and my team will be focused very much on our core authorisation system during this event. That’s the one that allows, effectively, an issuing bank to authorise a transaction that a merchant is requesting.At a peak period, we will process around 17,000 transactions a second — that’s the level we will be at during this event. [On an average day, it is 12,000 a second.]The role that Visa play in people’s lives in making sure that the transactions are processed without any failure is critical. It’s important that we fulfil the promise of the Visa brand to those cardholders.Black Friday is a useful test-bed for Christmas so we have a lot of contingencies, because if we find Black Friday was busier than we envisaged, we bring forward some of our Christmas recruits.This is a tiring time for me and my team, but also a very exciting oneI have 450 extra people at Medway [in the time leading up to Christmas] — a 45 per cent increase. A lot of people come back year after year, so it’s quite nice to make their acquaintance again. Some are relatives of employees — it’s quite a family thing. They are very necessary to meet the extra demand — without them we would have a serious problem.This is a tiring time for me and my team, but also a very exciting one, because we thrive at this time of year.
49;V;Visa Inc;2017-11-01T05:00:38Z;Millennials play in the credit card casino;Amex and JPMorgan are the biggest winners from a closed financial system;Kenneth Chenault knows how to play the game of life: the chairman and chief executive of American Express has received at least $370m during his 17-year tenure there. He was declared “the gold standard for corporate leadership”, by Warren Buffett, a long-time Amex investor, when he announced his departure.Mr Chenault also knows when to take his chips off the table. The US credit card business, especially for high end cards such as Amex Platinum, is more competitive than it used to be. A points scramble has intensified since JPMorgan Chase launched its Sapphire Reserve card last year, with an annual fee of $450 and an initial sign-up bonus worth $1,500 in points.His departure is an opportunity to ask questions about how card companies prosper, particularly in the US. The Supreme Court this month agreed to hear a case challenging Amex’s practice of barring merchants from steering customers towards cards that charge lower transaction fees. The ultimate question is who loses and who wins in what is an oddly structured market.The traditional answer to the question is clear enough: people who pay for goods and service in cash lose, while card holders gain. As one study found, it involves “a regressive transfer from low income to high income consumers . . . amplified substantially by the practice of paying rewards”.This is how the transfer works: companies such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover levy a charge on sellers of two per cent for each transaction (Amex’s average merchant charge is 2.4 per cent, which is why it tries to stop steering). Stores are barred by contract from charging card users more, so prices rise about 1 per cent for everyone, whether they pay by cash or card.Some of the fees are channelled back by credit card companies to their customers in rewards and, since Discover launched the first cashback card in 1986, cash rebates averaging 1 to 2 per cent. Since rewards cards such as Amex tend to be held by people with prime credit scores, they gain most.The big winner is the house, as in any casino. Amex charged $18.7bn in merchant fees last year and paid out $6.8bn in rewardsRecently, the market has become more like a game. The Sapphire Reserve card shook up Amex by offering top users superior rewards in return for a large annual fee. Those who play their cards right, earning triple points for travel and dining, can gain high returns. A Sapphire Reserve card holder could gain $7,950 net of fees over 10 years, Barclays analysts estimate.This has sparked a contest among millennials with good credit, an aptitude for games, and time to plan their spending cleverly. Some apply for multiple cards to maximise rewards, unlike traditional users. “The question is not just how much disposable income you have but how much disposable time,” says Robert Harrow, an analyst at the research group ValuePenguin.The contest has made life less comfortable for Amex, which had to raise its rewards by 21 per cent in the third quarter of this year. The total rewards paid by the top six US card issuers doubled to $23bn between 2010 and 2016, attracting more people to use credit. US credit card debt now exceeds $1tn, and Americans rate credit cards as their favourite payment method.Like casinos, card issuers do not want their customers to master their games too well. Casinos frown on blackjack players who change the odds by counting cards, although it is legal. Both Amex and JPMorgan strive to prevent people signing up for cards for welcome rewards and later dropping them. Amex changed its terms this year to prohibit “abuse, misuse or gaming”.The big winner is the house, as in any casino. Amex charged $18.7bn in merchant fees last year and paid out $6.8bn in rewards. Most card users are not single-minded enough to obtain the highest potential returns. Discover card holders can get 5 per cent cash back per quarter on $1,500 of purchases in some categories, but its average rewards rate is only 1.3 per cent.Amex gains most from what it calls its “closed loop” — it issues cards and handles transactions. Its degree of control has similarities to Nintendo, which sells both consoles and games and this week raised sales projections for its Switch console. Complete control has its privileges: Amex’s US card business made a 35 per cent return on capital last year, far higher than investment banks.The growth of super-prime cards has increased competition but it ultimately reinforces the credit card networks. The largest transfer of wealth is now from poorer cash buyers to millennial gamers but the latter have to work hard for their points and are rewarded in the currency of the card issuer.While rewards have risen, little has affected where they come from — the US card market’s high transaction fees. Unlike the EU, which capped some transaction fees in 2015, the US relies largely on competition to minimise card purchasing costs and the price distortions that they create.To judge by the profitability of Amex and others, competition is not working as well as it should. More of the “swipe economics” of transactions are being passed through to the most energetic users but there is room for reform in the market as a whole.

50;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;MasterCard earnings, sales jump on higher transaction volumes;;MasterCard revealed on Tuesday a bigger than expected rise in its quarterly profits and revenues, bolstered by higher transaction volumes amid steady growth in the global economy.The New York-based company said its revenues climbed 18 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter to $3.4bn. Net income rose to $1.4bn, or $1.34 a share, from $1.2bn, or $1.08 a share in the same three-month period in 2016.Wall Street analysts had forecast EPS of $1.23, on revenues of $3.28bn.“These results reflect a continued momentum in strengthening and extending relationships with our partners and customers,” said chief executive Ajay Banga.MasterCard provides the means for merchants to process credit card sales by authorising transactions and facilitating the transfer of funds between both parties. Like its US rival Visa, it has benefited from an uptick both in the global economy and the usage of credit cards by consumers.Switched transactions at MasterCard climbed 17 per cent to $16.9bn in the third quarter, meanwhile the gross dollar volume of transactions rose 10 per cent to $1.4tn. Cross-border transactions were up 15 per cent.MasterCard shares have rallied this year by 44.3 per cent, part of a broad rally in the shares of technology companies. They advanced 1.1 per cent in pre-market action in New York.
51;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Wall St falls from record levels as investors digest earnings;;US stocks retreated from record levels on Wednesday as investors digested a batch of disappointing earnings.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 2,551.37 driven by a 2.2 per cent drop in the telecoms sector and 1.1 per cent slide in industrials. Each of the 11 major sectors on the S&P 500 and 84 per cent of stocks on the index were in the red.Meanwhile, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 23,335.83 after Boeing, the heaviest weighted component on the benchmark index, slid 2.3 per cent to $259.90 having posted disappointing results. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 6,527.90.Chipotle was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 after it posted disappointing quarterly results, raising concerns about a recovery at the burrito chain. AT&T weighed on telecoms after the company said its quarterly sales fell more than forecast and Advanced Micro Devices also took a hit after saying it expects revenues to fall in the current quarter.However the results weren’t all dire. Payments company Visa and defence group Northrop Grumman both advanced after their results topped expectations.Investors appeared to ignored upbeat durable goods data in the US and sales of newly built homes, which rose by the most since 1992 amid an increase in sales in the South that was battered by a string of hurricanes. They also await updates on who President Donald Trump may nominate to succeed Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair.Wednesday’s sell-off left the S&P 500 at risk of snapping a second consecutive “perfect week” of record closing highs. The move came amid a pick up in volatility with the Vix volatility index, Wall Street’s fear gauge which measures the short-term volatility implied by S&P 500 option prices, rose 14 per cent (1.67 points) to 12.74 and was up 27 per cent on the week.Elsewhere in markets, US Treasuries pared back their losses. The yield on the 10-year, which had fallen to a 7-month low was up 2 basis points to 2.439 per cent. Yields move inversely to price. Meanwhile, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of peers, slid 0.1 per cent to 93.67.
52;V;Visa Inc;2017-09-14T04:00:39Z;The relentless rise of tap and pay;470m transactions made in the month of June alone;Our growing propensity to “tap and pay” on contactless cards. The payment system was introduced in the UK 10 years ago, speeding up smaller value payments by not requiring shoppers to enter their pin number.From a standing start in 2007, 470m transactions were made in the month of June alone. In the first six months of this year, Britons tapped and paid to the tune of £23bn, almost matching the £25bn recorded for the whole of last year. There are now around 111m contactless cards in issue.Ten years ago, this figure was just 250,000. UK Finance, which represents the finance and banking industries, reports that fewer than 2 per cent of them were actually used to “tap and pay” back in 2007.In recent years, however, usage has boomed. Even the Church of England has got in on the act, trialling contactless payments to complement the age-old collection plate at 40 churches around the UK.Convenience, in a word. If you thought using your cash card was easy, it is nothing compared with tapping your card on the reader at one of the 500,000 terminals around the UK. Over the years, the limit that shoppers can spend without entering their Pin has increased from £10 in 2007 to £30 in 2015.Last year, card payments — including Pin and contactless transactions — overtook cash for the first time, according to figures from the British Retail Consortium. Contactless accounted for about a third of all card transactions.And we are using contactless mainly to buy booze and food, it seems. In 2016, we spent an average of almost £10 per transaction at food and drink retailers, including supermarkets and off-licences, accounting for 43 per cent of all contactless payments in the UK.Contactless accounts for more than 90 per cent of all card payments on public transport.Consumer group Which? has its doubts. Its research has shown that thieves could potentially spend up to £200 on a stolen card before they were asked to provide a Pin.However, Financial Fraud Action UK says that contactless card fraud is still relatively low — just 3.1p for every £100 spent using the system.There are concerns, though, that your card could be copied remotely, and Which? advises customers to take three easy steps: never lose sight of your card, always ask for a receipt and check your bank statements.If you are a victim, however, the banks will cover your losses.You already can. Apple Pay allows you to use your watch to pay for your cappuccino, while you can swipe your wristband or sticker if you’ve signed up to Barclaycard’s bPay system.Overall, there are a billion contactless cards in use in Europe, by far the most advanced in the world. The UK has the most pay and go cards, followed by France and Poland. MasterCard reported that 77 per cent of all its card transactions made in the Czech Republic were contactless in 2015. Sweden has already talked of becoming a cashless society by 2030.The US lags behind, but Canada is catching up fast, with 75 per cent of leading retailers now accepting contactless payments.Not quite, but there are those who think that cash might have had its day. Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, recently made the case for ditching cash as negative interest rates could theoretically be applied to digital currencies, giving the BoE much more flexibility should we go through another recession.Others link cash payments to crime, the black economy and tax evasion. On the other hand, privacy concerns have been raised if all payments are made digitally. Regardless, both cash and cards look set to remain staples of everyday spending for years to come.
53;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
54;V;Visa Inc;2017-08-28T13:01:55Z;New Fitbit smartwatch and headphones take aim at Apple;Partnership with Adidas marks effort to regain leadership of wearable tech market;Fitbit is teaming up with Adidas as it takes on Apple with its first fully-fledged smartwatch, Ionic, and new wireless headphones. Ionic is the first of what Fitbit chief executive James Park said would be a series of smartwatches, as it looks to regain its position at the top of the wearable technology market, a position that analysts say it has lost to Apple Watch in recent months. The $300 device — which boasts four-day battery life, new wireless music and payment features, and improved GPS and heart-rate tracking — will go on sale in October. Adidas, the German sportswear group, will sell a special edition of Ionic starting early next year, boosting Fitbit’s profile in Europe and Asia. In Fitbit, Adidas has a new ally against Nike, which first partnered with Apple on a customised version of its Watch last year. Adidas lags behind Nike in the US sportswear market but has been gaining share in recent months. Fitbit is banking on Ionic to reverse its declining sales, as simpler fitness trackers reach saturation point in many developed markets. The San Francisco-based company’s revenues this year are expected to fall by as much as a quarter compared with 2016. Ionic’s launch is “definitely a big event in the company’s history”, Mr Park said in an interview. “We’ve rarely entered a new category with this much effort and push behind it.” While the majority of Fitbit’s revenues in the fourth quarter will still come from its earlier products, Mr Park added: “Our entry into smartwatches — and Ionic is not the only product in our smartwatch road map — allows us to re-establish a growth profile for Fitbit looking forward.” [The Ionic’s] upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoeaThe unveiling of Ionic, alongside new Flyer wireless headphones and updated Aria scales, comes ahead of the anticipated new version of the Apple Watch, which is expected to include a cellular wireless connection when it makes its debut next month. Ionic, which unlike an Apple Watch works with both iOS and Android smartphones, features a slimline design that Fitbit says was inspired by the space age. Its upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoea. A colour touchscreen will also offer guided workout sessions, powered by a revamped Fitbit Coach app, and customisable watch faces. Analysts at Gartner estimate that 41.5m smartwatches will be sold globally this year, up 19 per cent from 2016, generating $9.7bn in revenues. The consultancy predicts that smartwatches will be the second best-selling kind of wearable device by 2019, after Bluetooth headsets. Fitbit’s $130 Flyer wireless headphones, which pair automatically with Ionic watches, are designed to be workout friendly with a secure and sweat-proof design. While Flyer headphones, at $130, are cheaper than Apple’s $160 AirPods, the Ionic is at least $30 more expensive than the cheapest available Apple Watch. Gartner estimates the average selling price of a smartwatch is $223. Mr Park believes Ionic can command a premium price because of its four-day battery life (Apple Watch lasts just a day or two), improved GPS reception thanks to “nanomoulding technology” that he says is unique in wearables, and the ability to stream music from Pandora, the internet radio company. Thanks to the acquisitions of Coin and Pebble last year, Fitbit’s watch will also support third-party apps, such as Starbucks and Strava, as well as contactless payments with Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards. Although multi-day battery life means Ionic can track sleep, continuous use of both music and GPS will consume all the device’s power reserves in around 10 hours. Like the Apple Watch, Ionic’s screen remains dark until wearers raise their arm or push a button, in order to lengthen battery life. Customers can order an Ionic starting on August 28, with the first shipments arriving in late September. The device will go on general sale in October.
55;V;Visa Inc;2017-08-18T04:09:45Z;Charlottesville teaches Big Tech a lesson in accountability;Facebook, Google and other groups clamp down on white nationalists;For years now, the big internet groups have insisted that they should not be held responsible for the material their users post. Casting themselves as conduits rather than content providers, Facebook, Google and the gang have argued that intensive monitoring would not only be prohibitively expensive, but also run the risk of curtailing freedom of expression.There is nothing like a violent, racist mob for changing minds.In the wake of last weekend’s white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, the big technology companies — alongside financial services firms — have suddenly discovered that there is more that they can do. After the Daily Stormer published an article making fun of an anti-racism protester who died in the violence, GoDaddy, world’s largest domain registrar, cancelled the site’s web hosting account. When the Daily Stormer tried to move to Google, it followed suit. Now Twitter has deleted several accounts associated with the same site, and cyber security group Cloudflare has stopped providing it with protection from hackers.For their part, Facebook and Reddit have removed several white nationalist groups from their sites. Spotify has pulled tracks by “hate bands” from its music streaming service.Payments groups including MasterCard, Visa and PayPal are also taking new action to block hate groups from receiving money through their websites, and Apple pulled support from white supremacist sites that had been using its online payments service to sell Nazi merchandise. They acted after pressure from activists such Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change. He pointed out that their processing fees were “quite literally profiting off hate and murder”.None of these steps are unprecedented. The financial groups routinely prevent people from using their payments systems for illegal products — online gambling, banned drugs. Social media groups have in recent months stepped up their efforts to spot and remove terrorist and other hate group posts and videos after coming under sharp criticism.But the flurry of activity after the Charlottesville march suggests that the attitudes have shifted sharply in the last few days.Not only have the tech and finance companies taken action to starve hate groups of money and online exposure, but a host of US chief executives quit President Donald Trump’s business councils after he failed to denounce the neo-Nazi and far right violence.Apple’s Tim Cook spelt out his reasoning in a memo to employees: “We must not witness or permit such hate and bigotry and we must be unequivocal about it.”There is a danger. In their rush to distance themselves from violent hate groups, some businesses could end up overreacting. Civil liberties groups are already warning that there is a clear difference between groups that advocate violence and those that are merely deeply unpopular. “Racism and bigotry will not be eradicated if we merely force them underground,” said Anthony Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union.Businesses are well within their rights to stop providing services and exposure to violent hate mongers, whether they are Islamic terrorists or white nationalists. But as Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Prince has already warned, Google and Facebook should not have the last word on who is entitled to free speech.brooke.masters@ft.com
56;V;Visa Inc;2017-08-17T01:28:14Z;US companies crack down on key services for hate groups;Move to halt access to funds adds to Silicon Valley squeeze on internet use;US companies are blocking hate groups from key services such as payments, cyber security defences and social media sites after the violence in Charlottesville, despite questions over the consequences for freedom of speech.Leading payment and credit card groups MasterCard, American Express, Discover Financial Services and Visa have joined Silicon Valley companies Twitter and Cloudflare to become the latest corporations to try to block neo-Nazis’ access to funds and the internet.Several of the payments companies said they did not ban the use of their services because the customers expressed offensive views but because they violated their terms of service or incited violence.Discover said “in light of recent events” it was “terminating merchant agreements with hate groups, given the violence incited by their extremist views”.MasterCard said it was “shutting down the use of our cards on sites that we believe incite violence, as well as those who are wrongfully suggesting they accept our cards, when in fact they don’t”.American Express said it was reviewing websites brought to its attention by activists and would take “appropriate action”.Visa said “a number of” sites it reviewed had engaged in illegal activities or failed to meet issuers’ acceptable-use policies.PayPal has also stopped enabling money transfers to websites that violate its policies by promoting “hate, violence or racial intolerance”.The payments companies had come under pressure from activists such as Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, who said they were “making hundreds of thousands of dollars from processing fees for these racist groups and quite literally profiting off hate and murder”.Apple confirmed on Wednesday that it had pulled support for a handful of white supremacist sites that had been using its online payments service to sell merchandise such as T-shirts and bumper stickers bearing Nazi logos and slogans. Guidelines for Apple Pay state that sites “may not incorporate Apple Pay into a website that promotes hate, violence, or intolerance based on race, age, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation”, while the iPhone’s App Store also prohibits various kinds of “objectionable content”.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, was quick to condemn the weekend’s violence in Charlottesville, tweeting on Monday morning: “We’ve seen the terror of white supremacy & racist violence before. It’s a moral issue — an affront to America. We must all stand against it.”Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, Twitter and Cloudflare have also joined a tech industry effort to block neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer from the internet. The site posted an offensive article about the woman who died in the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.The San Francisco-based messaging platform appeared to have suspended several accounts that are associated with the website, such as @dailystormer and @dailystormers, but did not respond to a request for comment.Cloudflare ended its business with the site, which it protected from distributed denial of service attacks designed to take it offline.Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, said he was also worried about the consequences of the “dangerous” decision he made to drop the site. He was concerned that it could lead to “vigilante justice”, where hackers can launch attacks because no one will protect certain sites, and questioned whether it made his company more vulnerable to a government pressuring them to take down a site.In the end, Mr Prince said he decided to remove the site after a Daily Stormer commenter claimed Cloudflare was “one of us” and he did not want the company to appear to sympathise with readers of the neo-Nazi site. “We could not remain neutral after these claims of secret support by Cloudflare,” he said in a blog post.The tech companies follow GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar, which removed the site. The Daily Stormer then tried to switch to Google Domains but Google said it would not host the site because it represented an “incitement to violence”. The Daily Stormer then transferred to a Russian domain name, but that can no longer be reached, probably because it is no longer protected from hackers attempting to take it offline.Facebook and Reddit have removed several white nationalist groups, while Spotify, the music streaming service, said it had removed tracks by “hate bands” as classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center.But some believe tech companies are overstepping their role by effectively banning sites from the internet.Nate Cardozo, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit defending digital privacy and free speech online, said there is a difference between Facebook deciding content violates its policies in its walled garden, and infrastructure providers “pulling the plug”.“If an internet service provider wants to deny me the opportunity to read offensive speech like the Daily Stormer, that’s a problem,” he said. “There doesn’t seem to be any suggestion the Daily Stormer was hosting illegal content, just terrible content. We should be able to see it and reject it.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in Los Angeles
57;V;Visa Inc;2017-08-16T11:08:42Z;Priceline: tripping up;The online travel agent may have to settle for lower growth;"Ageing disrupters always like to pretend they still have plenty of room for expansion. So MasterCard would rather talk about the continued opportunity to replace cash than its gnarlier war with Visa or newer payments companies.Priceline, for its part, defines its battlefield as the “global accommodation business” where it has only a “single-digit market share”. Even at the age of 20, the online travel agent sees plenty of room to grow.The spin is undermined by the slowdown which Priceline predicts. Its third-quarter earnings forecast last week sent the stock down 7 per cent. Room nights booked should increase 11-16 per cent year-on-year, Priceline said, a sharp deceleration from the 21 per cent growth in the second quarter. That was its lowest growth on record.Analysts hope Priceline is lowballing. At least three of them deemed its forecast “conservative”. Understandable, given that the company has beaten its revenue guidance in every quarter bar one over 10 years, according to Bloomberg. But beware the extent of its conservatism: the average beat is only 4 per cent.So the business is slowing. It could simply ramp up marketing spending. Priceline is holding back, in part because it is seeing costs per click increase in some channels. This is surprising given Google’s decline in CPCs; TripAdvisor, another travel portal has also reported lower CPCs.If Priceline cannot spend effectively, for whatever reason, settling for lower growth is acceptable. Its market share, especially with its successful European business Booking.com, is still strong, easily leading Expedia at the top of the online travel market. It enjoys the margins of a mature business, 35 per cent at the operating level, and could go higher. Unfortunately, its $85bn enterprise value needs support from a fast-growing business. The management has clearly signalled that no longer exists."
58;V;Visa Inc;2017-08-11T06:38:54Z;Nationwide profit growth slips on slowing buy-to-let market;;British building society Nationwide reported falling profits as it stepped back from buy-to-let mortgages amid a backdrop of declining UK house prices.The group’s pre-tax profit for the three months to June was £322m, down from £401m the same time last year. Nationwide lent out £2.4bn to mortgage borrowers in the quarter on a net basis, down from £3.5bn in the second quarter of 2016.This was down to a “reduction in BTL advances,” the group said. This was partly because it changed its underwriting criteria for buy-to-let mortgages. This market has also slowed in the UK because of tax changes that make it more expensive for landlords to flip buy-to-let properties.The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said this week that a fall in house prices has fanned out from London to other parts of the UK as political uncertainty and tax changes continue to weigh on the top end of the housing market.Nationwide has also been growing its business providing higher-interest current accounts to consumers who are starved of options to earn income on their savings. Nationwide ended 2016 as the highest net gainer of current accounts from people who switched banks.Chief executive Joe Garner also showed some concerns about Brexit. He said:It will be important for lenders to balance carefully credit supply with affordability as we seek to support the long-term interests of consumers in a responsible way through any potential economic slowdown ahead.UK consumer spending fell in July for the third month in a row, according to an analysis of Visa card payment records.The building society’s net interest margin was stable at 1.35 per cent, while loans and advances to customers remained broadly flat at £189.5bn.
59;V;Visa Inc;2017-08-06T23:03:06Z;UK consumer spending squeezed for third month in a row;Data from Visa payments suggest sharp fall in purchases of clothing and homewares;UK consumer spending fell in July for the third consecutive month, the longest contraction in more than four years, according to an analysis of Visa card payment records.The unofficial figures suggest that stagnant wages and rising prices have bitten into household budgets, and provide further evidence that Britain has failed to regain economic momentum after a slowdown in growth at the start of the year.Visa estimates that consumers spent 0.8 per cent less last month than in July 2016, after adjusting for inflation. They cut back especially sharply on discretionary purchases such as clothing and homewares, which registered declines of 4 per cent and 5.2 per cent.“The figure provides further evidence that rising prices and stagnant wage growth are squeezing consumers’ pockets,” said Kevin Jenkins, Visa’s UK and Ireland managing director.The data are based on records from Visa debit and credit cards, which are used in one-third of all consumer spending in the UK.They point to a weakening of consumer demand since the first quarter, when the most recent official figures show that spending was 2.6 per cent higher in real terms than in the same period the previous year.A decline in household consumption, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of the economy, would exacerbate the fragility of the UK’s economic outlook.The Office for National Statistics estimates that year-on-year growth slowed to 1.7 per cent in the three months to June, from 2 per cent in the first quarter.Over the past decade, Visa’s index has generally provided a good guide to the broad trends in the official data, although the monthly data can sometimes throw up misleading signals.To take account of changing patterns of card use, Visa and IHS Markit remove transactions such as tax payments, which do not relate to consumer spending, and factor in the growing number of transactions that are made using debit cards.The survey seeks to take account of inflation by adjusting the index by the consumer price index, although the method is imperfect as the inflation rate for July has not been published yet.
60;V;Visa Inc;2017-07-21T20:35:23Z;Visa rallies after benefiting from economic tailwinds;Nasdaq snaps its longest winning streak since February 2015;Visa shares were stronger on Friday after the payments network unveiled larger than expected rises to its quarterly profits and revenues, which were bolstered by its purchase of Visa Europe as well as robust growth in payments volume.The California-based company said operating revenue jumped 26 per cent in its fiscal third quarter, which ended in June, to $4.57bn. Net profits rose to $2.06bn, or 86 cents a share, from $412m, or 17 cents a share.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings per share of 81 cents on revenues of $4.36bn. The shares rose 1.5 per cent to $99.60, extending its year-to-date rise to 27.6 per cent.Profits in the previous year’s quarter were weighed down by several one-time items related to the purchase of Visa Europe, which it closed last June. Excluding those factors, net income would have been up 26 per cent on a year-over-year basis, Visa said.Visa’s upbeat performance was “powered by economic tailwinds in the US and globally”, said Alfred Kelly Jr, chief executive.The gains came as payments volume growth clocked in at 38 per cent to $1.9tn in the three months ending June 30.Cross-border volumes — the result of transactions in which the credit card issuer is located in a different country than the merchant — rose 11 per cent when the Europe operations are included in the previous year’s results.“After a brief period of disappointment with the Visa Europe acquisition, investors finally received the positive revisions they were hoping for this quarter,” said Bill Carcache, an analyst at Nomura.Elsewhere, Cintas was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after the maker of work uniforms issued full-year fiscal 2018 earnings outlook that topped Wall Street estimates. Shares in the company climbed 9.2 per cent to $138.43.The rally in Cintas and Visa shares accompanied a nearly flat day of trading in US stocks.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were almost unchanged at 2,472.54 and 6,387.75, respectively, with the Nasdaq snapping its longest winning streak since February 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.2 per cent lower at 21,580.07.Meanwhile, shares in Ebay fell 1.5 per cent to $36.61 after the online marketplace issued an earnings outlook that disappointed markets.The San Jose-based company said it expected earnings from continuing operations to range between 30 and 32 cents a share in the current quarter, compared with analysts’ expectations of 33 cents. Its adjusted earnings outlook of 46 to 48 cents missed expectations of 49 cents.Moreover, it lowered its outlook for full-year earnings to $1.65 to $1.75 a share, below its previous projections for EPS in the range of $1.85-$2.10.Alongside the downbeat outlook, the company reported a sharp drop in second-quarter earnings.On a per-share basis, earnings slid 95 per cent to 2 cents from 38 cents in the year-ago period. The results were affected by a $311m charge tied to the realignment of its legal structure.However, adjusting for one-time items, EPS of 45 cents were up 5 per cent and in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenues rose 4 per cent to $2.3bn, in line with estimates.

Net profits rose to $2.06bn, or 86 cents a share, from $412m, or 17 cents a share.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings per share of 81 cents on revenues of $4.36bn. The shares climbed 1.3 per cent in extended trading, which would add to a 2017 rally of 25.6 per cent.Profits in the previous year’s quarter were weighed down by several one-time items related to the purchase of Visa Europe, which it closed last June. Excluding those factors, net income would have been up 26 per cent on a year-over-year basis, Visa said.The gains came as payments volume growth clocked in at 38 per cent to $1.9tn in the three months ending June 30.

62;V;Visa Inc;2017-07-18T06:00:56Z;PayPal in deal with Visa to offer debit cards in Europe;Online payments group takes another step into world of traditional retail banking;PayPal has struck a deal with Visa that enables it to issue debit cards in Europe, as the online payments service company moves further into traditional retail banking territory.The two companies have signed an agreement to collaborate in offering payments services across the continent, assuaging a longstanding competitive tension.Card companies have come under pressure from the rise of PayPal, whose users are able to make payments directly from bank accounts, bypassing the card network.As part of the deal, PayPal, which already has a banking licence in Europe, will be able to offer PayPal-branded Visa debit cards.The move is expected to appeal in particular to small businesses that carry balances in their PayPal account for buying supplies, or for people who do not have a bank account but use PayPal.Until now, PayPal has used its banking licence largely for treasury functions. The deal with Visa opens up a broader customer base as the company shifts towards retail banking.Jim Magats, head of payments, product and engineering at PayPal, said that although there was no immediate goal to launch a debit card, planning was under way.PayPal already offers pre-paid cards with MasterCard in some countries, such as Italy. It also offers debit cards in the US. The move would mark a first in Europe.Mr Magats said that PayPal had several merchant customers that would prefer to use PayPal rather than a bank account for day-to-day spending, and customers who conducted all their online transactions via PayPal who wanted to extend this to card spending.The deal with Visa will give PayPal users access to Visa’s contactless payment points in retailers and shops across Europe, providing PayPal with access to in-store retail transactions. It also means that customers would be able to use their phone to “tap and pay” in a shop, for example, through their PayPal account.The development is a boost for PayPal, which has traditionally operated online as a payments service, by deepening its foothold in the world of in-store commerce.For Visa, the deal makes it easier for PayPal customers to pay with their Visa card online or in a mobile app.Mr Magats said that PayPal had “historically created friction for a customer to get to their Visa card if they had a balance or a bank account . . . we will create an equal environment for someone to get to their Visa account”.The move should mean that Visa sees more card transactions going through PayPal. In return, Visa will pay “economic incentives”.Bill Gajda, head of innovation and strategic partnerships at Visa, said: “PayPal is a really important piece of our broader strategy in enabling digital payments.”The agreement is an extension of a tie-up between the companies in the US and Asia-Pacific last year. Mr Magats added that the partnership was likely to be “the first of many” in Europe.
63;V;Visa Inc;2017-07-17T17:19:17Z;BNY Mellon taps former Visa chief to head bank;Charles Scharf led credit card group through digital push;BNY Mellon has appointed the banker who led a digital push at Visa to put the 230-year-old institution that has come under pressure from activist investors through a technology-driven shake-up.Newly appointed chief executive, Charles Scharf, who is also a Microsoft director, said he would bring a “fresh set of eyes every day” to BNY, where he is replacing Gerald Hassell, a 44 year company veteran.Mr Scharf — a JPMorgan Chase veteran who left Visa in December because family reasons made it “difficult” for him to spend enough time in California where the payments company is based — is joining BNY, which is based in Manhattan, with immediate effect. BNY, which maintains records, tracks performance and lends securities for institutional investors, had been encouraged by activist investors to do more to deal with the profit-dampening impact of persistently low interest rates.However, Mr Hassell said on Monday that there had been “no undue influence” from the activists. Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners won a board seat in 2014 and, according to S&P Capital IQ data, is BNY’s eighth biggest shareholder.“Technology is changing almost any industry across the world today — anyone who doesn’t think so hasn’t caught up with reality,” Mr Scharf said. “It’s certainly true for this company.”“There’s even more opportunity to use technology in different ways — for incumbents and newcomers,” he addedThe rapid change of leadership and the bank’s decision to choose an external candidate surprised some Wall Street analysts. Gerard Cassidy, at RBC Capital Markets, said he thought that chief financial officer Todd Gibbons or a head of one of the bank’s business lines “could have replaced Mr Hassell”.However, Mr Hassell, who turns 66 in October and has been chief executive since 2011, said: “It all sort of came together in the right way at the right time. There was no timeline pressure associated with it.”He added: “We have some truly outstanding people internally who are going to complement Charlie, and Charlie is going to complement them.”Before his four years at the helm of Visa, Mr Scharf was head of JPMorgan Chase’s retail financial services and served as managing director of One Equity Partners, the bank’s private investment arm.Asked about the possibility of acquisitions and disposals, Mr Scharf said he was not arriving at BNY with “any preconceived notion that something [a part of the business] needs to go, or that we need to do something else”. He added, however, that BNY should “continue to not rest on the past”.Analysts at KBW said that while the appointment was a positive, it was challenging to see “where Mr Scharf can accelerate growth relative to the growth prospects that were available to Gerald Hassell”.Last month, the bank brought in a new chief information officer, Bridget Engle, from Bank of America.Mr Hassell is staying on at BNY as chairman until the end of the year, after which Mr Scharf will hold both senior positions. Korn Ferry, the executive search firm, led the hunt for his successor.BNY shares were up 2 per cent in lunchtime trading in New York.

He will be replacing 65-year old Gerald Hassell, who is retiring but will continue to serve as chairman of the board until the end of the year. After that, Mr Scharf will also assume the role of board chairman.“Today’s announcement is the culmination of the Board of Directors’ robust and long-term succession planning process,” said Mr Hassell. “Charlie is an accomplished and distinguished leader, with a record of profitably growing businesses, driving innovation and managing complex, large-scale global financial services organizations.”Mr Scharf, 52, was most recently chief executive of Visa and prior to that has done stints at JPMorgan Chase, first as head of the bank’s retail financial services and later as managing director of One Equity Partners, the bank’s private investment arm.“Under Charlie’s leadership, Visa transformed its technology platform by opening access to its network and capabilities, partnered with the world’s leading technology companies to drive new payment experiences, introduced new technologies to improve payment system security and built a world-class management team,” added Mr Hassell. “Charlie is ideally suited to lead BNY Mellon through the next phase of growth.”Mr Hassell became BNY Mellon’s CEO in August 2011. Under his tenure, shares in the company have more than doubled from $25 a share to a record high of $52.50 last Friday, giving it a market value of $54.8bn.The stock added another 2.4 per cent in pre-market trading on Monday on news of Mr Scharf’s appointment.
65;V;Visa Inc;2017-07-09T23:01:28Z;UK consumer spending falls at steepest rate in four years;Shoppers stick to essentials as households feel squeeze;Consumer spending in the UK contracted at the steepest rate for four years in the second quarter of 2017, according to a report published on Monday by Visa, the payments provider.Visa estimated that household spending was 0.3 per cent lower in the three months to June 30 compared to the same period in 2016, after taking inflation into account — the biggest year-on-year contraction since the third quarter of 2013.Meanwhile, a survey released by accounting firm Deloitte said business confidence has fallen following the June general election, in a finding that suggests the anticipated slowdown in consumer spending may not be offset by increased investment by companies.The economy fared much better than many economists predicted after the vote to leave the EU last year, mainly because consumer spending held up.But with inflation rising partly because of the fall in sterling’s value after the Brexit vote, and employers resisting significant pay increases, household budgets are being squeezed.“It’s clear that inflation is beginning to affect shopping habits . . . with consumers diverting their spending to essentials,” said Kevin Jenkins, managing director for the UK and Ireland at Visa.He highlighted how household spending on recreation and culture dropped in June, the first such fall in almost four years.Consumers also cut back on big ticket furniture items last month. “The recent heatwave and summer sales have failed to reverse the high street’s fortunes, with face-to-face spend falling for the second consecutive month,” said Mr Jenkins.The downbeat data may add to calls for the Bank of England to keep interest rates lower for longerThe weak economic growth of 0.2 per cent in the first quarter — the worst performance by a G7 country — was blamed on rising prices and falling consumer spending.Visa’s figures add to a run of negative economic data that suggest that the economy has struggled to regain momentum in the second quarter.Annabel Fiddes, economist at IHS Markit, which produces the data with Visa, said: “The downbeat data may add to calls for the Bank of England to keep interest rates lower for longer, as weaker consumer spending is likely to weigh on economic growth in the months ahead.”Meanwhile, optimism among chief financial officers has declined and concerns about the impact of Brexit have risen, according to the Deloitte survey of finance directors at 122 FTSE 350 companies conducted shortly after the election.The proportion of chief financial officers saying they are less optimistic about their companies’ prospects than they were three months ago has increased to 42 per cent, up from 17 per cent in the first quarter, the survey found.Some finance directors said they were increasingly focused on using their balance sheets defensively.“Business sentiment has been on a rollercoaster in the last 18 months, slumping in the aftermath of the [EU] referendum, staging a strong recovery and then falling again in the wake of the general election,” said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte.To take account of changing patterns of credit and debit card use, Visa and IHS Markit remove transactions that are not related to consumer spending, such as tax payments, among other things.The survey seeks to take account of inflation by adjusting Visa’s data by the consumer price index, although the method is imperfect as the inflation rate for June has not been published yet.
66;V;Visa Inc;2017-06-27T16:27:52Z;Klarna/Visa: pay pals;Swedish ecommerce start-up chases US and UK exposure with newly minted banking licence;The imposing façades that banks use to reassure customers of their stability are hard to replicate online. Installing the virtual equivalent slows down and frustrates shoppers. Klarna’s solution of removing it altogether has made the Swedish e-commerce company one of Europe’s most highly valued start-ups.Sixty million people already use the service, mostly in mainland Europe. With a newly minted banking license and Visa secured as an investor, Klarna is hoping to ramp up US and UK exposure. If successful, it will reap the rewards of a global leap in online shopping. Market research company Statista expects online retail sales to rise from 7 per cent of the total to 13 per cent by 2019.Klarna’s sales pitch is based on easy access to goods and credit. Shoppers using Klarna-affiliated stores need only provide an email address and postcode. If it deems them creditworthy, they can pay after they receive the goods.Whether the startup warrants its most recent valuation of $2.25bn, more than five times last year’s revenue, depends on how well it deals with increased competition and fraud risk as it grows. Payment services in the US and UK are more crowded fields than Germany and Sweden, with Amazon Pay, PayPal, Stripe and Square already jostling for attention with banks.Klarna’s oft-repeated ambition to be the Ryanair of banking is a good start. There is a reason why shares in Ryanair trade at a premium to the wider airline industry — the low-cost model keeps the group profitable even when flight sales dip. Unusually for a tech start-up, Klarna makes money too, with an operating margin of 14 per cent on SKr992m ($114m) first-quarter sales.This revenue relies heavily on consumer lending, which relies on credit history and transaction data to determine risk. Midnight purchases of multiple TVs, for example, ring alarm bells. Klarna says its has a low fraud rate of 3.7 basis points, but this data is from 2014. As it grows, Klarna will need to provide more evidence that it can balance expansion with security.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
67;V;Visa Inc;2017-06-27T12:41:05Z;Visa buys stake in fast-growing fintech group Klarna;Swedish company is increasing its presence in online payments;Visa is taking a stake in Klarna in a sign of the Swedish fintech’s growing presence in online payments.A week after Klarna became the largest European fintech to receive a banking licence, Visa said it was making a strategic investment through the purchase of a stake of less than 10 per cent as well as offering a future partnership. The price paid by Visa was not revealed.Klarna has become a big participant in Germany and the Nordics for online payments, allowing its 60m customers to buy goods on the internet quickly and pay only after receiving them. It is looking to make a similar splash in the UK and US as well as use its banking licence to offer customers cards and salary accounts.Visa said its investment in Klarna — last valued at $2.25bn in 2015 — was “part of a global strategy to open up the Visa ecosystem and support a broad range of new partners”.“Klarna has demonstrated an expertise in consumer credit and online purchasing and together, we share a vision for how today’s online and mobile commerce experiences can be as simple as they are in the real world,” said Jim McCarthy, Visa’s head of innovation and strategic partnerships.The deal with Klarna is the first in Europe since Visa completed its €13bn takeover of Visa Europe last year. Visa said it was committed to finding more partnerships in online payments on the continent.It follows several similar deals in the US where Visa has taken stakes in both Square and Stripe, highly- valued payments start-ups.Klarna has several shareholders including venture capital groups such as General Atlantic and Creandum. Its last big investment came earlier this month when Anders Povlsen, the owner of fashion group Bestseller, bought a stake of more than 10 per cent in the company.“The real beauty of this partnership between Klarna and Visa will be leveraging our joint technological capabilities, so working together to explore possibilities on solutions with virtual issuing, digital credentials and biometric authentication,” Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “This is about continually developing smooth and seamless shopping experiences across channels for our merchants and customers.”The Klarna boss told the Financial Times last week that the group was resisting the urge to go public. He conceded that it might happen “at some point of time” but added he still saw a lot of growth ahead for Klarna. The company processed €13bn of payments in 2016, a 44 per cent increase on the previous year, giving SKr3.6bn in revenues for Klarna and operating profits of SKr113m.
68;V;Visa Inc;2017-06-11T23:01:49Z;First fall in consumer spending for almost 4 years;Visa highlights squeeze on households as prices rise and wage growth stalls;Consumer spending has fallen on an annual basis for the first time in almost four years, as higher prices tighten their squeeze on British households, according to a report by Visa, the payments provider.Adjusting for inflation, real consumer spending by British consumers on Visa debit, credit and prepaid cards in May was 0.8 per cent lower than in the same month last year. Visa said that seasonally adjusted spending was 1.8 per cent lower in May compared to April.The data are based on a survey of one-third of money spent on Visa debit, credit or prepayment cards in Britain, which are used in almost 10bn transactions every year.The figures are unofficial, but suggest that sluggish economic growth continued in the second quarter, after a first quarter in which the UK grew at the slowest rate in the G7.Official data showed that in the first three months of 2017, the economy grew only 0.2 per cent, with consumer spending up 0.3 per cent on the previous quarter. On an annual basis, real consumer spending was 2.6 per cent higher in the first quarter than in the same period the previous year.But if Visa’s figures provide a reliable indicator of the forthcoming official data for the second quarter, they suggest there will be an additional weakening in household consumption, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of the economy. Over the past decade, Visa’s index has generally provided a good guide to the broad trends in the official data, although the monthly data can sometimes provide misleading signals. Recent weakness in official data and in business surveys has led economists to scale back expectations of a recovery in growth in the second quarter. On Friday, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that growth in the three months to the end of May had been only 0.2 per cent, the same as in the first quarter.Visa said that the year-on-year decline in spending was greater on the high street than online, with sales of clothing and household goods hit particularly hard. In contrast, spending on restaurants, bars and recreation all had healthy annual increases in spending.Kevin Jenkins, UK managing director at Visa, said: “Our index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze.”Annabel Fiddes, an economist at IHS Markit, which produces the data with Visa, warned that the squeeze resulting from prices rising faster than incomes was likely to intensify as inflation continues to rise in the second half of the year.“The outlook for consumer spending continues to look relatively bleak, with households facing faster increases in living costs and muted wage growth,” she said.The latest official data showed inflation hit its highest level in four years during April, with consumer prices 2.7 per cent higher than in the same month in 2016.To take account of changing patterns of card use, Visa and IHS Markit remove transactions that are not related to consumer spending, such as tax payments, and also adjust the data to factor in the growing number of transactions that are made using debit cards. The survey seeks to take account of inflation by adjusting the index by the consumer price index, although the method is imperfect as the inflation rate for May has not been published yet.
69;V;Visa Inc;2017-04-20T20:25:14Z;Visa climbs after posting quarterly beat;;Visa on Thursday revealed upbeat quarterly profit and sales figures, as the credit card processor saw transaction volume rise.The group’s operating revenues increased 23 per cent year-on-year to $4.5bn in the quarter to the end of March, helped by the inclusion of Visa Europe, which it acquired last June, as well as growth in payments and transactions volume.Net earnings tumbled 75 per cent to $430m, or 18 cents a share, due to charges from reorganising the Visa Europe unit to align the company’s overall corporate structure. Excluding special items, earnings rose 27 per cent to $2.1bn, or 86 cents a share.Wall Street analysts had forecast profits of 79 cents a share on revenues of $4.28bn.Visa’s shares climbed 2.1 per cent in extended trading, which would add to a rise of 12 per cent over the last 12 months as of Thursday’s close.“In the face of geopolitical uncertainty, Visa continues to execute well against our operating plan and strategic priorities, delivering sustained growth across nearly every part of our business,” said Alfred Kelly, Jr., chief executive. “Robust growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions drove better than expected results”.Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was up 37 per cent year-on-year to $1.7tn, while total processed transactions rose 42 per cent to 26.3bn. If Visa Europe were included in the prior year’s results, transactions would have been up 12 per cent.The strong payment growth at Visa echoes American Express, which revealed quarterly results on Wednesday that surpassed expectations, helped by stronger member spending.Visa’s board also authorised a new $5bn share buyback programme.
70;V;Visa Inc;2017-02-02T21:20:39Z;Visa shares climb as quarterly earnings top estimates;;Visa shares climbed in after-hours trading on Thursday after the credit-card processing network unveiled a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profits.The California-based company logged earnings of $2.1bn, or 86 cents a share, in the three-month period ending on December 31 — an increase of 7 per cent from the previous year for both metrics. The EPS topped Wall Street expectations of 78 cents.Operating revenue climbed by 25 per cent on the same basis to $4.5bn, also exceeding forecasts of $4.3bn.The upbeat results in Visa’s fiscal first quarter propelled the stock higher by more than 2 per cent in extended trading. That would add to an advance of 5.5 per cent for 2017 as of the close of trading on Thursday.“Visa’s fiscal 2017 is off to a terrific start with a strong first quarter of revenue and earnings growth driven by accelerating growth in payments volume, cross-border commerce and processed transactions in virtually all regions around the world,” said Alfred Kelly, chief executive.
71;V;Visa Inc;2016-12-05T13:13:28Z;Bank card groups to lose China market share;Lenders halt orders for plastic bearing logos of foreign issuers;The world’s largest bank card companies are set to lose a share of China’s $8tn payment card market as they scramble to build their own clearing businesses.China’s banks have halted all orders for co-branded credit cards bearing the logos of foreign card issuers such as Visa and MasterCard, according to Goldpac Group, a Hong Kong-listed company that manufactures about 30 per cent of credit cards for the Chinese market.The move followed a notice from the People’s Bank of China that told banks not to renew the cards, Goldpac confirmed.The co-branded cards, which sport foreign company logos alongside that of state payment clearing monopoly Unionpay, have been a trademark of China’s tight control over its capital account and payments made in renminbi. While the cards allowed foreign groups to process US-dollar denominated payments for Chinese customers travelling overseas, Unionpay has kept a firm hold on domestic currency clearing for card payments.Both parties had benefited by splitting the fees from international transactions, especially during the early days of the arrangement when foreign companies had little exposure to China, and Unionpay was not widely accepted abroad. Since then, the Chinese company has built an extensive network overseas, reducing the need for Chinese customers to carry foreign cards.About 240m co-branded credit cards have been issued by Chinese banks during the past 14 years, according to data from Goldpac. The cards — which forced competitors to share space on the same piece of plastic — have seen Visa and Unionpay clash over which company processes the payments.The end of the unique Chinese payment product comes just months after the central bank and securities regulator said foreign card companies could apply for licences to clear domestic Chinese payments.The process of setting up those operations is expected to take at least a year to complete and faces regulatory challenges, experts say. In the interim, foreign card companies will lose customers as the co-branded cards expire without the opportunity for renewal.“The foreign companies will be affected by this . . . There will be a period where they cannot expand that business,” said David Lu, chairman of Goldpac, noting that the impact could be limited if foreign companies set up their businesses quickly.Customers looking to renew expired cards will now be issued two separate cards from the same bank, one serviced by Unionpay, the other by the foreign company.Visa declined to comment on the specifics of the situation but said that it “will comply with all government regulations”. MasterCard and Unionpay did not immediately respond to inquiries on the matter.The decision to allow global payments operators to set up domestic clearing operations was a breakthrough in the market following years of complaints from the US that China discriminated against foreign payment companies. In 2012, the World Trade Organisation ruled in favour of the US and mandated that China open the market over a period of time.The central bank has said that about $8tn worth of card payment transactions were processed last year, making the market one of the world’s largest.The time required for companies such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express to set up new businesses was unclear but experts expected the groups to face challenges.The regulator has 90 days to approve applications for bank card licences from foreign companies, according to a notice issued in June. After receiving approval, the company has a year to launch the business and must also pass a series of reviews on internet technology and security systems.Those checks are already proving difficult for the companies that have made it to that stage, according to Zennon Kapron, a payments specialist and director at Shanghai-based consultancy Kapronasia.“I get the impression that the actual licences to operate aren’t terribly difficult to get, but getting the final approval to start operations is, as there are all these checks,” Mr Kapron said. “At this point, I would expect the earliest we would see a mainland issued [foreign] card would be late 2017, early 2018.”
72;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Visa revenues climb 19% on higher volumes, Europe inclusion;;Visa said its revenues jumped during its last fiscal quarter, benefiting from its purchase of Visa Europe and higher payment volumes.The group said that its net operating revenue rose by 19 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $4.26bn in the three months to the end of September, meeting Wall Street estimates. Net income climbed 28 per cent to $1.9bn. Adjusting for certain items, profits of 78 cents a share exceeded analyst projections by five cents.Visa attributed the rise in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to the inclusion of Visa Europe, a deal which closed in late June, as well as growth in payments volume and transactions processed.“As we enter fiscal 2017, we are positioned well as revenue headwinds will continue to ease, we will continue to see the benefits from Visa Europe in our results, and our strong client franchise continues to grow,” said chief executive Charlie Scharf.The earnings announcement comes just a week after Mr Scharf unveiled plans to step down as the group’s chief executive. Alfred Kelly, a former president at rival American Express, will take the California-based company’s helm as of December 1.Visa said that it logged payment volumes, excluding Visa Europe, of $1.3tn in the three-month period, up 10 per cent on a constant dollar basis.Meanwhile, operating expenses swelled by 27 per cent to $1.6bn amid costs for the inclusion of Visa Europe and increases in personnel expenses.Visa’s shares were little changed in extended trading. They were up by 7.3 per cent for 2016 as of Monday’s close.
73;V;Visa Inc;2016-10-17T20:52:47Z;Visa CEO cites San Francisco as reason for exit;;"After four years at the helm of Visa, chief executive Charles Scharf said on Monday he will step down in December as “running a San Francisco based company just doesn’t work for me personally right now and wouldn’t be fair to Visa.”Speaking to the FT, Mr Scharf said that much as he “loved” the job in San Francisco, personal circumstances related to his family make it “difficult” for him to spend time there, and on the road, write Ben McLannahan and Jessica Dye in New York.Mr Scharf’s two daughters, parents and extended family are all on the East Coast.He said he notified the board in the middle of last month that he’d been seriously thinking about moving back to New York.During his tenure, Mr Scharf helped Visa transition to a “technology-driven digital commerce company and had led a strategy that will benefit this company for years to come,” said Visa independent chairman Robert Matschullat in a statement. The company posted operating income of $9.1bn in the last fiscal year, according to Visa.Mr Scharf, who joined in 2012 from JP Morgan Chase, will be replaced by Alfred Kelly Jr, former longtime executive at of rival card company American Express. Visa said Mr Scharf will stay on as an advisor to his successor for several months after he steps down as CEO.Mr Kelly is currently a board member of Visa, and in February was named chief executive and president at Intersection, a technology and media company that, among other projects, has spearheaded the launch of free wireless internet in New York City.“We’re lucky to have had the best candidate of anyone out there, someone with 22 or 23 years of payments experience, and who was also very knowledgeable about Visa,” he said, referring to Mr Kelly.Mr Scharf, 51, declined to comment on his long-term plans, beyond the relocation.“I don’t know what I want to do,” he said. “My first commitment is to do what is right for my family; my second commitment is to Visa, to make the transition as smooth as possible.”Visa shares were down about 2 per cent in after-hours trading following the announcement."
74;V;Visa Inc;2016-09-14T13:46:26Z;Visa plots Kenyan payments rival to Mpesa;Mobile service allows people to send money and pay for goods;Visa has partnered with four banks in Kenya to launch a mobile phone payments platform that will mount the first credible challenge to the country’s dominant Mpesa system.The mVisa service allows people to send money to each other’s accounts without first loading a digital wallet, as well as pay for goods and services without a point of sale machine regardless of which mobile provider is being used.Visa, the world’s largest payment company, said mVisa should reduce the cost of remittances from overseas and, for businesses, automatically build up a library of transactions that will help banks provide services such as loans. Kenya is one of the most attractive markets for mobile money because of the success of Mpesa, launched by Safaricom, which is 40 per cent owned by Vodafone, nine years ago.The total value of Mpesa transactions in Safaricom’s last financial year was $52bn and the company’s earnings from the service in 2015/16 was more than $400m.Visa expects the system to be cheaper than Mpesa because people will not be charged when they make payments to merchants, which in turn will be charged less than they currently pay to receive Mpesa payments.Unlike Mpesa, customers will not be charged to convert money received to cash since they can withdraw it from an ATM. Francis Mugane, the director of merchant sales and services for Visa in sub-Saharan Africa, said the aim of the service was to offer an alternative that was convenient and cheap. Kenya is the second country in which mVisa has been rolled out after India last year.“The primary goal is to enable businesses and individuals to make digital payments directly from your bank account and on a system that’s interoperable between banks and mobile networks.” Visa’s partners include Kenya Commercial Bank, Kenya’s largest bank by assets, and two other prominent institutions, the Co-operative Bank and NIC.Visa said it hopes to sign up another eight banks in the next year and expand into neighbouring Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda, which all have well developed mobile money markets, by the end of 2016. It is also exploring a partnership in Nigeria.Eric Musau, an analyst with Standard Investment Bank, described mVisa as “a very good proposition” that could mount a challenge to Mpesa.“It’s the first workable solution to challenge Mpesa and it’s up and running,” he said. “They’re not going to be a threat overnight but I expect them to give Safaricom a run for their money.” However, the new system faces an uphill task in drawing customers away from Mpesa, which has been a runaway success for making payments and transferring money over a mobile phone in a country where many people lack a bank account.mVisa is largely aimed at people with bank accounts, although prepaid cards are available. Mpesa users, in contrast, only need a mobile phone. Mobile phone penetration in Kenya is almost 90 per cent, while the number of people with bank accounts is less than half that. While mVisa has signed up 1,500 merchants, there are 30 times that number of merchants who accept Mpesa.Building up a large network of banks and merchants will be key to attracting customers, said Mr Musau, adding that Safaricom also had the advantage of being able to control its charges while mVisa’s fees are set by the banks.Mr Musau said that Safaricom, which has been developing a payment card of its own over the past year, was likely to fight back. “They’re not going to take this lying down,” he said. Safaricom has already begun testing a payment card linked to Mpesa accounts to grow its transaction business, although it said on Wednesday it did not yet have a date for when it would roll out its cards.Stephen Chege, director of corporate affairs at Safaricom, said: “We are still in a pilot phase for the card after which we shall decide whether to roll it out commercially.”
75;V;Visa Inc;2016-09-07T15:52:47Z;JPMorgan promotes 2 execs to run equities unit;;JPMorgan Chase has replaced its former head of equities, Tim Throsby, with two internal promotions.In a memo to staff on Wednesday, the bank announced that Mark Leung, head of the bank’s fast-growing Asia Pacific equities business since 2014, and Jason Sippel, global head of prime services, would run the global equities division, writes Ben McLannahan in New York.The move comes two days after Mr Throsby left to run Barclays’ corporate and international division, which includes the investment bank. The 50 year-old executive is filling a souped-up version of the role vacated by Tom King, who clashed with former chief executive Anthony Jenkins over the future of the investment bank.“Mark and Jason’s careers at JP Morgan underscore once again the deep bench of talent we have in the CIB,” wrote Daniel Pinto, London-based head of the corporate and investment banking unit, in a memo to staff.JPMorgan, where Jamie Dimon is in his eleventh year as chairman and chief executive, has been a rich source of talent for other banks seeking to boost their leadership teams in recent years.Former JPMorgan executives now in prominent roles elsewhere include Frank Bisignano at First Data, Mike Cavanagh at Comcast, Charlie Scharf at Visa, Bill Winters at Standard Chartered and Scott Powell at Santander Holdings USA. Mr’s Throsby’s new boss at Barclays, Jes Staley, is another JPMorgan alumnus.JPMorgan, long ranked as the top bank in fixed-income sales and trading, has been on a drive to bolster its position in equities, where it ranked as low as eighth in 2010. Last year it gained 90 basis points of market share, according to a presentation in February, remaining in sixth position overall. In derivatives and convertibles it ranks higher, in second, according to Coalition data.“We are positioned incredibly well and yet, we still see more opportunities for us to invest and grow,” said Mr Pinto, in the memo.
76;V;Visa Inc;2016-09-01T04:34:52Z;Visa eyes new link in blockchain payments;Credit card company invites lenders to test interbank transfer system based on bitcoin technology;Visa will take its first step towards disrupting the market for payments between banks on Thursday by inviting lenders to test a system for sending money over blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin.The credit card company, which has been investigating blockchain’s potential for 18 months, has teamed up with BTL Group, a digital payments start-up, to adapt its technology for processing interbank payments.Visa’s move underlines how many of the biggest financial services companies have switched in the past two years from once viewing bitcoin with suspicion to now scrambling to harness the power of the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology.A blockchain is a shared digital database that allows transactions to be recorded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger. Cryptography is used to protect the data from fraud or hackers.Hendrik Kleinsmiede, co-founder of Visa Europe Collab — the company’s innovation hub — will say in a blog post that Visa’s latest project is designed to “reduce the friction of domestic and cross-border transfers between banks”.“We’re now inviting a small number of European banks to participate in the project alongside us and BTL,” he will say. “Participating banks will be able to connect to the network and send funds to other banks in the network across multiple currencies.”The project is designed to cut costs, speed up settlement time and reduce credit risk in the market for moving money between banks both domestically and across borders.It could represent a challenge to the Swift interbank payment system, the main messaging system used by banks to handle large money transfers. Swift has recognised the potential threat and has itself been examining blockchain’s potential.BTL was founded last year by the brothers Guy and Hugh Halford-Thomson, who previously ran a bitcoin brokerage and operated the UK’s first bitcoin ATM, which was once used by George Osborne, the former chancellor.The project being developed with Visa uses smart contracts — code written on to the blockchain that automatically carries out certain actions — to handle much of the regulatory and compliance requirements of interbank transfers.The smart contracts could reduce the counterparty risk of cross-border transfers by making them simultaneous, rather than leaving one lender on the hook for a time, Guy Halford-Thomson told the Financial Times.Mr Kleinsmiede said Visa aimed to complete the “proof of concept” within 100 days, by which time he expected to have found banks to send money between each other using the blockchain technology.“Through the use of smart contracts and blockchains I believe we can create a fast, compliant and low-cost interbank payment and settlement service, with embedded regional compliance,” he said.Visa’s innovation lab has already announced other projects involving blockchain technology, including micropayments, machine-to-machine transfers and business-to-business payments.Last week, four of the world’s biggest banks — UBS, Santander, Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon — announced they had teamed up with broker ICAP and technology developer Clearmatics to develop a form of digital cash that they believe will become an industry standard to clear and settle financial trades over blockchain.
77;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
78;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;MasterCard and PayPal hold talks on strategic alliance;‘Constructive dialogue’ follows online payment group’s deal with Visa;MasterCard is talking to PayPal to reach a rapprochement after years of friction between the card network and the online payments business.PayPal’s expansion has come at the expense of networks such as MasterCard as many of its users link directly to their bank accounts, circumventing credit and debit cards.But a week ago PayPal struck a deal with MasterCard’s larger rival Visa. Presenting quarterly results on Thursday, Ajaypal Singh Banga, MasterCard chief executive, said that the second-largest US card group was holding a “constructive dialogue” with PayPal.“PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all have,” he told Wall Street analysts. “This is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless, simple ways of paying is good for all of us.”A deal would ease long-running tension between the companies. PayPal’s deal with Visa was an “iconic truce”, said Michael Moeser, consultant at Javelin Strategy & Research.He said “it will be important for MasterCard to provide something in addition to what Visa’s offered” as MasterCard “doesn’t have as much to offer PayPal” as Visa did. “It doesn’t have as many consumers.”Martina Hund-Mejean, MasterCard chief financial officer, added: “Everybody needs to remember that we were the first network, actually, to tell them . . . that the way that they’re doing the PayPal wallet is not good for the ecosystem.”“Both parties have to be happy and we’ll announce when we can announce.”Under PayPal’s arrangement with Visa, the online payments company will stop encouraging its customers to link to bank accounts.In return, the online payments specialist gains a boost to its physical presence, giving it access to Visa’s contactless payment points in US retail stores. Visa will also sweeten the deal by paying PayPal a fee based on the volume of payments that PayPal steers towards Visa.With 188m active users, PayPal is one of the world’s largest payments networks and is growing fast.New services from the 20-year-old company include Xoom, the cross-border payments app that PayPal bought last year, and Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments app popular with US millennials.Thanks in part to strong growth from these new services, PayPal’s payments processed rose 28 per cent in the most recent quarter to $86bn.Historically, PayPal steered customers towards linking their bank accounts because credit card processing fees were much higher than bank processing fees. These fees have come down over time, however, and the deal with Visa includes provisions that lock in these processing fees at advantageous rates.MasterCard and PayPal already have a co-branded consumer credit card scheme, and the companies disclosed this week that they had extended that deal.MasterCard generated net income of $983m in the second quarter, 7 per cent more than a year ago, helped by higher consumer spending.Shares in MasterCard rose 1.5 per cent, giving the company a market capitalisation of $103bn.
79;V;Visa Inc;2016-07-21T22:47:30Z;PayPal and Visa ink partnership agreement;Deal resolves competitive tension between the two payments groups;PayPal and Visa have inked a broad partnership agreement under which PayPal will steer more users to link their accounts with Visa products, a deal that resolves the long-simmering competition between the two payments groups.PayPal’s rapid growth has at times come at the expense of credit card networks, because so many users of PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo link directly to their bank accounts, bypassing credit cards.Under the new agreement, PayPal will stop encouraging customers to link to bank accounts, and in return Visa will provide “economic incentives” to PayPal.The deal will also give PayPal users access to Visa’s contactless payment points across the US, providing PayPal with an access point to in-store retail transactions.“PayPal has been looking to tap into the physical world for a while now,” said Jordan McKee, analyst at 451 Research. “Tapping into the Visa token service provides an on-ramp for PayPal into in-store commerce.”Both PayPal and Visa reported earnings on Thursday. PayPal’s revenue for the second quarter exceeded expectations, reaching $2.65bn, up 15 per cent from the same quarter a year ago.Its earnings per share of 36 cents on an adjusted basis matched analysts’ forecasts, in a quarter in which total payment volume across the network surged 28 per cent.Visa reported $3.6bn in revenues for its fiscal third quarter, up 3 per cent from the previous year.The deal makes a lot of sense for Visa, said Michael Moeser, director of payments at Javelin, a research firm based in Pleasanton, California.Previously, when a consumer signed up for a PayPal wallet then put a Visa card in that wallet, PayPal would incentivise the customer to link the wallet directly to a bank account instead.“You can’t have somebody who cuts you off at the knees every time they sign up a new card,” said Mr Moeser, noting that PayPal has more than 180m active wallets around the world after years of “explosive” growth.“Visa really needed to have a friend, because the ‘frenemy’ approach was not working,” he said.Visa really needed to have a friend, because the ‘frenemy’ approach was not workingAt a company conference in May, Charlie Scharf, Visa chief executive, was asked about the “friend-or-foe” debate with PayPal. He replied in strong terms, saying that while the relationship with PayPal had driven a lot of business Visa’s way, PayPal was using transactions to “do everything they can” to get customers to ACH, the electronic clearing network for financial institutions in the US.“Anyone that’s trying to take your customers and disintermediate you, is not a friend,” he said. “We’d love to figure out a different model with them where it’s consumer choice first, where they’re not disintermediating. If we can figure that out with them, great. We’ll think of them more as a partner.”Mr Moeser said that MasterCard, Visa’s big domestic rival, will now be under pressure to follow suit.Last year digital commerce, both online and mobile, accounted for $424bn, or 9.1 per cent of all retail sales in the US, according to Javelin. It expects that share to rise to $650bn in 2020, or 12.4 per cent of all retail sales.Bill Ready, head of product at PayPal, said that PayPal had been making it easier for customers to choose different payment options, and pointed out that the cost difference between the ACH network and other options had narrowed over time.PayPal’s shares rose 2 per cent in after-market trading, while Visa’s shares traded flat on the news.

81;V;Visa Inc;2016-07-21T12:29:45Z;Mastercard buys payments processor Vocalink;;Mastercard has struck a £700m deal to acquire Vocalink, the company behind £6trn of UK payments a year, in a move that will wrest control of the payments infrastructure from the big British banks.The US-based cards issuer said on Thursday it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 92.4 per cent of Vocalink, writes Emma Dunkley.A group of 18 banks and building societies including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander currently own Vocalink, which processed 11bn transactions last year – more than half of all payments made in the UK.Mastercard said the deal will allow it to “play a more strategic role in the UK payments ecosystem” and bolster its business in the country.The card issuer currently accounts for less than 5 per cent of the UK’s debit card business, with Visa dominating the market.Ajay Banga, president and chief executive of Mastercard, said:We’re excited about the opportunity to play a bigger role in payments in the UK, a very strategic market for us.Mastercard said shareholders have the potential to earn up to an additional £169m if “performance targets are met”.As part of the agreement, a majority of Vocalink’s shareholders will retain 7.6 percent ownership for at least three years.
82;V;Visa Inc;2016-06-30T01:02:59Z;Chinese tourist spending heads sky-high;Outbound travellers to eclipse Germans, French and British combined;Chinese international travellers, swelled by a wave of individualistic millennials joining the middle class, are likely to be spending more on their trips overseas by 2025 than their counterparts from Germany, the UK and France combined, a report has found.The rise to such dominance over the international travel market will expand revenues from Chinese travellers in 2025 to a total of $255.4bn, up 86 per cent from $137bn last year (see chart), according to research by Oxford Economics, a consultancy, and Visa, the payments company.If such projections materialise, China’s outbound travel market will be almost twice as large in 2025 as that of the US, which is likely to generate $134bn in traveller spending in 2025, up from an actual $101bn last year, according to the report.Wayne Best, chief economist at Visa Inc, said that the ease of overseas travel will receive a fillip from some 340 new airports that are expected to be built over the next decade. Similarly, internet connectivity makes it easier for potential travellers to book their itineraries and check out what attractions look like before they commit to the expense. An ageing global population will also see more silver-haired travellers hitting the road.“Travelling internationally will become more common and attainable in the future thanks to changing demographics, combined with technology advances that make travelling abroad easier and less expensive,” Mr Best said.The report used Visa’s payments data and blended that with Oxford Economics’ macro projections to estimate 2025 spending patterns. It based its study on households that earn at least $20,000 per year, a cohort it sees as expanding to embrace half of global households — 945m — by 2025 as the middle class in China, Brazil, Russia and other emerging markets swells.Of these 945m households, some 282m will undertake at least one trip a year in 2025, driving total spending to $1.5tn, up 35 per cent from last year. The study did not include spending on air tickets in its calculations, making the estimates lower than from some other sources.The World Travel and Tourism Council, for instance, estimates that $215bn was spent by Chinese travellers abroad last year, a 53 per cent jump from a year earlier — considerably higher than the $137bn estimate by Visa and Oxford Economics.As Chinese travellers intensify their dominance, so the tourism marketplace will come to further reflect their preferences. FT Confidential Research (FTCR), a unit of the Financial Times, found in a survey of preferences this year that more travellers increasingly sought individualised itineraries rather than simply traipsing from tourist trap to tourist trap.“Our clients go to the opera in Italy, watch the Northern Lights in Scandinavia and dine at Michelin-starred restaurants in Paris,” Wang Yang, chief operating officer of Zanadu, an online travel agency specialising in overseas travel, was quoted by FTCR as saying.Similarly, Chinese travellers — long famous for high-octane shopping sprees while abroad — are putting much more emphasis on buying experiences rather than goods, according to a survey of more than 1,000 tourists by FTCR. The new breed of traveller is spending more on dining out, a comfortable hotel and high-quality relaxation, the survey found.
83;V;Visa Inc;2016-06-07T23:01:24Z;Five lessons brands can learn from sports scandals;Corruption, doping and match-fixing do not have to spell disaster for a brand;It has been an awkward year for companies sponsoring sport. Football, athletics and tennis have been dragged through allegations of corruption, doping and match-fixing. At the same time, with the Euro 2016 Championship in France and the Olympics in Brazil, spending on sport sponsorship could be higher than ever this year. Here are five lessons brands should learn from past disasters:Don’t panicThe barrage of criticism in the media, even when directed at sponsors, may not be as damaging as it seems.“There is no evidence that the huge public negativity around Fifa officials’ behaviour has had any effect on key sponsors,” says Peter Walshe, BrandZ strategy director at Millward Brown, which is part of the WPP group.“Looking at our data, if you look at five key Fifa sponsors over the past year — Adidas, Budweiser, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Visa — their brand value, with the exception of Coke, all went up, by an average of 5 per cent. On average, the top 100 brands only rose by 3 per cent.”He adds that the brands had also done well when customers were asked to rate which companies they trusted.“You might have expected that trust would reduce. Actually it went up a bit. On the trust index they averaged 112 before scandal, and a year later, 117. The benchmark is the top 100 brands, which again are more trusted than others. They only went up 1 point.”Fans will always love sportDespite corruption, doping and match-fixing, sport remains one of the most effective ways for companies to reach out to billions of fans across the world.If you happen to sponsor a scandal-stricken organisation, try to distance yourself from the institution while retaining links with the sport itself.“These incidents have been unbelievably damaging to the brand of Fifa,” says Michael Payne, former head of communications for the International Olympic Committee. “A few years ago you might not have thought twice about putting the Fifa logo on your communications as a badge of honour, in the same way you used the Olympic rings.“Now you probably say, ‘I want to be talking about the World Cup and the passion people have for it and you will forgive me if I’m not putting Fifa in spotlights at the top of the ad campaign.’”He adds: “I am not sure that when it comes to sponsoring the 2022 tournament in Qatar, that there will be a lot of reference to Qatar.”Of course, he says, there may be some pushback: “Fifa will say the name of the event is the Fifa World Cup, not the World Cup.”Some sports will be hit harder than othersFootball is uniquely popular around the world, but if you sponsor a minor sport and scandal hits, you will have to evaluate the situation more carefully.After years of accusations, doping is now thought to be endemic, for example, in athletics and cycling. When news broke that figures close to the top of athletics also took bribes, Nestlé was quick to act to cancel its deal with the International Association of Athletic Federations.“In terms of athletics, the sport is suffering because its presentation is old-fashioned, its relevance is under question, and how will they rebuild trust?” says Patrick Nally, who helped Fifa commercialise in its early years. “[If I were a sponsor] I would be seeking some significant assurances that they would respond to radical change, and the drug element is just one small piece.”If you have gambled on an individual, make sure you have good lawyersOne of the best ways to reach a younger audience is to focus on the athletes. Even when she is not playing tennis, Maria Sharapova has 1.6m followers on Instagram, the photo-sharing service.“The benefits of sponsoring a star are great, but the risk is great, too,” says Mr Walshe.If you look at key Fifa sponsors — Adidas, Budweiser, McDonald’s and Visa — their brand value went up an average of 5%For years, sponsors have included morality clauses in their contracts with athletes so that, if disgrace occurs, they can cut their losses.Go in with your eyes open, says Mr Nally. “You take the chance based on all the criteria you can check. There have been enough incidents now. You have to look at what you would do if something goes wrong, but there are now plenty of consultants and risk assessors. It is very professional, very sophisticated.”How you react to a scandal depends on who you are“If you are Visa and it is trust in finance which defines your brand, the moment that something is jeopardising that, you are bound to react fast,” says Mr Walshe.If you are Adidas, you may judge that you could stay loyal for longer. But timing is everything — even in a bad situation, by acting ahead of other sponsors you can burnish your brand.Mr Walshe adds: “If you behave in a fair, transparent and first-mover way, justified by the circumstances, that is seen as a positive . . . Being slow to react is never a good thing in any crisis.”
84;V;Visa Inc;2016-05-02T08:52:44Z;Brussels briefing: Migration medley;;Welcome to Monday’s edition of our daily Brussels Briefing. To receive it every morning in your email in-box, sign up here.Another big Brussels week on migration is upon us. The flow of migrant boats to Greek islands has almost stopped, but Brussels is only in the foothills of the political trek to make the Turkey deal stick and the EU asylum system work properly. The European Commission will try to chivvy the pace on Wednesday with three contentious initiatives on visas, borders and asylum rules.1. An overhaul of the Dublin asylum systemThis revamp of the EU’s asylum rules is well-flagged but still hot politics. A Commission discussion paper last month raised two main reform options – and we understand the final proposal will be a blend of the two. So the first EU country an asylum seeker enters would still handle their claim (a crucial Dublin principle for immigration-wary northern states and the UK). But if a frontline state receives 150 per cent more claims than its set asylum capacity, a quota system automatically kicks in to distribute migrants around Europe (which is more to the liking of Greece and Italy). It is a halfway house that leaves plenty for EU states to fight about. There is perhaps even some fodder for Brexit campaigners (the question of whether Britain can stay in Dublin but remain exempt from automatic burden sharing will not be answered in the proposal).2. Visa-free travel to Europe for 80m TurksWhen Turkey agreed to take back migrants from Greek islands, its great prize was visa-free short-term travel for its citizens in Europe by June. Migrant flows are duly down but the EU is suffering from some agonising buyer’s remorse. Ankara is meanwhile threatening to call off the whole deal if the EU plays foul on the visa deal. The Commission will on Wednesday propose the visa waiver for Turkey and Kosovo (meaning a June decision is technically feasible). But Turkey will be found short of up to nine of 72 reform conditions, which France, Germany and the European parliament claim will not be forsaken. As this FT piece explains, there are enormous political challenges ahead. Turkey is being asked, for instance, to soften its (extremely tough) terror laws and overhaul political party funding rules. You can guess what Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan thinks of all that.3. Schengen suspension for another 6 monthsThis proposal invokes, for the first time, a last-resort suspension clause for the EU’s passport-free Schengen travel zone. It allows coordinated controls for up to two years at multiple internal borders. In practice, though, this will be a six-month extension for existing restrictions in Germany, Austria and Sweden. Approval for their measures are expiring but cannot be renewed without this new and different legal justification (note the controversial and more recent controls at the Italian-Austrian border are not covered). The cited reason for the suspension is, of course, the “deficiencies” in Greek border control. They have a few more months to sort that out.TTIP uncoveredGreenpeace have obtained a trove of confidential EU papers on the US trade pact negotiations. It seems all 240 pages will be released on Monday, covering 13 chapters from tariffs and agriculture to regulatory cooperation. Various newspapers have an early take on the leak. Le Monde reckons the EU appears the eager side, making little progress with the indifferent Americans. The Guardian leads on the alleged danger to environmental standards in Europe. Süddeutsche Zeitung highlights Washington pushing for a cars-for-food market access trade-off, and goes heavy the fundamental questions of law and democracy raised by the possible terms on regulatory cooperation. The FT recently ran through the five reasons a final pact looks a distant prospect.Brexit BankThe Bank of England is preparing for the worst. The FT’s Chris Giles reports on its contingency plans to flood the market with sterling to cope with any market turbulence in the run up to the June 23 referendum on EU membership. The liquidity measures are primarily for reassurance. More tricky for the Bank are other policy dilemmas if the economy does turn, either in terms of relaxing capital requirements for British banks or cutting interest rates. The New York Times meanwhile takes a look at Britain’s conflicted business sector, and the many companies that are keeping a low profile on Brexit for fear of offending their customers. You can tell it is campaign season when David Cameron gives interviews to Glamour magazine: the British prime minister insists he remains friends with Boris Johnson, London mayor and Brexiteer, but “just perhaps not such good friends”.Putin shakeupVladimir Putin is tightening his grip on power. The Russian president forged ahead with a revamp of Russia’s law enforcers over the weekend, a move that comes weeks after he created a national guard under his direct control (dubbed a “Praetorian guard on steroids”). The FT’s Kathrin Hille reports on the fears in the Kremlin over the danger of an unhappy public turning to unrest over the economic downturn. Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal run a valedictory interview with General Philip Breedlove, Nato’s outgoing supreme allied commander. He calls of more western intelligence resources to be focussed on the potential threat from the Russian military. “We need to be careful not paint them as 10 feet tall because they’re not…but they’re pretty close to 7 feet tall,” he said. “Russia has proved itself to be a learning and adaptive military force.”AfD congressIslam is not part of Germany, muezzins should be out of a job and the full-face veil has no place on German streets. That’s the upsum of the Alternative für Deutschland new anti-Islamic turn, endorsed at its two-day conference in Stuttgart. Markus Egg, a AfD supporting professor, insists to the FT that the policy position is not against religious freedom. “Sometimes, to start a debate, you have to express things in an exaggerated form,” he said. Politico has its five takeaways from the gathering. Bild Zeitung recounts how circumcision was saved from a ban. Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports on what it saw as a mouse of a congress, with plenty of in-fighting and party co-chair Frauke Petry in defensive mood.
85;V;Visa Inc;2016-04-27T14:43:16Z;Has Apple succumbed to the ‘Curse of the Dow’?;;Traders can be a superstitious crowd, and one of the best known ill omens of financial markets is the so-called “Curse of the Dow”, based on the frequency of companies peaking just as they gain entry into the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average.Obviously talk of a curse is anecdotal but amusing nonsense, but even the mighty Apple appears to have succumbed to the jinx, writes Robin Wigglesworth in New York.The tech giant gained entry in the blue-chip average on March 18, replacing AT&T. Apple’s shares peaked at $134.54 on April 28, and after yesterday’s earnings miss have now lost almost a quarter of their value since the March 18 DJIA inclusion. Meanwhile, AT&T’s stock has gained over 13 per cent since then.Even at the time of the inclusion, some analysts speculated that the “Curse of the Dow” might strike again. Here’s Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, writing in mid-2015 when Apple had already begun to slip somewhat:Now, you can’t blame the Dow stock selection committee too much. Their job is to pick very large and high quality American companies that reflect the broad economy. Apple fits that description nicely, and it does have the current financial performance to prove it. Analysts that cover the company on Wall Street expect it to produce +20% revenue growth in each of the next two quarters. But as the old saying goes, the difference between a good stock and a good company is valuation. And thus far, it seems all that good news was already baked into Apple’s slice of the Dow pie.But the Dow Curse has a muddled track record. Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Visa all joined the Dow on September 20, 2013, and since then they have suffered disparate fortunes. The investment bank’s shares have only gained a miserly 2 per cent since then, but Visa is up over 57 per cent, and Nike has rocketed 71 per cent.

Mr Moiseev candidly said these were being made more urgent by western sanctions on Russia.“The motivation has increased significantly,” Mr Moiseev said of the closer ties. “We are driven by outside [events] to develop bilateral financial links.”But the deputy finance minister declined to comment on whether Russia was in talks to issue sovereign debt in renminbi, as some bankers have said.The agreement with Unionpay, which is usable in 141 countries according to its website, would ease the way for international acceptance of the “Mir” credit card that Russia plans to issue in 2016, said Mr Moiseev. “Clearly we would like our national plastic card system to be as internationally accepted as possible,” he said.Russia has sought to increase its exposure to China after US and EU sanctions over the Ukraine conflict largely cut the country off from western markets. The finance ministry has struggled to find western banks willing to underwrite a planned $3bn Eurobond after the US Treasury warned them off the deal.The motivation has increased significantly. We are driven by outside [events] to develop bilateral financial linksWhile both Visa and MasterCard continue to operate in Russia, they are banned from doing business with two Russian banks accused by the US of close links to the Kremlin. “The very possibility that Russian banks can be switched off from plastic cards have of course pushed us to make steps,” Mr Moiseev said.Amid several rounds of negotiations over financial integration, many see Russia’s primary aim as access to China’s debt markets. Western sanctions mean many of Russia’s largest banks and corporations are unable to raise finance in dollars. Historically low oil prices have also hurt Russia’s economy and led to an increase in financing needs.Meanwhile, China is easing international access to its onshore bond market, estimated at some $6tr — the third largest in the world. Several western banks and corporates, including HSBC and Daimler, as well as South Korea, have over the past year issued so-called “panda bonds”.I want to make it much more convenient for investors on both sides to investBankers have told the FT that talks between Russia and China to issue a renminbi-denominated panda bond are under way, but Mr Moiseev declined to discuss the matter.“I am deliberately not talking specifically about the Russian Federation borrowing in China or Chinese buying Russian government bonds in Russia,” he said.He said his trip to Beijing had the broader aim of promoting the integration of financial infrastructure. “I want to make it much more convenient for investors on both sides to invest,” he added.He pointed to other recent examples of integration including a dual-taxation treaty which would unlock cross-border investment by lifting taxation on capital gains and coupons. He said topics for discussion also included mutual recognition of credit ratings and auditing standards.
87;V;Visa Inc;2016-03-23T12:22:01Z;Google launches Android mobile payment service in UK;Introduction of smartphone payment service ramps up competition with Apple Pay;Google is bringing its mobile payment service for Android smartphones to the UK, in a move that will expand its competition with Apple’s rival system.Android Pay will allow smartphone users to take advantage of payment apps provided by banks, credit card providers and retailers to either buy goods in stores or using retailer websites.The service will support MasterCard and Visa as well as many of the UK’s banks such as Bank of Scotland, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, M&S Bank, MBNA and Nationwide.The UK is seen by analysts as an attractive market for mobile payments given most people have a smartphone and are increasingly becoming familiar with other contactless ways of paying such as using a debit card.The country also has a relatively high proportion of retailers and coffee shops equipped with the necessary contactless equipment to enable mobile payments.Android Pay can be used to make contactless payments in shops, with a large range of places supporting the technology from Costa Coffee to Waitrose. Android Pay can also be used on the London tube, buses and trains.However, use of contactless technology through the near field communication chip in a smartphone is still far from mainstream.Android Pay was launched in the US last September, and the group claims that it signs 1.5m registrations each month.Apple took a head start in the market by launching Apple Pay in the UK last year, while there are also alternative ways to use Android smartphones to pay such as a platform developed by Samsung for its devices.More than 36m people have an Android phone in the UK, according to IHS, a research group, but only a quarter of active users have the fingerprint sensors that can make mobile payments quicker than a normal card chip and pin payment using a PIN.This compares with the 19.1m people who have an iPhone, although close to half of these are models compatible with Apple Pay with both a fingerprint sensor and contactless capability.Jack Kent, analyst at IHS, said Apple Pay had sparked renewed interest in the mobile payments market.Mr Kent said Apple Pay had an advantage of being able to use the wider Apple services ecosystem — such as iTunes payment — but “Google has lagged behind Apple when it comes to getting users to register payment card information, which means that it may face a bigger hurdle to widespread adoption”.He added: “Much of the focus on these new payment services is on the in-store use case, but the ability to drive in-app retail and commerce will be a major factor in the success of mobile payment services.”MasterCard said millions of cardholders and Android device owners in the UK would have “additional safe and secure ways” to make mobile payments and purchases. MasterCard said Android Pay was “simple, safe and secure”.“The strength of our technology means that consumers can enjoy both security as well as simplicity. MasterCard cardholders can feel confident about using their digital cards for everyday purchases,” said Mark Barnett, president of MasterCard UK & Ireland.

The announcement was made after Mr Infantino chaired his first meeting of Fifa’s executive committee and a day after the scandal-hit organisation revealed its first loss since 2002.Wang Jianlin, Wanda Group’s chairman, described football as “one of the most attractive sports globally” and said he “had the highest trust in Fifa and its newly established organisational structure under the lead of president Gianni Infantino.”Mr Wang is China’s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $28.7bn. He made his wealth in real estate in China but has since set his ambitions on building a global leisure and entertainment empire, acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Atlético Madrid, the Spanish football team. He also splashed out $3.5bn to buy Legendary Entertainment, the Hollywood film studio that made Jurassic World, Godzilla and The Hangover, and spent $2.6bn on AMC, a US cinema chain.China is a football-crazy nation, though one that is sunk in almost permanent disappointment over the failures of its national team. President Xi Jinping counts himself as one of China’s biggest fans and has said he wants the country not only to host a World Cup one day but also, eventually, to win one.“China and corporate China wants to become a major football power, and I think that this [the Fifa deal] is further evidence of that,” said Tim Crow, chief executive of Synergy, a sports marketing consultancy.“I would hazard a guess that more and more Fifa partners will come from the east rather than the west because there is no doubt the Fifa brand has more work to do, even if it can come back.”Mr Infantino said Fifa was “of course” aware of how the deal might look to outsiders, and had checked carefully it was in line with the “highest standards” of compliance. “Especially in these situations, it is even more important to do the right thing.”Last year, Dalian Wanda won an auction for Infront Media, the Swiss company led by Philippe Blatter, the nephew of disgraced former Fifa president Mr Blatter, which distributes broadcasting rights for some of the world’s biggest sporting events.Fifa on Thursday blamed “unforeseen costs” as well as increased spending on football development for a loss of $122m for 2015. Legal costs almost doubled to $61.5m, from $31.3m in 2014.Fifa was plunged into crisis last May when US and Swiss legal authorities instigated a series of arrests of top officials who were meeting in Zürich.
89;V;Visa Inc;2016-02-12T14:56:32Z;India is no saviour for a sagging global economy;;"By Derek Scissors, American Enterprise InstituteOver the next few years, the Indian economy will seem to be doing well, if judged only by headlines. Real growth in gross domestic product (GDP) was just reported at 7.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, which impresses some. GDP growth, however, is not translating into economic dynamism.Despite improvements in the business environment under Narendra Modi, the prime minister, India’s development model remains state-led. The state is horribly inefficient, inhibiting prosperity, and modest reforms expected in the upcoming national budget will have little impact.Counting on India as a market saviour is a mistake.Real GDP is unconvincing
Plenty of attention has been devoted to New Delhi’s alterations in the way it calculates GDP, and the old data series would show a growth rate that is roughly 2 points lower. But there are bigger problems than this.The first is not the fault of the present government, but frames policy and performance: India is poor. Claims that it is a middle-income country or has a large middle class stretch credulity. A survey by Visa, the credit card company, identifies India’s “affluent” as having average household (not personal) income of $24,000 annually. India requires more than a decade of rapid income gains to become a middle-income country in any meaningful sense.This does not appear to be happening. Nominal GDP growth is barely above 8 per cent; a small GDP deflator enables the impressive real growth figure. The deflator – an indicator of prevailing price trends – has stayed below 2 per cent and fell below zero in the July-September quarter, while consumer inflation is near 5 per cent. The deflator’s accuracy is questionable, further casting doubt on the accuracy of the real GDP number.Mediocre nominal GDP also fits better with other measurements. A purchasing manager’s index for manufacturing hit a two-year low in November. Prior to that, port traffic – which should be booming at this stage of India’s development – failed to reach 5 per cent growth.The largely state-owned banking system is similarly unimpressive. Credit growth has fallen to multi-decade lows, a result in part due to worries about distressed debt and very hard to reconcile with a purportedly world-beating economy.The development model is unwise
For years, policymakers have given the impression they believe India will simply get its turn for rapid growth, without a need for difficult choices. The current government does not seem much different in this regard. This wishful thinking may be understandable in light of formidable political barriers to economic change in the world’s biggest democracy, but it does little to drive development.The upcoming central budget will likely see a deficit equivalent to roughly 4 per cent of GDP. The policy debate is centered on whether this figure should go higher, in an attempt at stimulus. But the questions should instead be: if sustained real GDP growth at above 7 per cent is expected, what is the possible justification for stimulus? Why is there a fiscal deficit at all?The reason is the economy remains state-dependent, with not nearly enough private sector activity. To take advantage of its demographic boom, India must create millions of jobs every year for at least a decade. At present, astonishingly, the majority of the registered labor force works for the government. Unless this changes, dramatically, there can be no economic miracle.Private sector failure and state predominance extend beyond the core issue of employment. Indian officials toss around $1tn as a desired level of spending on the country’s inadequate infrastructure – but the last such target was missed by $300bn.The private sector does not have anything like the financial capacity to fill the gap. The volume of outstanding government bonds is roughly nine times larger than the corporate equivalent, which stands at less than 6 per cent of GDP. Total annual foreign direct investment for all sectors is only in the $40bn range.Needed changes are unlikely
Playing around with who gets what subsidy in the upcoming budget will hardly address such shortcomings. The biggest problem is land.Indian rural land is essentially collectively-owned – most sales and distribution of proceeds run through the state. The state’s utterly failed attempts to substitute for a land market inhibit the infrastructure programs it wants, which rely on smooth land acquisition. More important, the best way to fight rural poverty is clear individual land ownership. There is no progress in sight here.This leaves labor reform as indispensable. Private companies are reluctant to hire on a formal basis because existing laws make it very difficult to fire anyone. The Modi government is attempting change, but improvements have been minor. Unless private sector employment is greatly liberalised, it will be only in GDP announcements that a boom is evident.At India’s stage of development, land and labor are supreme. Less important but still valuable would be if goods and services taxes, which vary across states and thus inhibit internal trade, were unified. A unified tax is close, but it has been close for some time and its final form may be weakened by the omission of critical items.The underlying problem is the Modi government, despite working to brighten the business climate, gives no sign of recognising that the immense, incapable Indian state must be wrenched back from land, labor, and bond markets, and anywhere else possible.If the nature of Indian democracy or Modi’s own political calculations prevent this, the country will see inadequate job and income growth and its supposed success will continue to be superficial.Back to beyondbrics"
90;V;Visa Inc;2016-02-04T00:06:17Z;Colin Evans, Collinson Group, chairman;To spark ideas embrace disruption, says the travel firm chief;Colin Evans was suffering chaos in the departure hall of Tokyo’s Narita airport, when he caught a glimpse of first-class passengers enjoying the serenity of an airport lounge. This sparked the idea for Priority Pass, the first international lounge access programme not linked to a particular airline.The airport experience was more than two decades ago, but it led to the creation of the Collinson Group, of which Priority Pass is a part. Founded in 1991, the travel company includes insurance, health and safety assistance, and advice on loyalty programmes.Despite questions about flotation, he has kept the company private. It grew at a rate of more than 20 per cent over the past two years and turnover is about £350m, Mr Evans says.Describing himself as a happy workaholic with a low threshold for boredom, he does not want to float his company because he believes the resulting regulation would prevent the kind of experimentation and long-term planning that he enjoys. He adds that a flotation would probably also mean he would lose his job. “People already say I get in the way.”A self-professed south London “yob” with a BTEC in business studies, Mr Evans says he had no idea what he wanted to do after school. Interested in travel, he tried but failed to become a British Airways steward. “It’s just as well as I’d have been awful. I’d have started talking to the first interesting person and everyone else would have been left waiting for their drinks,” he says.He seems made for today’s business environment where companies thrive or die based on how well they adapt to the constant flow of technological advances. New ideas excite him. “I’m better working on something in the early stages rather than something that needs good management skills. The art of delegation is an asset,” he says. “That’s the joy of being at the top, you don’t worry about admitting to what you can’t do.”Mr Evans likes to hire people to whom his competitors would not give a second look, because “we have a culture of being alternative and we like people to be disruptive”.It was in the 1970s, while working at insurance brokers and management consultancies, that Mr Evans first learnt about using travel perks to keep clients loyal to their financial service providers.Collinson Group has taken advantage of that approach so successfully that it now employs 2,000 people and operates in more than 20 countries. Meanwhile, the firm uses what it has learnt to consult its clients on a variety of ways to avoid the defection of customers, especially the most lucrative ones.“Our clients target men who travel for business — and it’s typically men — while women mostly travel to conferences,” he says. “They will target men on how much they spend rather than how frequently they travel.”He tries to think up new products to lower travellers’ stress, though he quickly adds it would be unwise to market them this way.“Stress-relief is not a good strap line. Just like no one ever wants to buy life insurance,” says Mr Evans.His products rely on garnering customers’ personal data and he believes, that increased regulation and technological change are the two main challenges to his own and his clients’ future.Just as a hotel has to refurbish every five years, a company has to rethink its technology, though probably more frequently, he says.At the moment Mr Evans is closely following the agreement of Swatch, the Swiss watch company, and Visa to offer contactless payment services. It is the type of technological development that prompts him to think up potential products, including for his travel health assistance service.“Soon people will be wearing watches that could trigger the sending of an ambulance because of an imminent heart attack before that person realises anything is wrong,” he says, seeming to relish the idea.Colin Evans has clocked up sufficient miles over the years to earn British Airways’ Lifetime Gold Membership. He calculates that it took him the equivalent of 125 round-trip flights in business class to Los Angeles, Hong Kong or New York to make the cut.The self-described “road warrior” has a golden rule of travel: “I never travel with luggage in the hold, even on a two-week trip,” he says. Instead he takes a “mono wardrobe” of five blue shirts, a suit, two pairs of trousers and one pair of shoes.Mr Evans tries to experience local life whenever he travels to his company’s 26 offices. “I’ll meet the local team for a drink on arrival, irrespective of the time differences or my next flight. It allows me to bond with the people who help make our business a success.”He recommends experiencing new places because “inspiration can come from anywhere and at any time”.“I carry a smartphone, a Kindle and an iPad Pro. My iPad is loaded with my favourite tracks. I read The Economist, Private Eye and rely on the FT app. Finally, I still carry my trusty Nokia 2730 which is now over 10 years old. I know it’s old school but it’s simple and it works.”
91;V;Visa Inc;2016-01-17T17:01:29Z;Olympic sponsors Swatch and Visa get set to compete with Apple;The Bellamy watch will allow wearers to make contactless purchases;Scheduled to be released early in 2016 — initially in the US, Switzerland and Brazil — the Swatch Bellamy watch will allow the wearer to make contactless purchases worldwide, using electromagnetic near-field communication (NFC) technology.Swatch first released details of the Bellamy in October, when the watchmaker joined forces with China’s Bank of Communications and the China UnionPay network. A month later, it announced a separate partnership with Visa.Swatch and Visa are sponsors of this summer’s Rio Olympics and plan to introduce functions for the Bellamy that can be used by wearers during the games — for example, by allowing users to pay for event passes.The watch is named after the American writer Edward Bellamy, whose science fiction novel Looking Backward: 2000-1887, published in 1888, described a socialist utopian society in which wealth is equally distributed to citizens via debit cards.With an increasing number of electronic devices being used to make payments, the forthcoming launch of the Bellamy watch puts Swatch in competition with the likes of Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Although Swatch declined to give additional information, Visa says that, under the partnership, Swatch will run a secure site for buyers of the watch, who will use it to preload credit on to the device.The watch will have an account number and an embedded secure element to protect the data. Should it be lost, the owner can go on-line to disconnect the watch from their Visa account to prevent further payments being made.Visa’s deal with Swatch is not an exclusive partnership, giving the payments technology company the potential to have similar agreements with a range of watch brands. Indeed, Jim McCarthy, executive vice-president responsible for innovation and strategic partnerships for Visa, says it is open to working on other connected watch options.Once launched, the Bellamy watch could be easily used in Europe, where low-value transactions (typically under €50) do not require chip-and-pin processing. While it is expected to be able to handle chip-and-pin regulation in other markets, Mr McCarthy says the primary focus is on small transactions.“This is the everyday spend. With an Apple Watch you can walk into a high-end store and buy a TV. But people are conditioned to use their wallet for that,” says Mr McCarthy.“As behaviour changes, you could see that kind of purchasing [using a watch] in higher-end stores. But say you’re out for a run, you didn’t bring your wallet, you just finished and want a coffee — now you can tap your watch.”The move into watches potentially opens up communities that have lower levels of access to technology to Visa, such as India and Kenya. The company cannot install terminals in such markets, but with the Bellamy it would be able to take payments.“The rationale from our perspective is that these are markets where we are focused on bringing services to market that allow purchases, bill pay[ments], etc, to move through [peer-to-peer] transfers, so removing the need for a typical payment terminal,” Visa says.But will the technology help Swatch to sell more watches? Analysts remain cautious. David Sadigh, chief executive of Digital Luxury Group, a consultancy, points out that the key drivers behind Swatch purchases are linked to the design and quality of watches, and overall value for money.However, he says of the Bellamy: “It’s a good first step by Swatch. Their average price point is low enough not to be directly threatened by the current Apple Watch offering.”Even if Swatch and Apple are not yet going head-to-head, this is a market in which any competition is likely to be welcomed. Jon Cox, head of Swiss equities and European consumer equities at Kepler Cheuvreux, says: “Most financial institutions probably don’t want Apple Pay to become the dominant payment system, given its charges.”
92;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Growth in wearables sparks ‘battle of the wrists’;As Swiss watch exports decline, sector tries to second-guess changing tastes;"For the global watch industry, the latest James Bond film Spectre has a poignant moment. At the end of his usual gadgetry update, Q, the fictional head of British Secret Service research, hands the spy a new watch — an Omega product placement. When Bond asks if it “does anything”, Q replies, tartly: “It tells the time.”The question of what exactly consumers expect — or want — from a wrist device is increasingly concerning the world’s largest jewellery and timepiece manufacturers. The sector is being buffeted by economic trends, especially the slowdown in China, the strong Swiss franc and volatility in the world’s main trading currencies.At the start of 2016, it is also facing changing trends in watch fashions. Fashion-oriented wearable technology was a top theme at this month’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Fitbit launched a fitness-focused smartwatch.Initially, the Apple Watch and its various imitators were seen as posing little threat to the top end of the market. That remains largely the case. This month’s Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie exhibition in Geneva will celebrate innovation in precision-built, mechanical devices with timeless luxury qualities.But in lower price segments, there are clear signs that long-established watchmakers have been forced to react — including Swatch, the Swiss group that sells mass-market timepieces as well as owning the Omega brand.And the effects are rippling up the price scale, with brands such as TAG Heuer, Montblanc and Bulgari launching smartwatch-like functions over the past year. The range of new products and applications suggests rising demand for devices that are about more than just telling the time.“The emergence of Apple’s smartwatch and its potential threat to traditional luxury watchmakers is now well absorbed by the market,” says Thomas Chauvet, analyst at Citigroup. “If Apple, a strong brand with a cult following, is telling millennials that a watch is a cool accessory, it can only help the entire watch industry.” But Mr Chauvet warns “If the Apple Watch occupies people’s wrists, it probably leaves less room to wear a traditional luxury watch.”The challenges posed by smartwatches have come at what is an increasingly difficult time for the luxury sector. Signs of stabilisation in Hong Kong, the most profitable market for many manufacturers, are fitful at best.Meanwhile, the Swiss central bank’s decision a year ago to give up trying to cap the value of the franc against the euro has increased the costs of manufacturing in Switzerland. The franc is about 10 per cent higher against Europe’s single currency, although it has given up its gains against the dollar.Swiss watch export sales figures tell the story in numbers. Exports to Hong Kong in the first 11 months of last year were 23.2 per cent lower than in the same period in 2014, according to FH, the Swiss watch industry federation. That was partly offset by double-digit percentage increases in sales to countries such as France and the UK. Overall exports were down 3.3 per cent.This year might bring some cheer. The US Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates in December was a sign of a strengthening US economy, which could lift local luxury goods sales. But in 2015, watch and jewellery purchases were strongly related to tourism flows — Americans’ spending on trips to Europe, where the euro was weak against the dollar, left them less inclined to spend back at home.Against that economic backdrop, watchmakers are positioning themselves in the “battle of the wrists”. When the Apple Watch first appeared, there was uncertainty about its impact. On the one hand, Apple shapes consumer trends; buying one of its products is a personal statement — just as with a luxury watch. However, an Apple Watch is different from a mechanical timepiece crafted finely out of precious metals and stones. Moreover, it was unclear whether consumers would want multi-function wrist devices. Or if they did, they might switch to more traditional timepieces as they grew older — boosting overall demand.Some of the implications have since become clearer. Although Apple has released few sales numbers, nobody disputes the Apple Watch has created a market.“We have heard that US retailers have been anxious about stocking up with other watches — they want to see the Apple impact. It is probably going to get more traction, in terms of the watch industry,” says Julie Saussier, consumer industries analyst at Credit Suisse.A report by MyPrivateBanking, a Swiss-based finance technology research group, noted the rapid growth in apps for Apple watches — further evidence of their popularity. It criticised the quality of banking applications but argued they could be improved, and that wrist devices would be important in banks’ future interaction with their customers.Swiss watchmakers might seem to have particular advantages in capturing such opportunities. Switzerland has a strong reputation as a financial centre as well as for watchmaking. But so far that has not been the case. In November, Swatch announced that it had teamed up with Visa to provide payment functions on a new generation of “pay-by-the wrist” watches, branded Swatch Bellamy, which will use “near field communications” technology to allow payments around the world by Visa cardholders in the US, Switzerland and Brazil. Similar watches have already been launched in China.Other luxury goods manufacturers are similarly looking to leverage interest in smart technology. Last year, Montblanc, part of the Richemont group, unveiled its “e-straps”, which offer smartwatch functions but with a traditional fine watch. Also in 2015, TAG Heuer, owned by LVMH, unveiled its “Connected” series of smartwatches. But TAG Heuer hedged its bets. It is offering to replace Connected watches with a three-handed mechanical timepiece for an additional $1,500 once the two-year guarantee expires. In this way TAG Heuer hopes to solve the eventual problem of its smartwatch becoming obsolete.Meanwhile, Bulgari, which is also part of LVMH, is launching chip-enabled mechanical watches that act as keys to digital vaults, storing important information such as passwords and bank details. Nevertheless, Bulgari is not expecting chip-enabled watches to become the most important part of its business — it is not even considering adding fitness functions to them.The European watch sector is relying on the long-lasting design and manufacturing appeal of its high-quality products to address the challenges posed by Apple. That makes sense.“If you’re buying a luxury watch, the point is that you can pass it on to future generations, so you don’t want it [to become] obsolete after three years,” says Ms Saussier at Credit Suisse.Swiss and other European watchmakers do not have much choice. “There are opportunities to leverage traditional Swiss strengths in terms of precision, design and use of materials such as gold,” says Steffen Binder, head of research at MyPrivateBanking.“But I doubt whether the Swiss watch industry will be able to compete with the 500lb gorillas in the electronics industry.”"

Yet a handful of long-time partners of the elite credit card group are becoming rather less beguiled.Last year, Amex dropped a 16-year relationship with warehouse retailer Costco under which the two offered a “co-branded” card. The impending merger of hotel chains Starwood and Marriott has also raised questions about the future of the Starwood Amex card that many business travellers cherish.And last week, mutual fund company Fidelity ended a relationship with Amex to set up a deal with Visa and US Bancorp. Investors have noticed and are, themselves, jilting the company — its shares are down nearly 30 per cent in the past two years.Amex earns revenue through a “discount fee” (the swipe fees it charges merchants), annual card membership payments and interest charged on loan balances. The company is itself a lender, unlike pure processing networks such as Visa and MasterCard that must work with banks.Amex’s success had been driven by its customer service and a “rewards” programme that allowed users to redeem loyalty points for merchandise or services. For many years, it was an alluring proposition; the company’s historical return on equity has been an impressive 25 per cent.Since the financial crisis, however, rival cards from big banks such as Citigroup, working alongside Visa or MasterCard, have replicated the high-end products for which Amex is best known as a way to start to expand their businesses. At the same time, retailers are now permitted to “steer” customers towards payment cards whose fees are lower than Amex’s (though the company won, in December, a stay on a ruling barring its prohibition of such behaviour, pending an appeal).Amex has responded to the growing competition in two ways. By choosing not to renew deals such as Costco, where the retailer found more favourable terms with another company, it has opted to preserve high returns even if it hurts earnings. Full-year 2015 earnings per share are expected to drop 5 per cent.At the same time, Amex has decided to broaden its appeal. An initiative, known as Opt-Blue, attempts to get smaller-sized merchants to accept American Express while the company has also unveiled a prepaid debit card called Bluebird.Such diversification begs an obvious question: can an elite brand be mainstream? American Express has no choice but try to find out.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.comThis note has been amended to include a December ruling on American Express’s relationship with retailers"

Yields on high-grade debt have climbed to 3.66 per cent, up from 2.84 per cent last April.The deals on Tuesday included a $3bn offering from Disney across five tranches, which ranged from three to 30 years in maturity.The entertainment company behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens offered $1bn in 10-year bonds with a 3 per cent coupon at a yield of 3.05 per cent, roughly 80 basis points above the benchmark Treasury, according to a person familiar with the deal.Bankers were able to tighten the spread from initial pricing indications earlier in the trading day, and the 10-year debt ultimately sold at a yield below Disney’s last bond offering in September.Barclays raised $4bn in five- and 10-year notes, the day’s largest offering, while Citi sold $2bn worth of 10-year bonds.The financing arms of Deere & Co and Harley-Davidson, as well as Entergy Arkansas, also tapped US fixed income markets. The US offerings were joined by a $4.5bn debt offering from the European Investment Bank and a €3.25bn deal from Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler, among other global deals, according to Dealogic.Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said she expected a busy few days of debt issuance ahead of the start of earnings season in the US, when many companies enter blackout periods.Ms Lurie added that investors were closely attuned to swings in volatility, which could affect when companies come to market.“We’ll see more sporadic issuance, similar to 2015 where you had periods of a lot of issuance and periods the market was quiet,” she said.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

96;V;Visa Inc;2015-12-14T17:39:29Z;Former Wall St titans shake-up banking with fintech investments;Big names are busy disrupting their old industry via technology;They made their name on Wall Street. Now, they are trying to disrupt it.Some of the world’s highest-profile bankers have poured millions of dollars into the booming fintech sector during the past year as they tap into new technology providing online financial services from payments and lending to digital currencies and cross-border transfers.Earlier this month, Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who pioneered the use of complex derivatives, was said to have turned down the job of running Barclays’ investment bank to focus on Digital Asset Holdings, a New York-based start-up trying to cut banks’ back-office costs by using technology associated with bitcoin.Other luminaries who have swapped banking for fintech with the aim of challenging traditional businesses include Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive of Citigroup, and John Mack, the ex-boss of Morgan Stanley.Hans Morris, the former president of Visa, who launched Nyca Partners last year to finance and advise fintech start-ups, said Wall Street’s top bankers have been attracted by the scope to develop new, nimble products without being held back by intense new regulation required at the traditional banks.“The cliché would be ‘regulation is driving me crazy’. It’s not like that,” said Mr Morris. “It is the scale of what has been asked and the constant wave of new regulatory initiatives. That’s what gets you down.”Free of stringent regulation and legacy IT systems, fintech has become one of this year’s hottest sectors, with start-ups attracting billions of dollars of investment. In the third quarter alone, global investment into venture-backed fintech companies such as marketplace lending hit a record $4.85bn, according to CB Insights, a data provider to the venture capital industry.Goldman Sachs has estimated the emerging fintech industry could snatch more than $4.7tn in revenue and $470bn in profit from traditional financial services companies.The flood of money into the sector has also pushed up the valuations of start-ups, with several - including Funding Circle and TransferWise - achieving so-called “unicorn” valuations of $1bn or more.Some of the movers shaking up the old-world of finance are featured below.Since he was ousted from Citi in 2012, Vikram Pandit has become one of the most prolific investors in fintech start-ups. The Indian-born banker steered Citi through the financial crisis, but now his investments are in companies that are trying to wrest business from established banks.Among the 58-year-old’s investments is CommonBond, an online provider of student loans. It raised more than $100m in debt and equity from investors including Mr Pandit in September 2013. The company says a typical CommonBond customer — 32 years old with a FICO credit score about 770 and a six-figure salary — pays about $14,000 less over the lifetime of the loan, compared to a government programme.In 2013, Mr Pandit was among a group of investors who ploughed $2.7m into Orchard, a data and infrastructure provider for the marketplace lending sector that also counts former Goldman Sachs co-president Jon Winkelried as a backer.Mr Pandit’s fintech portfolio also includes MMKT Exchange, which is developing technology to improve liquidity in the secondary market for loans. More recently, this year he made an undisclosed investment during the $58m fundraising round for TransferWise which valued the cross-border payments company at almost $1bn.John Mack wasted little time in trying to shake-up the very business at which he spent more than three decades. Since stepping down as chief executive of Morgan Stanley in 2011, he has invested in a clutch of fintech companies, including Lending Club and Orchard.The 71-year-old banker was one of an array of high-profile investors who helped raise $130m for Dataminr, which analyses social media to create alerts for traders, in March 2015. The fundraising valued the company at about $700m.Along with former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and several prominent venture capitalists, Mr Mack also sits on the board of Lending Club. His 2.4m shares in the marketplace lender were valued at $36m when it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2014, but are now worth just under $33m as the company’s shares have slipped in their first year of trading.In September, Mr Mack participated in a $10m initial funding round for credit-rating start-up NEFT, or New England Funding Technologies. The company allows borrowers to update credit scores in real-time and hopes to launch its first product, the mPowerCredit platform, in 2016.After a long career in the credit card business, Joe Saunders, 69, was appointed as chief executive of Visa in 2007. He steered the global technology and payments company to its initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2008, then the largest IPO in US history, before retiring in 2012.A year later, he helped launch Green Visor Capital, a venture capital firm focused on early stage fintech companies. “Over the past few years, the changes brought about by the adoption of new technologies has been dramatic and will only accelerate in the months ahead,” Mr Saunders said this year.In September 2015, Green Visor led a $1.5m investment round in payments start-up Kash, a San Francisco-based start-up that aims to disrupt established credit card networks. As part of that fundraising, Mr Saunders joined the board as chairman.That same month, Green Visor also participated in the $8m venture financing round for Cloud Lending Solutions, a technology provider to marketplace lenders and other finance companies. Other investments include DataFox, the research and analytics platform, which raised $5m in July.Hans Morris spent 27 years at Citigroup, rising to become the US bank’s chief financial officer and head of finance, technology and operations for Citi Markets and Banking. He left to become president of Visa from 2007 to 2009 before moving to private equity group General Atlantic in 2010.In 2014 he founded tech venture capital firm Nyca Partners with a plan to invest $20m-$25m over 18 months in financial technology companies focusing on alternative consumer credit, merchant payment solutions and financial infrastructure software. “We bring together expertise on the financial system with lots of Silicon Valley connections,” Mr Morris said at the time.In addition, Nyca has invested in Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform that competes with Kickstarter, and Affirm, a company founded by Max Levchin, PayPal co-founder and former chairman of Yelp, that seeks to create a new way for consumers to apply for short-term credit.Mr Morris is also an investor alongside Vikram Pandit in CommonBond.

97;V;Visa Inc;2015-12-10T05:56:12Z;Strong demand for Visa’s $16bn bond deal;Record M&A run is driving corporate debt issuance in US;"Visa raised $16bn in the year’s fourth-largest corporate bond offering as a record wave of mergers and acquisitions drives debt issuance in the US.The deal, which will be used to pay for the US payment processor’s €21.2bn acquisition of its former European subsidiary, lands days before the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten US monetary policy, a move that may gradually lift the costs of tapping debt markets.The six-tranche sale with maturities stretching out as far as December 2045 attracted roughly $45bn in demand from investors, according to a person familiar with the matter.Visa priced $4bn in 10-year bonds with a yield to maturity of 3.193 per cent — roughly 93 basis points above comparable Treasuries — and $3.5bn worth of 30-year bonds with a yield of 4.31 per cent. By contrast, the 30-year benchmark Treasury traded just below 3 per cent on Wednesday.The issue attracted strong demand across the yield curve, with underwriters tightening spreads on all six parts from initial guidance early in the trading day. Visa did not count any long-term debt on its balance sheet ahead of the sale on Wednesday.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo acted as active joint bookrunners on the transaction.The offering is the year’s 15th US marketed deal of at least $10bn, according to data from Dealogic. Just three deals touched or surpassed that level in each of 2014 and 2013, according to S&P LCD, with only one reaching that threshold in 2012.The bulk of the jumbo debt hauls have been used to finance takeovers as executives across corporate America seek out faster-growing business ventures — a response to the lacklustre economic expansion and the headwind of a stronger dollar.Companies in the US have raised more than $325bn to fund acquisitions since the year’s start, four-fifths ahead of the record pace set in 2012, Dealogic data show.“M&A financing has been a large part of the reason we have achieved these record-breaking supply numbers,” Dan Mead, a managing director on Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s investment grade syndicate, said. “The demand for those deals has been robust and speaks volumes to the ability to price a $16bn transaction this late in the year.”The three largest bond deals have all been used to fund takeovers, including Actavis’s $21bn debt offering to fund its buyout of Botox maker Allergan; AT&T’s $17.5bn issuance for its takeover of DirecTV; and AbbVie’s $16.7bn deal to finance its acquisition of Pharmacyclics.While cracks have emerged in the junk bond market, with yields on the Barclays US high yield index climbing past 8 per cent once again as commodity prices tumble, investors have clamoured for higher quality corporate paper.Last week, McDonald’s drummed up investor orders of nearly $40bn for a $6bn bond sale."

100;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Swatch takes on Apple with Visa payments tie-up;Swiss watchmaker launches contactless payment services from wrist devices;Swatch, the Swiss watch company, is expanding its counterattack against Apple and other smartwatch manufacturers by teaming up with Visa to offer contactless payment services from wrist devices.The arrival of the Apple Watch has put much of the Swiss watch industry on the defensive, not least companies such as Swatch, which have lower, mass-market price models in their portfolios.Swatch said on Monday that its new “Bellamy” watches, to be launched in early 2016, would have “all the fun, colour and great design” that had made its timepieces distinctive in the past but would add payment technology. The new watches will sell for about SFr100, it said, with services available for Visa cardholders in the US, Brazil and Switzerland. A similar range has been rolled out in China.The launch is the latest attempt by Swiss manufacturers to profit from the popularity of smartwatches. This year, Montblanc, part of the Richemont group, launched “e-straps” that link to smartphones and allow users to monitor sports activities and find their device if mislaid.The Swatch Bellamy watches, using high-frequency radio waves to allow payments, follow the launch of the Swatch Zero One range, pitched initially at beach volleyball players but expected to be expanded to other users, which also have fitness and other functions.Nick Hayek, Swatch’s chief executive, argues Apple has created opportunities for the company by boosting demand for its own “smartwatches”.“We’ve been trying since 2000 to sell such watches — without success. Now Apple is there and boosts interest,” he told a Swiss newspaper in September.Analysts rein in forecasts as Asia exports fallRead moreSwiss watchmakers believe Apple products are much less of a challenge to the country’s top of the range timepieces, which emphasise craftsmanship and heritage — although export sales have been hit by the slowdown in the Chinese economy. They argue that Apple watches could even boost demand for expensive Swiss timepieces by encouraging younger generations to wear wrist devices.The Swatch Group also includes luxury brands such as Breguet and Omega. In July, Swatch reported operating profits in the first half of the year had fallen 8.3 per cent to SFr761m compared with the same period in 2014, largely as a result of currency movements. But the Biel-based company pointed to a “positive outlook” for the second half of the year, which has seen the launch of new products such as a “James Bond edition” Omega watch. When James Bond asks in the film Spectre, “does it do anything”, he is told by Q that “it tells the time”.
101;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Dash for debt ahead of US rate rise;US corporate issuance hits record high as groups seek to lock in financing deals;A spate of jumbo corporate debt offerings has lifted US issuance to a record high as companies seek to lock in financing to fund multibillion-dollar acquisitions before the Federal Reserve lifts rates for the first time since the financial crisis.US multinationals have raised more than $132bn in so-called jumbo-deals — debt offerings above $10bn in size — in 2015, more than a fourfold increase from a year earlier as companies including Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and UnitedHealth take advantage of low interest rates, according to data from Dealogic.The offerings have buoyed overall corporate debt deal values in the US to a record of $815bn, with more than a month and a half to go before year end. The figure surpasses the previous high set in 2014 of $746bn.There has been strong investor appetite for the debt offerings, which have been used to fund acquisitions, buy back stock and pay for dividends, leading bond funds to balloon in size.“It’s two years of incredible issuance flows,” says Mitch Reznick, co-head of credit at Hermes Investment Management. “It’s driven by a desire to get financing done ahead of lift-off and a lot of this is going into M&A . . . The issuance just continues and continues.”After a slow summer, with companies braced for a rise in interest rates that never came as they struggled with the global oil price rout, issuance has picked up. Close to $30bn of debt has been raised in each of the past two weeks. It has been a particularly big year for highly rated debt, with issuance at a record $633bn. The $182bn worth of junk bond sales trail the 2012 peak of $246bn.Investors are already looking forward to the completion of several megadeals, including AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller, Dell’s purchase of EMC and Visa’s buyout of its former European arm, all of which are said to include mammoth debt offerings. Visa expects to raise as much as $16bn to fund the transaction and repurchase stock.But the colossal supply is taking its toll as investors begin to show signs of indigestion, causing yields on popular indices to rise.The average yield of companies rated Baa by Moody’s — among the lower rungs of investment grade territory — has neared its highest level of the year at 5.44 per cent, while total returns on the Barclays US corporate aggregate index have slid back into negative territory for the year-to-date.Rating agencies have also warned of the increasing amount of leverage companies have used to fund acquisitions, with investors getting skittish about the rising levels of debt groups are burdened with during a lacklustre growth environment.“It warrants some concern,” said Andreas Michalitsianos, a portfolio manager with JPMorgan Asset Management. “It’s all well and good when growth is good and bails you out of high debt but you need a perfect environment for that kind of leverage.”While the pace of global issuance has yet to surpass the $2.24tn raised in 2014, underwriters expect the flow to quicken in November as earnings season draws to a close and companies get through blackout periods.The next few weeks may also prove opportune for companies seeking to raise cash before the Fed meets in December, when traders are expecting the first rate rise for nine years.“A fair amount of the activity we’ve seen, particularly of late among opportunistic issuers, has been a rate call,” Peter Aherne, head of North American capital markets, syndicate and new products, at Citi, said. “In the absence of exogenous events and if current conditions persist, given maturities in 2016 it is likely to be active as well.”
102;V;Visa Inc;2015-11-02T13:47:29Z;Visa to buy back former European arm for up to €21bn;Acquisition expected to generate big windfalls for some members;Visa has agreed to acquire its former European subsidiary for up to €21.2bn in a deal that will generate large windfalls for some of the continent’s biggest banks.The US group, which is the world’s largest electronic payments company, will initially pay €11.5bn in cash and €5bn worth of its own stock to Visa Europe’s owners, who include more than 3,000 European banks and payment services providers.Four years after the deal closes, Visa Europe members will be paid an additional €4.7bn if the European business meets undisclosed revenue targets, raising the total value of the transaction to €21.2bn.The deal ends years of speculation about whether Visa would buy back its former unit and gives the US payments company a stronger position to compete with rival MasterCard.“This combination strengthens our payments system in Europe, as together we have even greater financial resources to invest in technology assets,” said Charlie Scharf, chief executive of Visa. “We will continue to have a strong local management team in Europe, with London remaining as headquarters for the region.”Visa Europe is responsible for more than €1.5tn worth of payments, processing more than 18bn transactions a year in 38 countries, the company said.Barclays in the UK is expected to receive the biggest payout, as the British bank handles about 10 per cent of Visa Europe’s payments, the largest amount in volume terms. The UK lender could net as much as $2bn, according to one person familiar with the deal.Other European banks to benefit include Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Santander, which are set to receive hundreds of millions of dollars from the long-awaited deal.“Visa Europe has delivered impressive results over recent years and the board believes that it is the right time to reunite these two very healthy businesses under common management,” said Gary Hoffman, chairman of the Visa Europe Board.“The deal will unlock significant value for members both through the consideration paid and because the board believes a combined Visa will be better positioned to serve the needs of customers going forward.”Analysts said that the acquisition would help increase Visa’s earnings but they warned that MasterCard could win back some of the business that was previously tied with Visa Europe. Citigroup said that earnings could rise 5 per cent following the takeover.Visa said that it would issue senior unsecured debt to raise as much as $16bn in the first quarter of 2016, in a further sign of companies’ willingness to rely heavily on capital markets to fund large multibillion dollar deals. Visa expects to maintain its current investment credit ratings after the transaction.

104;V;Visa Inc;2015-10-27T12:19:14Z;New payments service to launch in Kenya;Interswitch’s Verve debit cards could threaten dominance of Visa, MasterCard and M-pesa;The Nigerian company Interswitch is to launch its Verve payments cards in Kenya, a move that should cut banks’ costs and threaten the dominant positions of Visa, MasterCard and the M-pesa mobile money service.Charles Ifedi, Verve’s chief executive, said fees charged by Verve in Nigeria were between 30 per cent and 50 per cent less than those charged by Visa and MasterCard, with savings on some services, such as buying mobile phone airtime, of up to 300 per cent.It is Interswitch’s auxiliary services, such as its Quickteller platform to pay bills and top-up airtime, that are likely to have the greatest impact on Safaricom, Kenya’s largest mobile operator, which operates M-pesa.M-pesa is used by about 70 per cent of Kenya’s adult population to make five times as many monthly transactions as credit and debit cards combined.The Verve debit cards are set to be introduced in Kenya early next year, with three banks — including two of the bigger ones — already signed up. Customers will be encouraged to use their cards with offers of cash rewards for each transaction.People without a bank account in Kenya, who account for some 33 per cent of the adult population, will be able to use Verve prepaid cards and top up their balances at agents.However, Mitchell Elegbe, founder and group managing director of Interswitch, said his company was not in competition with Safaricom. “We’re more of a catalyst to speed up transactions rather than being involved in them ourselves,” he said. “We want to work with Safaircom as well as the banks.”Our aim is to make payments intuitive. We don’t want you to have to think about the cost of a transaction when you make itMr Elegbe admitted that by introducing more Verve services, the goal was to make the cards “more sticky” so people would use them for increasingly varied transactions.“Our aim is to make payments intuitive,” he said. “We don’t want you to have to think about the cost of a transaction when you make it.”Launched in 2009 in Nigeria, Verve cards are used by about 45 per cent of the west African country’s 30m cardholders, Mr Elegbe said, adding that a further 16m people use its prepaid tokens or mobile payment apps.The private company that is 60 per cent owned by Helios, the private equity firm, processes 4.2bn transactions worth $32bn a year in its three markets of Nigeria, the Gambia and Uganda.Eric Musau, an analyst at Standard Investment Bank, said Verve’s entry would be “very interesting”. “The uptake of cards hasn’t been that strong in Kenya, there’s a phobia about them, and people still prefer to use their phones,” he said. “But if [Interswitch] can attract more banks and their systems work well technologically they will have something going for them.”Mr Elegbe said his goal is to start operations in more east African countries and combine the company’s operations into one regional network.
105;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Visa deal set to deliver windfall for European banks;Banks that own former subsidiary to reap billions from acquisition;Visa Inc, the US payments company, is closing in on a deal to acquire its former European subsidiary for $20bn as early as next week in a move that will land thousands of European banks large windfalls.The deal means more than 3,000 banks and payment companies who own Visa Europe are set to share in billions of dollars from the buyout, which could be sealed as early as next Friday, according to two people familiar with the situation.The US card company began early-stage talks to buy Visa Europe in the second quarter, after previous attempts to reach an agreement with the banks that own it failed.Barclays in the UK is on track to receive the biggest payout, as the bank with the largest volume of Visa Europe’s flows, amounting to about 10 per cent. The windfall for the British lender could be as much as $2bn, according to one person familiar with the deal.Other banks in the UK, including Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, are set to receive hundreds of millions of dollars, as they account for a smaller proportion of the flows.Visa Inc said in its last earnings release that it “believes there is compelling logic for both Visa Inc and Visa Europe to consummate a business combination”.It confirmed at the time that the two groups were in discussion, which they were targeting to resolve “by the end of October”.Combining forces will boost Visa Inc’s scale to compete with rival MasterCard, although Visa Europe already dominates the UK debit card market, with about 80 per cent of overall card volumes.However, there are some concerns that the exact terms of the deal, which are not yet known, could mean banks are obliged to continue issuing Visa cards for a number of years, making it difficult for lenders to convert to other card companies.Banks could receive a large upfront payment from the deal in cash, as well as a proportion of preferred stock with a long holding period of several years, according to one person familiar with the deal.Visa Europe has a put option, which the banks can exercise at any time, and requires the US company to purchase it at an agreed multiple of earnings within 285 days.Visa Europe and Visa Inc declined to comment.Listen to the Banking Weekly podcast
106;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;First Data: hard sell;The payments processor heads back to the public markets with a lot of baggage;There have been easier times to pull off the year’s biggest initial public offering. With First Data, though, the underwriters have a much bigger problem than choppy markets. The KKR-owned payments processor is lossmaking and stuffed with debt.Yet the company announced on Thursday that it would push ahead with an IPO in the next couple of weeks, aiming to raise more than $3bn. That would value the equity at $17bn. The enterprise value will be much bigger because it has, ahem, $21bn of net debt. Showing some nerve, KKR, which is not selling down immediately, has given itself a super voting right as if this were the Google IPO rather than a botched private equity deal. Another challenge is that investors have a sexier alternative: Square, the much-hyped payments company from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, should launch an IPO before the end of the year.What matters, though, is not the volatility in equities but in bond markets. First Data’s debt has fallen from 9.9 times earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation in 2012 to 7.8 times in 2014. That is still eye-watering — particularly compared with rivals such as Visa and PayPal which carry almost none. IPO proceeds will mainly go to cut debt. Then it is all a bet on stable cash flows providing a refinancing opportunity. First Data’s average cost of debt is almost 7 per cent, with some notes carrying a double-digit percentage rate. It should be possible to reduce interest payments and return to steady profits. Happily, collecting a cut of credit card payments is not a cyclical industry — revenues fell only 7 per cent peak to trough during the financial crisis.The biggest risk is that the much-discussed disruption of the payments industry by Square and its ilk will actually happen. First Data has felt the need to acquire a string of related start-ups with whizzy apps. For a middle-aged company, First Data may struggle to get on with the youngsters.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
107;V;Visa Inc;2015-09-09T21:48:52Z;Finance heavyweights invest in blockchain start-up;Visa and Nasdaq see potential for the technology to transform financial services;A group of financial industry heavyweights, including Visa and Nasdaq, are investing in a blockchain start-up in the latest example of enthusiasm around the technology’s potential beyond the transfer of Bitcoins.Banks, clearing houses and exchanges have become excited at the prospect of blockchain fundamentally transforming their business models.Blockchain is a new model for transferring financial assets that uses cryptographically secured networks instead of myriad third-party intermediaries.Supporters believe its broad application in financial services can speed up settlement times, reduce costs and cut counterparty risk.Visa, Nasdaq and Citi Ventures — a part of Citigroup that invests in financial services start-ups — joined Capital One, Fiserv and Orange in participating in a $30m equity financing round for Chain, a company that helps financial institutions build blockchain networks. No valuation was given.“Blockchain technology represents a fundamental, generational shift for financial services, and Chain’s platform is enabling and accelerating this transformation,” said Ramneek Gupta, co-head of global venture investing at Citi Ventures. “We hope to leverage Chain’s platform to rapidly test and develop applications as part of Citi’s multi-faceted blockchain strategy which has the potential to greatly enhance our customers’ experience well beyond just currencies and payments.”Chain’s new investors will also form a working group with the company, which launched just over a year ago, to explore the application of the technology in various markets.Jim Robinson, a former chief executive at American Express, is joining Chain’s board of directors, the company also said on Wednesday.Nasdaq already has said it will use Chain’s blockchain technology to underpin its new private share-trading market, in one of its most high-profile applications to date. Former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer and former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters have also lent their support to start-ups exploring its use.Former Merrill Lynch executive Bob Wigley recently hailed the cost-cutting potential of bitcoin and the technology underpinning the controversial currency.The group’s former head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa called bitcoin a potential “leading global payments system”, saying he had invested an undisclosed amount in Blockchain, a UK-based company that derives its name from the underlying technology, and was now advising the group.Blockchain claims to be the leading supplier of consumer bitcoin “wallets” — software used for receiving and making payments with the currency. Last year, the company raised $30m in funding from investors including Sir Richard Branson, Lightspeed Ventures and Wicklow Capital, which at the time was the largest single funding round by a bitcoin business.

New York-based CommonBond is among an emerging second rank; smaller than the likes of Lending Club, Prosper and SoFi, but growing fast by encouraging high-income graduates to refinance government-backed loans.It has now raised a fourth shot of equity to “double down across the business, across sales, technology and marketing,” according to David Klein, chief executive.Mr Morris, who was president of the world's largest payments company between 2007 and 2009, is investing a smaller sum than August Capital, a Menlo Park-based venture fund which is leading the transaction. Other existing CommonBond investors such as Vikram Pandit, former chief executive of Citigroup, and Tom Kalaris, ex-head of the wealth business at Barclays, have chipped in undisclosed sums to preserve their percentage ownership of the company.“I think [ student loans] is a very good spot, and I think they have the best product,” said Mr Morris.Morgan Stanley estimates that US marketplace-lending originations will increase to more than 8 per cent of total consumer unsecured lending and 16 per cent of small-business lending within five years, with much of the loan volume taken from traditional retail banks.Doubts creep in over marketplace model’s ‘innovation’Read moreMeanwhile some of the leading players continue to hire people from mainstream banks and financial companies. Last month Lending Club, the biggest operator in the sector, announced that it had hired Sandeep Bhandari as chief credit officer, from Capital One Bank. In July CommonBond recruited Morgan Edwards, a longtime Wall Street leveraged debt specialist, as its chief financial officer.Mr Morris’s investment will be made through Nyca Partners, a vehicle he set up two years ago with the aim of bridging cultural gaps between New York and the high-tech hubs of California. Portfolio companies include Affirm, which offers payment plans for online purchases; Digit, an automated savings plan; and Payoneer, a cross-border payments company.Mr Klein said that the typical CommonBond customer — aged 32, with a six-figure income, and a FICO credit score around 770, well clear of the 640 threshold for prime — pays about $14,000 less over the lifetime of the loan, compared to a government programme. He is now considering moves into personal loans and mortgages for this elite class of borrower. “We’re thinking about products and services they need and will need. Already, many of these folks are entrusting us with the largest financial decision of their lives,” he said."

It declined to say how much the issuers would be reimbursed. However, a person familiar with the settlement said the amount that Target had agreed to fund Visa and its issuers was up to $67m. The breach has been estimated to have cost banks more than $200m.“Offers are being extended to the remaining group of eligible Visa issuers using a settlement formula that would enable them to achieve the same economics as the Visa issuers that have already settled with Target and Visa,” the company said.The 2013 hack resulted in the theft of about 40m customers’ credit card details and about 70m customers’ names and contact details. The breach shook consumer confidence in Target, hitting sales in the months following the disclosure of the stolen data.Identity and credit card data theft is becoming an increasing headache for retailers, with the number of US breaches in 2014 climbing to a record high of 783, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a 27.5 per cent increase from the previous year. The ITRC said that since it started collecting data in 2005, there had been more than 5,000 incidents of data theft of more than 675m records.Home Depot is another US retailer that has been hit by customer data theft, while Sony last year became embroiled in an embarrassing leak of executive emails after being hacked.Lloyd’s, the UK insurer, has estimated that the total cost of cyber attacks to businesses has reached as much as $400bn a year.The Target settlement was not greeted warmly by all involved.Carrie Hunt at the The National Association of Federal Credit Unions said Congress “should enact national data security standards for retailers and hold them directly accountable for their data breaches”.She added that while the settlement was a start credit unions deserve to be fully compensated for their losses.Charles Zimmerman of Zimmerman Reed, class counsel for five banks over the data breach, urged his clients not to accept the settlement, accusing the companies of negotiating the deal “under a veil of secrecy”.The banks being represented are Umpqua Bank, Mutual Bank, Village Bank, CSE Federal Credit Union, and First Federal Savings of Lorain.Since the breach, Target has been investing in improving its data security systems. The measures it has taken include strengthening its monitoring and logging capabilities, installing whitelisting (or anti-spam) point-of-sale systems and a comprehensive firewall governance process.It has also limited vendor access to the server involved in the breach and enhanced security of accounts, it has said.Target said that it had already accounted for the costs of the settlement in its previous results.Visa said it “has worked to help Target reach a resolution for the expenses incurred by financial institutions as result of the 2013 compromise. Nevertheless, the fact remains that data breaches are an unfortunate situation for all parties involved – especially consumers”.“This agreement attempts to put this event behind us, and increase the industry’s focus on protecting against future compromises with new technologies.”Target’s shares closed 0.9 per cent higher at $79.69.
110;V;Visa Inc;2015-08-07T23:25:36Z;Berkshire Hathaway hit by weaker investment gains;Storms in Australia and forex fluctuations help drag profits down 37%;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway made a paper profit of more than $700m in a matter of minutes on Friday, as it emerged American Express — one of its biggest shareholdings — has attracted interest from an activist investor.The 6.5 per cent gain in Amex shares came on the same day that Berkshire announced weaker second-quarter profits from its share portfolio, which includes a number of America’s most famous brands, including Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo and IBM, as well as Amex.Net income in the quarter dropped 37 per cent to $4bn. In the same period last year, it recorded $2.4bn in investment gains, but the equivalent figure this year was just $362m.The company also reported a $411m underwriting loss at its reinsurance arm, in part due to storms in Australia and foreign exchange fluctuations.ValueAct, a San Francisco-based hedge fund, has invested $1bn for a stake of a little more than 1 per cent in Amex and is considering ways in which it might pressure the company to improve revenue growth, according to sources familiar with conversations between the two sides.The fund has not yet decided, however, if it will hold the stake for the long term and seek a seat on the board.Berkshire owns 15 per cent of Amex. Before Friday’s spike, the stock had dropped about one-fifth since the beginning of the year.In February, the company announced that it would end a 16 year-old joint-branding partnership with Costco, the discount retailer, which had accounted for roughly 8 per cent of Amex’s total billed business last year and one-fifth of Amex’s worldwide credit-card loan book.“The credit-card business has become hyper-competitive, so replacing the lost Costco business will be a challenge,” said Kathleen Shanley, a bond analyst at Gimme Credit in New York.A week after that announcement, a federal judge ruled that Amex violated US antitrust law by barring about 3.4m businesses that accept its branded credit and charge cards from steering customers towards alternative brands, such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. The ruling, which took effect last month, allows merchants to offer coupons, surcharges or discounts to promote competing brands, if they want to.Fears over Amex’s growth prospects were hardly eased by the company’s second-quarter earnings last month, which showed profits boosted by lower provisions and cost cuts rather than revenues, noted Mark DeVries, a Barclays analyst.ValueAct, founded by former Fidelity fund manager Jeff Ubben, is one of the more consensual activist managers, eschewing public criticism of companies and positioning itself as an ally of reform-minded chief executives. Last week, ValueAct revealed it had become the largest shareholder in Rolls-Royce, the aero engines maker, where it is likely to seek a board seat.Mr Buffett regularly warns shareholders that investment gains and losses make for volatile quarterly results.
111;V;Visa Inc;2015-07-31T17:27:10Z;How to . . . avoid holiday scams;Fraudsters are exploiting the trend to book villas and apartments online direct with owners;It is the stuff of holiday nightmares. After an early start from the UK to reach your chosen villa in the sun, you arrive many hours later, ready to relax poolside with a chilled drink.But when you come to the door, you discover another family is already there, and neither they, the homeowners nor the booking agent have the slightest idea who you are.Worse still, the person to whom you made a hefty payment three months earlier has vanished, their mobile phone disabled and bank account emptied.The internet has given new life to the market for holiday homes, allowing travellers huge choice and convenience when booking a break. But just as with any internet marketplace, its rapid growth has attracted those willing to exploit its technology to commit crimes at arm’s length.We look at the rise of holiday booking fraud and the precautions that you can take to ensure you don’t become its next victim.Some 1,569 cases of holiday booking fraud were reported in 2014, according to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, a section of the City of London Police. This amounted to £2.2m taken from unsuspecting UK travellers, with an average loss of nearly £900.But actual fraud is likely to be far higher. Sean Tipton, a spokesman for ABTA, the association for travel agents and operators, said: “Most people don’t report fraud because they don’t know where to go, they don’t think it’ll do any good or they’re embarrassed.”A common type of fraud is “spoofing”, where fraudsters either hack into the accounts of owners on rental home sites or create fictitious pages or websites advertising homes that do not exist or are already booked legitimately. They might send spoof emails pretending to be the owner — often dressed up to look like an email from a well-known rental brand — which then inveigle the traveller to send money to the criminal’s bank account.Other types include fake airlines, where travellers buy a fake ticket from a fraudulent online provider or pay for one that never arrives, and sporting or religious fraud where criminals concoct fake tickets or accommodation for the World Cup or trips to the Hajj in Saudi Arabia — events in such high demand that people are tempted by what seems like a bargain buy.Rental home companies say contacting owners before and after booking is one of the best anti-fraud checks.Erica Chang, senior regional director at HomeAway UK, says: “We advise people to call the phone number on the ad and ask them specific questions about your booking, things you want on your holiday, about your travel dates, about availability. If you start to feel a little uncomfortable, your second port of call should be our customer care service.”A site’s staff should be able to verify whether a fake telephone number has been used or double-check the details of the property.There is nothing to stop a clever swindler posing as a fake “owner” on the phone, but most are looking for a quick gain and will be reluctant to spend time answering detailed queries about a fake or “spoofed” property. Eagerness to end the conversation and complete payment should be another red flag for travellers.The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) said it is receiving a growing number of reports of firms either being contacted by fraudsters or falling victim to fraudulent activity.Continue readingAnother alarm bell can be an absence of reviews or a very recent clustering of positive reviews. “The more reviews a home has, the more comfortable you can feel with the owner and the home. It shows a lot of people have travelled there. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not fraudulent, it’s just less likely to be,” says Ms Chang.When booking a property through a company, keep an eye out for slight changes to the company name in the website address, as variations can indicate spoofing. If paying online via a reputable company, there should be a secure connection indicated by the letters “https://” at the beginning of the web address.Last-minute bookers should be particularly vigilant as criminals target peak periods — summer holiday or school breaks — when people are hunting for bargains. They can also charge more during these periods because demand is high. Their pricing is often finely judged, Mr Tipton says: “If the market rate for a villa is £2,000 they won’t offer it for £500, they’ll offer it for £1,500. They’re not stupid.”Equally, users should be suspicious of gorgeous houses in glamorous locations being offered at popular times for £500 or less a week. If a low-ball offer seems too good to be true, it very probably is.One of the best sources of comfort for those booking is to go through the bespoke payment systems offered by the bigger home rental sites.These give reassurance that the payments are going to the right recipient, and if anything untoward happens will provide a certain level of compensation. HomeAway Payments, for instance, means a payment is covered against internet fraud for up to £10,000. Booking with credit cards such as Visa or MasterCard typically offers similar or higher amounts of protection from fraud.From apartments on the Costa del Sol and villas on the Côte d’Azur to ski chalets in the Alps, Britons are rediscovering their appetite for owning an overseas bolt-hole. Continue readingOutside the “walled garden” of a secure payment system, there is much less protection. Western Union, banker’s draft or cashier’s cheque, for instance, are discouraged by the big sites.Airbnb, for instance, discourages users of its hosting services from venturing beyond its payments systems. “If a transaction happens outside of our platform and we have no record of it, it is very difficult for us to provide any assistance,” it says. Depending on the circumstances, HomeAway may offer up to £700 to a customer defrauded even after booking outside its secure payment system.Lastly, email can offer the fraudster another avenue of attack: home rental websites will usually have their own email communication systems, so owners and clients cannot email each other without going through the site. Resist the temptation to go off-grid if invited by an “owner”, as this may be an attempt to inveigle you into revealing sensitive financial information or persuade you to transfer cash for a fake booking outside the site’s payment system.For tips on avoiding holiday related fraud, visit http://abta.com/fraud. If you are the victim of a fraud, report the incident at 0300 123 2040 or via www.actionfraud.police.uk.Not all holiday home scams are perpetrated on the holiday-maker. One variant, though less common, targets the owner. How does it work?1. The fraudster gets in touch and asks to book time, often over a long period to increase the value of the payment.2. He says he had already paid for a stay elsewhere, but the other owner had to cancel after a supposed catastrophe, such as flooding or the roof falling in.3. The cost of the stay at the other place was, say, £5,000, compared to £3,000 at your place.4. He says that for “simplicity” he will instruct the other owner to send you a cheque for £5,000. You can then wire the difference of £2,000 directly to him.5. The cheque arrives from the alleged landlord. You bank it on receipt and transfer the difference. Being a foreign cheque, it appears to have been deposited safely but then bounces. Your phantom guest vanishes.One owner, who did not wish to be identified, said a scammer had set off alarm bells when he asked to book her home for three weeks in March, an unseasonal period, was overly effusive about the property and gave unsolicited and irrelevant information about his personal circumstances.But it was only after ringing the help desk at the home rental company that the owner realised the nature of the scam. “I couldn’t quite put my finger on it but I knew something was fishy about it,” she said. Going back to her “guest”, she played along: but when she insisted on payment by credit card, she never heard from the man again.
112;V;Visa Inc;2015-07-24T00:08:43Z;Visa chief Charlie Scharf adds to pressure for Sepp Blatter exit;Digital payments group says ‘no meaningful reform’ possible while Fifa head stays;The chief executive of Visa has increased the pressure on Fifa president Sepp Blatter to leave immediately, saying that “no meaningful reform” is possible under the organisation’s current leadership.Mr Blatter, under fire for presiding over a massive corruption scandal, resigned last month but said he would continue in his post until an extraordinary congress to be held some time between December and March next year. Until then, he said he would work to install new reforms to make world football’s governing body more honest and transparent.But during a quarterly results presentation on Thursday afternoon, Charlie Scharf, chief executive of the digital payments company, described such moves as “wholly inadequate”, and a sign of Fifa’s “lack of awareness of the seriousness of the changes which are needed”. He called for the creation of an independent, third party led by one or more “impartial” leaders to formulate reforms. He also implied that Mr Blatter should go now, if Fifa wanted to preserve its relationship with Visa, which became a top-tier sponsor in 2007 and recently extended its relationship until 2022.“We want to be proud to be associated with Fifa and hope and look forward to working with them to that end,” he said.Mr Scharf’s remarks are similar to those made by other heavyweight World Cup sponsors, which have argued that Fifa’s efforts to improve its governance have not gone far enough. Last week Coca-Cola, which has sponsored each event since 1950, called for Fifa to set up an independent commission to lead reform, “overseen by one or more eminent, impartial leaders”.McDonald’s, which has been a World Cup sponsor for two decades and is sponsoring the 2018 World Cup to be staged by Russia, said it was not satisfied with the way Mr Blatter had handled the crisis, which had “severely tarnished Fifa in a way that strikes at the very heart of our sponsorship”.Departing president pledges term limits and pay transparency.Continue readingThe new line from Visa also marks a significant toughening of its position since last month, when it responded to Mr Blatter’s staggered exit by saying: “Transparency, integrity and fair play must be the hallmarks of the new administration and Visa stands ready to work with Fifa towards these principles.”This week Mr Blatter pledged he would ensure a fresh start for the organisation by the time he steps down, including term limits for top Fifa executives and transparency on pay. But his announcement after a Fifa executive committee meeting in Zurich was short on details — and his press conference was interrupted by a British comedian who threw fake bank notes over the Fifa president to protest against corruption in the sport.Mr Blatter’s announcement followed US allegations in May that Fifa executives took bribes of more than $150m in a culture of “rampant, systemic and deep-rooted corruption”. Last week, an official arrived in the US from Switzerland, the first of seven arrested at a Swiss hotel in May and held in connection with FBI inquiries.Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins and Lindsay Whipp
113;V;Visa Inc;2015-07-17T17:15:39Z;Apple seen as leading the field in phone payments race;Banking, tech and telecoms groups battle to be Britain’s new wallet;The barista at the well-known coffee shop chain looked blankly at the phone being brandished in front of the till to pay for the coffee. Clearly, if Apple Pay were to herald a revolution in the UK payments industry, it would not be starting here.Nonetheless, change is coming. The battle to be Britain’s new wallet has begun, with banking, tech and telecoms companies vying for pride of place not just in your pocket but on the home screen on your smartphone.While most people still use their phones mainly to make calls and send messages, banks have set their sights on turning them into payment platforms. A recent study by Visa suggested smartphones were on track to replace cash and cards as the preferred way to pay over the next five years. There would be £1.2bn a week in mobile payments within five years, it predicted.Apple Pay, which launched this week in the UK, is seen by analysts as having the best chance yet of turning the mobile phone into a mainstream method of payment, something at which many others have failed. But even Apple might not find it easy to break into what is still a small and fragmented market. Eden Zoller, analyst at Ovum, said: “Apple’s progress in the UK will be keenly watched across the rest of the world. But displacing contactless cards in favour of [contactless] mobile payments will be more of a challenge.”Mobile payments have been around for almost two decades. One of the first systems allowed you to use SMS text messages to pay at a vending machine. “It was a very slow way of acquiring a Coke,” says Deloitte analyst Paul Lee. Then in 1999, Visa and Nokia developed a way to pay over the internet or in a shop using a Nokia 7110 — very similar to what Apple Pay would offer 16 years later. So why do analysts think this latest development could finally lead to the popular acceptance of mobile payments?One reason is the proliferation of the requisite technology, from smartphones capable of carrying the secure technology needed to retailers with tills able to accept contactless payments. The concept appears sound. Like a wallet or purse, most people do not leave home without their phone, but it can also provide a range of security features that a card or cash cannot.The technology is shielded in a secure part of the phone. Limits can be set, while purchases can be made either using the phone’s browser online or physically by holding a special transmitter next to a reader.Apple may find that its brand could help it to win the trust of more sceptical consumersSecurity features that are being developed include eye recognition and location verification, so the bank can check that the phone is being used where the customer has travelled. Apple Pay uses a phone’s fingerprint sensor or pass code, while MasterCard is trying out facial recognition technology that has been dubbed a “selfie test”.The banks have tried to make use of their relationships with customers. Contactless cards are now commonplace, which has helped bridge at least the mental barrier to the tap-to-pay concept. Now, they have their eyes on the mobile phone or other smart wearable device. Most technology platforms require bank partners — with customers needing to tie their phones to their accounts to make payments or top-up credit.This also means consumers have the same protection against fraud using Apple Pay, for example, as for contactless credit or debit card transactions. Under the Lending Code, the most a consumer will have to pay towards the cost of a fraud is £50, providing they are not shown to have acted fraudulently. But banks generally refund the full amount lost anyway.There have still been worries in the US about high fraud levels on Apple Pay, which Americans have been able to use since last September. Cherian Abraham, a payments technology blogger, estimated 6 per cent of all transactions on the service were fraudulent, or 60 times higher than for credit cards. This has not dimmed the enthusiasm among banks to jump on Apple’s platform, a move likely to be repeated when Google launches Android Pay later this year.Banks have also been pushing their own mobile payment apps to customers. One of the more popular is Pingit from Barclays, which it says has been downloaded more than 5m times and used for more than £4bn in payments and transfers.Wealthier customers of Coutts and Barclays have recently been offered video banking services that allow them to see a financial adviser at any time, seven days a week, over their mobile devices.Other banks have incorporated Paym, a service launched last year, which allows people to pay money to each other using only a phone number. Barclays has signed a deal with payments provider Zapp to allow users to pay for goods and services with Zapp’s “Pay by Bank” app. Attempting to build on the success of contactless credit and debit cards, Barclays also last week launched bPay wristbands, key fobs and stickers that can be linked to a person’s debit or credit card and used to make contactless payments.But analysts say that just the number of alternatives alone suggests that these options may struggle to reach widespread adoption. Apple may find that its brand and the number of devices already out there could help it to win the trust of more sceptical consumers.Apple is far from alone in offering mobile phone payments, with a confusing array of rival services on offer.Samsung and PayPal have introduced “digital wallets” that also allow people to pay with the tap of a mobile phone or another gadget that features an NFC, or near field communication, chip. But so far, these services have struggled to gain much traction with consumers.But there are signs the major technology groups will make a new push in response to Apple Pay. In June, Google said it would launch “Android Pay”, which would work with smartphones running on the technology company’s mobile software. Samsung has said its “Gear” smartwatch device will support Android Pay. Google has not yet said when Android Pay will be released in the UK.Others may soon join the fray. Microsoft has shown off trials of a “tap-to-pay” system that would run on phones using its latest Windows operating system, which will be released this month.Rival tap-and-pay services are also on offer from telecoms groups, which have seen a chance to use the secure technology in Sim cards to house financial details and consumer billing relationships. But services offered by EE and Vodafone have also been slow to take off.Letter in response to this report:Excitement at the till in a Birmingham coffee bar / From Mike Horry
114;V;Visa Inc;2015-07-06T23:01:09Z;UK banks seek to Zapp Apple with digital payment services;Deals designed to retain customers as mobile systems gain ground;Britain’s largest high street banks are launching digital payment services in an attempt to retain customers and fend off growing competition from the technology giant Apple.Barclays has signed a deal with the digital payments service Zapp, enabling customers to make online transactions through the “pay by bank” application on mobile devices.The tie-up comes a week before the launch of Apple Pay in the UK, threatening to disrupt banks by allowing people to use their credit or debit cards via their phone, rather than having to dip into their account.Barclays is the only big high street bank in the UK not offering Apple Pay as it attempts to compete using Pingit, its own payments application. The app allows people to send payments to each other and pay bills through mobile devices.HSBC, First Direct, Nationwide, Santander and Metro Bank have also signed up to provide digital payments through Zapp.Card providers such as Visa have launched their own digital wallets to stave off growing competition from new digital payment providers. V.me allows people to make online purchases without having to punch in their card details each time.Barclays will incorporate the “pay by bank” app within Pingit by October that will allow customers to make purchases from retailers online as well as peer-to-peer payments.Anyone with a bank account and smartphone is able to use Pingit, in an attempt by Barclays to boost the mobile payments service.The addition of “pay by bank” means Barclays’ corporate customers operating in retail, transport, utilities, local authorities and financial services can gain access to the app as a way to receive payments.Barclays will be competing in this space with new digital payment companies such as Worldpay, Elavon, Optimal Payments, Realex and Sage Pay in offering UK merchants the ability to receive payments through digital apps.J Sainsbury, Asda, House of Fraser, Thomas Cook and Shop Direct are among a number of large British retail brands that have signed up to Zapp for customers to make mobile payments.More people are turning to mobile, which has overtaken branches and the internet as the most popular way to bank. Figures from the consultancy firm Caci show that customers look set to check their current accounts on mobile devices more than 895m times this year, exceeding the 705m branch interactions.Cyber security is of increasing concern, as new ways of making payments create new interception points for fraudsters.Zapp said the payments used secure digital “tokens” so that customers never revealed their financial details or bank account information to merchants when shopping.Barclays said its mobile app and Pingit had been downloaded more than 5m times, and there had been more than £4bn in payments and transfers.This article has been amended since initial publication to reflect Apple Pay’s launch date in the UK.
115;V;Visa Inc;2015-06-28T23:00:54Z;Wearable devices offer bank customers new ways to pay;Barclaycard unveils trio of devices for contactless payments;Bank customers will be able to make payments using a wristband, key fob or even a sticker at high street shops with the launch of a new “contactless” range.Barclaycard has unveiled the trio of “wearable” devices that can be used to make transactions at 300,000 locations, including Transport for London, across the UK.The launch comes at the same time as ApplePay arrives in the UK, allowing people to make purchases through applications on their iPhone or Apple Watch and pay at contactless points by tapping their device against a card reader.Barclays is the only major high street bank not to sign up to the ApplePay service as it pursues its own digital payment service.The wearable devices are connected to a digital wallet, to which consumers can add funds through the online bPay site or mobile app. Customers of any bank can use the devices, as long as they have Visa or MasterCard.Barclaycard has struck a deal to sell the three devices initially through Runners Need and Cycle Surgery shops, which are part of the Snow and Rock Group, with a view to offering them through a range of stores over coming months. The three wearables are also available online.The band is a slimmer version of a trial product released last year, while the key fob and sticker are new. The sticker allows consumers to turn any object with a flat surface into a payment device.Under current law, contactless payments are capped at £20 until September, when the maximum permitted will rise to £30.Contactless payments are a way of paying without having to carry cash, with the same fraud protection that is applied to debit and credit cards. If devices are lost or stolen, customers can shut them down through their mobile app or the website.Recent figures show contactless payment increased 331 per cent year on year in 2014. More than 319m contactless transactions were made to the value of £2.32bn last year.Lenders are competing to stay at the forefront of digital services, in an attempt to win and retain customers.Nationwide was among the first to launch an app on the new Apple Watch, while Royal Bank of Scotland enabled customers to log in on their phone using Touch ID, which recognises users’ fingerprints.However, despite the launch of sophisticated apps for customers, banks’ underlying payment systems technology is under pressure.Both Royal Bank of Scotland and Nationwide faced technology glitches last week. RBS’s problem meant 600,000 customer payments went missing, only months after the bank was hit with a record £56m fine for a similar systems failure.
116;V;Visa Inc;2015-06-14T07:25:08Z;Visa and MasterCard face down China techno-nationalism;Long-awaited opening to foreign bank-card companies comes with strings attached;"The opening of China’s bank card market to foreign companies this month appeared to signal the end of their long struggle to access a sector dominated by a state-backed provider, but industry observers say their battle is far from over.Shares in both Visa and MasterCard surged in October when China's government announced it would open the domestic bank card market to foreign competition.Regulations allowing foreign companies to apply for renminbi clearing licenses took effect on June 1 — but a separate rule announced by China’s central bank in November creates major headaches for Visa and MasterCard.From this year, all bank cards issued in China must comply with a technical standard known as PBOC 3.0, named for the People’s Bank of China.That is a problem, analysts say, because it differs from the international payments standard, known as EMV — an acronym for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Europay merged with MasterCard in 2002.The payment standards issue is the latest in a series of scuffles over Chinese techno-nationalism.In 2003, for example, China tried to force all wireless internet devices sold in the country to support its homegrown Wapi standard, an alternative to global WiFi. China eventually reversed after pressure from the tech industry, high-level negotiations with the US and the threat of a challenge at the World Trade Organisation.To meet the new payments standards, Visa and MasterCard would have to change the way they produce cards, potentially at enormous cost.""This will definitely impact the foreign players, but it is not finalised yet,"" says James Chen, greater China general manager at First Data Corp and former China GM at MasterCard. ""The issues can be resolved. The question is, how much space is left for Visa and MasterCard?""Payment card standards underpin the fingernail-sized chips embedded in global debit and credit cards, increasingly a substitute for less secure magnetic strips.While the US has been slow to adopt the chip-and-pin technology, China is following Europe in attempting to phase out magnetic strips. Both the international and the Chinese payment-card standards generate single-use data for each transaction, making the information useless for a hacker attempting to clone a card.""I don’t think [the technical standards requirement] blocks [Visa and MasterCard] from entering the market, but it is a delaying tactic that will hold them back awhile,"" says Gilles Ubaghs, financial services technology analyst at Ovum, a consultancy.Experts say China, if challenged at the WTO on payment card standards, may again cite security concerns, as it did when it tried to persuade the International Organisation for Standardisation to certify Wapi.The new rules enabling foreign companies to seek renminbi clearing licenses follow a WTO ruling in 2012 that Beijing unfairly discriminated against non-domestic electronic payment processors.The local incumbent, China UnionPay, was created by the central bank and spun off as an independent company in 2002. It is now controlled by a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks, with a succession of former senior central bank officials as chairmen.Chinese banks do issue Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit cards — whose payments are processed through their foreign-currency networks — but few Chinese merchants accept them. Instead, Chinese cardholders use them mainly for foreign travel.Even as Visa and MasterCard have been stymied in China, UnionPay has rapidly expanded its global market share. Last year, it accounted for 10 per cent of purchase transactions worldwide, up from 6 per cent in 2012, according to the Nilson Report.A key question for Visa and MasterCard is whether they will accept the technical standards requirement or ask the US government to return to the WTO for another round of litigation.While a legal challenge could further delay their entry into the renminbi market, legal experts say they have a strong case. Brian Mercurio, law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says Beijing may be violating the WTO requirement that countries adopt internationally recognised technical standards barring a compelling reason to diverge.The issues can be resolved. The question is, how much space is left for Visa and MasterCard?Advocates of the Chinese payment standard say it includes additional features not supported by EMV, such as support for near-field communication technology, which enables “contactless” payments.However, ""even if it is possible for, say, MasterCard and Visa to redesign their own chip to meet that standard, the fact that it is possible doesn't detract from the point that China would be deviating from the international standard and creating an unnecessary barrier to trade,"" says Mr Mercurio.""Visa believes that globally interoperable standards in the payments industry are critical to ensure cardholder convenience and security,"" the company said, adding that it is “confident” a viable solution can be reached.MasterCard declined to comment.Additional reporting by Ma Nan"
117;V;Visa Inc;2015-05-31T07:58:38Z;China opens door for Visa and MasterCard to challenge UnionPay;Even a small slice of nation’s bank card market would boost foreign players;Global bank card operators including Visa and MasterCard can seek licences to clear domestic Chinese payments starting on Monday, following a long-running effort to penetrate a market dominated by a state-backed incumbent.The biggest share price gains for both Visa and MasterCard over the past year have come in response to Chinese government policies that open the local payment card market to foreign players.In late October, China’s cabinet announced it would allow foreign companies to access the market. The government followed up in April with rules that take effect on June 1.Previously, all renminbi payments had to be cleared through China UnionPay, a network created by the central bank and now owned by 85 mostly state-owned banks. But in 2012 the World Trade Organisation ruled that China unfairly discriminated against foreign payment processors, handing a victory to the US, which brought the complaint.Industry experts say foreign players still face big challenges in trying to win market share from UnionPay, the settlement network used by 80 per cent of debit cards accounting for 72 per cent of total transaction value in 2014, according to Datamonitor.“Visa and MasterCard need to build up their local infrastructure. In the past they just operated as a sales office. They don’t really have the physical presence,” said James Chen, former China general manager for MasterCard and now greater China general manager at First Data Corp.“They need to start to recruit people and buy equipment — basically build from ground zero.”Chinese banks do issue Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit cards — whose payments are processed through their foreign-currency networks — but few Chinese merchants accept them. Instead, Chinese cardholders use them mainly for foreign travel.Before 2010, many banks issued dual-currency credit cards with both a UnionPay and a foreign logo. But dual-currency cards were largely halted after a dispute between Visa and UnionPay in 2010.Central bank data shows that banks had issued 4.9bn debit and credit cards in the country by the end of 2014, with retail payments totalling Rmb42tn ($6.8tn), a third higher than 2013.Even after the rules take effect, foreign operators face a long road. Though now ostensibly independent from the government, UnionPay has been chaired by a succession of former senior officials from the People’s Bank of China, and the government is keen to support the company’s growth both within China and overseas, where its cards are accepted in 150 countries.“Realistically, Visa and MasterCard are not going to be the dominant card networks in China in the near future,” said Tristan Hugo-Webb, associate director of global payments at Mercator Advisory.“Nonetheless, even a small share of the fast-growing Chinese electronic payment market will be a big boon for Visa and MasterCard as they increasingly face competition from other players in the global payments marketplace.”Twitter: @gabewildau

Mr Blatter, aged 79, won 133 out of 206 votes, leaving him four votes short of the required two-thirds majority.But his challenger, Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, the 39-year-old son of Jordan’s late King Hussein, conceded the race as it looked unlikely he could overturn Mr Blatter’s lead in a second round ballot that would have required a simple majority.“Thank you for voting. I will be in command of this boat called Fifa for the next four years and we will bring it back from offshore to the beach,” Mr Blatter said. “But we have to work on that, and on other things we have to do for Fifa in the future.”Prince Ali, who secured the support of many European countries, faced the difficulty of overturning Mr Blatter’s strong support in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia, despite this week’s turmoil.Mr Blatter remained defiant despite the storm that has engulfed the organisation he has run for the past 17 years. “All those who voted for Prince Ali, I congratulate you, he was a good candidate. But I am now the president of everybody,” he said.But several delegates inside the hall suggested that the twin investigations launched by Swiss and American officials into alleged corruption at Fifa’s highest levels could leave Mr Blatter weakened and unable to serve out a full four-year term.In his speech to Fifa’s congress before the vote, Prince Ali cast himself as a reformer who would stand by delegates as they face ever-greater scrutiny.“The eyes of the world are upon us and not for the first time. But this time, everything is at stake,” he said. “We have heard in recent days voices that described our Fifa as an avaricious body that feeds off the game that the world loves. But even the darkest nights are broken by the new dawn,” he added.The US sportswear company that is a sponsor of the Brazilian national football squad risks being caught up in the Fifa corruption probes.Continue readingHe did not directly attack Mr Blatter, but insisted that where there was opacity, he would be transparent. “I will not hide when things are bad, stepping forward when things are good. I will hold myself accountable to all of you and to Fifa,” he said. “Fifa is not a company, it is a service organisation. I commit to being democratic transparent, open and accessible.”Mr Blatter drew on his considerable reserves of charm and chutzpah to appeal to voters worried about the turbulence surrounding Fifa. What they needed, he said, was a “strong leader, an experienced leader, a leader who knows the ins and outs of the situation”.He was, he said, the safe choice. “We do not need revolutions, but we always need evolutions,” he said. “I will fix Fifa together with you and I want to do it now and tomorrow and the day after and the weeks and months to come.“Some may say I have been with you a long time, some may say too long. But what is this notion of time? Time is infinite and we slice it up. I find the time I have spent at Fifa is very short,” he added.Mr Blatter did not run an election campaign, has no manifesto and made no promises before the vote apart from to set up a new office at Fifa to liaise more closely with “professional football leagues and clubs”. He said the changes that Fifa would make would start on Saturday, after his election.His victory came at the end of a long day in Zurich’s Hallenstadion arena, where Fifa was holding its annual congress. Earlier, Mr Blatter warned Fifa’s sponsors on their relationship with world football’s governing body.Some of Fifa’s most important sponsors said they were reassessing their relationship with the organisation after US and Swiss investigators on Wednesday announced two probes, one into corruption in the sale of television rights and another into the bidding process for the forthcoming World Cups in Russia and Qatar.Swiss police arrested seven Fifa officials as part of the US probe and others have been detained around the world.Visa said its disappointment was “profound” and “should Fifa fail [to make changes], we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship”.The football body collected $5.7bn in revenues in the four years leading up to last year’s World CupFull storyCoca-Cola said the scandal had “tarnished the mission and ideals” of the World Cup, and that it had “repeatedly” aired its concerns.Qatar broke its silence on the scandal on Friday, saying it conducted its bid “with integrity” and had “fully complied with every investigation that has been initiated concerning the 2018/2022 bidding process and will continue to do so”.The scandal has shaken the Swiss incumbent, but he had refused to step down earlier this week, insisting at the time he should not be held responsible for the corruption.

Fifa 2015 Soccer
(Foreign Corrupt Practices Edition)
for Xbox and PS3, £22 from Esoteric ArtsEA has rushed out this special edition to coincide with publicity for the arrest of Fifa officials on corruption charges. It’s the perennial footie game we all know and love — with a twist. Gamers usually play the roles of managers steering teams toward World Cup victory. Here, they are presidents of national football associations, fixing the outcome of World Cup venue contests in return for massive bribes.The gameplay is awesome. EA’s physics engine models the trajectory of kickbacks with uncanny realism. You can replay a wad of cash cannoning into your trouser pocket from three different camera angles. According to the blurb, EA put 200 high-class prostitutes through a 3D scanner to make the bar scenes more believable.Sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Visa are represented as two-dimensional and strangely spineless. So EA has got that right too.There are some witty touches even Rockstar Games would admire. You get a bonus for awarding hosting rights to nations that are too hot for football or where the game has no fans. Players can garner further points for pats on the back from Sepp Blatter or making David Beckham cry.As with any high-level white-collar crime — benchmark-fixing, money laundering, whatever — the aim is to amass eight-figure sums without getting caught by the US, self-appointed world policeman.It’s game over for you when US attorney general Loretta Lynch bursts into your Swiss hotel room and tells you to assume the position. Watch out for sweaty US Fifa officials with chunky key fobs. They may be wired for sound.Critics will argue that this video game cynically exploits a sport that can inspire some of the noblest human ambitions to satisfy some of the basest. Its endorsement by Fifa is apt.The F wordThe skilled boss uses creative vagueness to pressure opponents. But the Irish Takeover Panel has no truck with the tactic, if that’s what it was, in the tussle for Aer Lingus. The panel’s green-cowled elders stepped in after Willie Walsh of International Airlines Group, said in meetings he was not minded to increase a €1.35bn bid announced on Wednesday. They nudged IAG to state formally 24 hours later that the offer was “final”.A similar episode involving the UK Takeover Panel helped scupper Pfizer’s £70bn bid for AstraZeneca last year. The difference is that Aer Lingus has recommended IAG’s offer. Moreover, the Irish government has agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake. The only remaining obstacle to the takeover is low-cost airline Ryanair, which owns 29.9 per cent of the Irish flag carrier.The acquiescence of the Aer Lingus board makes it easier for IAG to come back with a raised bid than it was for Pfizer. The owner of British Airways and Iberia can launch a new offer bearing the same seal of approval three months after the old one lapses.The board of Ryanair is unlikely to consider the current bid before a formal offer document is published in the next four weeks. That leaves chief executive Michael O’Leary to exploit creative vagueness himself.As an aside, Lombard once had a boss who tackled problems with the words “I’ll reflect on that”, knowing most would resolve themselves while he pondered. Annoying. Worked.Tate of the artWhich masterpiece of modern art best represents the full-year results of Tate & Lyle, a company whose co-founder also set up the Tate Gallery? One of Francis Bacon’s screaming popes might encapsulate how investors feel about an 82 per cent drop in full-year pre-tax profits to £51m. Alternatively, Tracey Emin’s unmade bed would convey a sense of how far reform efforts have got at the sweeteners group.T&L enjoyed a phase as a Steady Eddie business. That perception has been changed by three profits warning and a weak outlook statement.The artificial sweetener Splenda is the problem. Sales have been depressed by low-priced generic competition since patent protection expired in 2009. Had T&L followed best practice in the analogous drugs business, it would have ensured its pipeline was full of replacements.Instead, it faces a wait for formulations such as Dolcia Prima, a low-calorie sweetener, to deliver.The group held the full-year dividend at 28p, but precariously. Free cash flow cover of the payout fell from 1.8 to 0.5 times. Proceeds from the sale of bulk ingredient plants will support cover next year. After that, prospects depend on a tilt towards speciality products that is fraught with execution risk. The forward earnings ratio of 16 times would befit a finished picture better than this work in progress.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com"
120;V;Visa Inc;2015-05-28T04:57:52Z;Sponsors step up pressure on Fifa over corruption probe;Football body’s partners voice concerns over investigations;Companies close to Fifa have stepped up pressure on football’s governing body, after US and Swiss authorities combined to charge current and former officials with racketeering, money laundering and fraud.Coca-Cola and Visa were among several major sponsors of Fifa’s World Cup to speak out.The US payments company said its disappointment was “profound” and “should Fifa fail [to make changes], we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship”.Coca-Cola said the scandal had “tarnished the mission and ideals” of the quadrennial tournament, the final of which was watched last year by more than 1bn fans around the world. The US drinks company said it had “repeatedly” aired its concerns over long-simmering allegations of corruption at Fifa, and that it expected football’s governing body to tackle the matter “thoroughly” while co-operating with authorities.The statements were among the strongest from a group of sponsors embarrassed by their association with Fifa, organiser of the World Cup since 1930, which earns about 90 per cent of its revenues from selling television, marketing, hospitality and licensing rights. Coca-Cola has had sponsorship deals at every event since Brazil hosted the tournament in 1950 and had signed up to be a top-tier sponsor of the 2018 and 2022 events alongside Adidas, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Hyundai and Visa.Last year’s tournament in Brazil broke viewing records in key territories such as the US and Germany, according to Fifa, which said it had reached 451m Facebook users with official content.Dean Crutchfield, an independent brand consultant based in New York, said sponsors might look to renegotiate their contracts in view of the scandal.Tim Halloran, president of Atlanta-based Romance the Brand, said companies were likely to weigh the risk of collateral damage from the scandal against the brand visibility generated by the tournament: “Is what I’m trying to leverage out of Fifa, is that still trumping what is going on behind the scenes?”Adidas must be careful that its Fifa sponsorship does not become a reputational risk and damage its brandAdidas, the world’s second-largest sportswear group, urged Fifa to bolster its compliance standards but stopped short of saying it would cancel its sponsorship deal.Adidas “is fully committed to creating a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance, and we expect the same from our partners”, the German group said. “Following today’s news, we can therefore only encourage Fifa to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards in everything they do.”Union Investment, one of Adidas’s top 20 shareholders with a 0.9 per cent holding, warned that any association with Fifa could cause difficulties.“Adidas must be careful that its Fifa sponsorship does not become a reputational risk and damage its brand,” said Ingo Speich, a portfolio manager at the Frankfurt-based investor.Three key issues now come into focus: the future of not only Sepp Blatter, but also Fifa, as well as the 2018 and 2022 World CupsRead moreHyundai, the South Korean carmaker that along with affiliate Kia is Fifa’s “official automotive partner” for all competitions until 2022, expressed anxiety.“As a company that places the highest priority on ethical standards and transparency, we are extremely concerned about the legal proceedings being taken against certain Fifa executives and will continue to monitor this situation closely,” the company said in a statement.McDonald’s, the fast food company that is one of the second-tier sponsors of the 2018 World Cup, described news of the government investigation as “extremely concerning”, adding that it “takes matters of ethics and corruption very seriously”. It said it was in contact with Fifa over the matter and would continue to monitor the situation closely.Nike, the sportswear group, said it was “concerned” by the “very serious” allegations. “We have been co-operating, and will continue to co-operate, with the authorities,” it added.Sony allowed its eight-year, $305m contract with Fifa to expire in December. On Thursday the company declined to comment on the US indictment but people familiar with the matter said Sony officials had previously expressed concerns about the widening allegations and the group’s association with Fifa.Also in December, three second-tier World Cup sponsors — Castrol, Continental and Johnson & Johnson — opted not to renew deals for the 2018 tournament in Russia. The decisions came after several companies, including Visa and Coca-Cola, publicly criticised Fifa’s handling of its investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 events.Additional reporting by Jane Wild in London and Kana Inagaki in Tokyo
121;V;Visa Inc;2015-05-26T23:12:42Z;Apple’s core business ensures fortunes rise;Times may be difficult for some companies, but big technology groups are booming;"The world’s top technology brands, headed by Apple, extended their influence yet more deeply into consumers’ lives as their dominance increased in the past year. Times were more difficult, though, for companies in sectors such as luxury goods, fashion, retail and global banking.Global brand values continued to rise after their slowdown during the financial crisis, according to the latest annual BrandZ top 100 brand rankings compiled by Millward Brown, a research agency owned by WPP.Successful companies not only provided goods and services that were distinct from those of competitors, but also found new ways to connect with customers and navigate the swirling waters of social media.Peter Walshe, strategic director of BrandZ, says: “Branding is becoming more important. People are taking it more seriously and it is becoming more of a factor in driving value and success.”But, he adds: “If you are going to grow a brand these days, you have to have something meaningfully different. You have to have something that fits into what consumers want, and you have then got to communicate and drive that.”Steve Wilkinson, managing partner, UK and Ireland markets at EY, the professional services company, says: “In technology, there is still a lot of space to build brands. In the world of products and services, it’s probably more difficult than it has been for some time to build a globally consistent brand.”The years 2007-12 were a “golden age” for branded consumer products, as emerging markets expanded, says Mr Wilkinson. Since then, a cooling in many economies has made it harder to maintain profitable growth. Nonetheless, the combined value of the top 100 brands in 2015 grew 14 per cent from $2.9tn to $3.3tn compared with the previous year, the fastest rate for four years, beating the average growth of 9 per cent a year since the rankings began in 2006.During the recession, their combined value grew 8 per cent a year on average. The ranking combines financial measures with surveys of how consumers view brands.US brands achieved 19.1 per cent overall growth and accounted for the entire top 10, whereas growth in continental Europe was just 1.5 per cent, reflecting sluggishness in cars and luxury goods. The UK was down 4.2 per cent. Asian brands recovered by 24.7 per cent, despite the emerging market slowdown. This was driven in part by the entry of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company, at number 13 in the top 100, after its initial public offering. There were rises for Chinese portal Tencent, search engine Baidu and China Mobile. In 2006 there was just one Chinese brand (China Mobile) in the top 100; now there are 14.Technology continued to dominate the top 10 global brands. Apple recovered its number one slot with a 67 per cent rise in brand value to $247bn, having previously held it from 2011 to 2013. Its growth was powered by the iPhone 6. Google slipped to second, although its brand value rose 9 per cent to $174bn. Facebook was the fastest riser, up 99 per cent, followed by Apple and Intel. Microsoft, which is making it easier for developers to adapt apps to Windows, was up 28 per cent.Elspeth Cheung, global head of valuation for BrandZ, says technology companies are not only opening up their platforms, “they are trying to acquire a bigger slice of everyone’s life”. Apple is doing so through developments such as Apple Watch and the Apple Pay mobile payments venture. Google is looking beyond internet search to driverless cars, devices for the “smart home” and treatments associated with ageing.The technology category accounted for just under a fifth of the top 100 brands and nearly a third of the total value. There was 17 per cent growth in telecoms, 9 per cent in beer, 8 per cent in soft drinks, 4 per cent in fast food and 3 per cent in cars, but zero in apparel. Luxury goods, affected by the emerging markets slowdown, were down 6 per cent, with falls at Gucci and Hermès. Retail, excluding the Alibaba effect, was up 2 per cent.1/3Total value of the technology category in the top 100 brandsIn financial services, there was growth for insurance companies such as China Life and Ping An, and payments companies including PayPal and Visa. But global banks, down 2 per cent, continued to suffer the hangover from the financial crisis and multiple scandals.Since the BrandZ rankings began, only 58 companies have stayed in the top 100. Some analysts think volatility will increase as technology exerts its disruptive influence. This year, there are seven newcomers, more than the long-term average of four.These are: Alibaba, expanding in areas from taxi hailing to financial services; Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker challenging Apple and Samsung in premium smartphones; HDFC, the Indian bank; Telstra, the Australian telecoms company; Costco, the US retail warehouse; SoftBank, the Japanese telecoms company; and China Telecom.$3.3tnThe combined value of the top 100 brands in 2015Millward Brown says the share price of its BrandZ strong brands portfolio — up 102 per cent since 2006 — has outperformed the S&P 500 at 63 per cent and the MSCI World Index at 30 per cent. It attributes the difference to the “power of brands”.Brand managers face a more complex task, however, at a time when consumers judge products and services from what others say on social media rather than taking their cue from marketeers. They are also grappling with changing demographics, such as trying to tap into the power of older customers and understand the millennial generation’s shopping habits.“You’ve got to be thinking about change, about innovating and improving what you have,” says Mr Walshe.“It is about refining your brand proposition and making sure it is the best. It’s about paying attention to how consumers are using your product and the faster feedback that you get now. It’s about dealing with complaints honestly and quickly and not ignoring them.”Branding is becoming more of a factor in driving value and successMs Cheung says leaders need courage to act quickly, citing Chanel’s bold decision to cut its retail prices in Hong Kong and China and raise them in Europe to harmonise the regional price difference which allows unauthorised cross-border trading. Mr Wilkinson says, although in theory social media widen the scope for brands that offer a consistent global experience, consumers may think more locally, as in the example of craft beer.“You widen your net, but your advocacy group [of engaged consumers] may be recommending a certain real ale or craft lager from Bavaria rather than drinking Heineken,” he says. “There is an argument that social media will be damaging for global brands.”He adds that consumer products companies are having to make tougher choices about where to invest, because profits are not good enough to do everything. “You’ve got to make choices about whether to acquire or to innovate internally. You can’t invest everywhere, so where are the key markets? Are you going to do it with a global brand or something more locally relevant?”"
122;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Banks fight to repair damage to brands after financial crisis;After the banks, attention is now shifting to insurers;Few industries were left unscathed by the global financial crisis, but the banking sector was among the worst hit and is still nursing the wounds nearly seven years on.In the eyes of many, global investment banks conducting risky mortgage-backed trades were largely responsible for creating the crisis.As a consequence, consumer trust in the sector plunged. The past seven years have seen extensive regulation designed to clamp down on opaque investment banking practices, hitting profits and causing a number of lenders to retreat from the sector.While some banks have managed to salvage their brand, others have been permanently tainted.Royal Bank of Scotland, once the world’s biggest bank with assets of £2.4tn, has been forced to undertake a sweeping restructuring after seven successive years of net annual losses.The lender, bailed out by the UK government and still 80 per cent owned by taxpayers, recently unveiled plans to withdraw from global markets, cut its balance sheet by £65bn and radically shrink its investment banking arm.“One of the biggest losers is the RBS brand,” says James Daley, of consumer site Fairer Finance. “It has sunk to the bottom of [our] customer satisfaction tables over the past few years. It has gone from bad to worse, punctuated by an IT failure a few years ago, when people couldn’t get access to their cash.”Conversely, Santander has risen up the customer satisfaction tables. The bank benefited from the financial crisis in that it was able to acquire struggling lenders — such as Alliance & Leicester — cheaply. “The bank is now gaining customers for its current accounts and its customer rating is up from the bottom of the table where it languished six years ago,” says Mr Daley.Regional banks are also faring better than global “universal” banks that attempt to combine investment and retail banking.Millward Brown, the WPP research firm responsible for compiling the top 100 global brands list, believes regional banks are less subject to regulations and have forged better connections with consumers. HSBC’s brand value, for example, has slipped 11 per cent compared with last year, while Wells Fargo, a US retail bank, is up 9 per cent.But all banks face the threat of being disrupted by technology groups such as Apple and Google, which are moving into payments and making banking easier for consumers ever more reliant on mobile devices. Visa, for example, has seen its brand value soar 16 per cent over the past year, making it the most valuable financial services brand globally. However, experts believe the card provider must evolve to survive in an increasingly digitally focused world.John Lunn, a partner at business consultancy firm Moorhouse, believes the move to digital is tough for card providers, because “they are so heavily dependent on plastic”, such as credit and debit cards, as the core of their business.Christophe Duthoit, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group says: “The real question is: how do you transform an existing bank to make it more digital? The kind of customer experience offered by technology groups such as Google and Amazon is unparalleled by banks. They need to adapt and transform to offer a similar digital customer experience.”Insurance firms have had less of a torrid time, by comparison. “In the UK market, the insurance sector has been ‘steady as she goes’, especially in the general insurance market, where a lot of it is driven by price and scale,” says Mr Daley.He notes that Admiral and Direct Line continue to be two of the most profitable general insurers. “Aviva and Prudential are a bit more complex. They were steady until this year, when [UK] Budget reforms have thrown things into the air. But in terms of the financial crisis, they emerged relatively unscathed.”However, the insurance market experienced turmoil in 2008 when the US government was forced to bail out AIG in a $182bn rescue deal.After years of clamping down on banks, regulatory scrutiny is starting to shift towards the insurance sector. The Financial Conduct Authority earlier this month revealed shortcomings in the insurance market following a wide-ranging review.The watchdog said insurers are “not always providing customers with clear information about different payment options” when they buy general insurance products.“We have not scratched the surface of the insurance market yet because new regulations are about to bite,” says Richard Goold, a partner at Moorhouse.As one of the oldest private sector banks in India, HDFC is well known in the country.Its domestic focus and lack of international presence helped the bank emerge from the financial crisis unscathed, as India proved more resilient than other countries amid the global economic turmoil.The bank was launched in 1994 by its parent company, the Housing Development Finance Corporation, when the Indian government opened the market for private sector bank licences.With more than 3,600 branches in India and a balance sheet of about $100bn, it is one of the largest private sector banks in the country. The parent company retains a 20 per cent stake in the bank, while the remainder is owned by institutional investors.Aditya Narain, head of research for India at Citigroup, says it has “had a strong run” over the past 20 years, offering both corporate and retail loans in equal measures. “It is a high-quality bank in terms of quality assets.”The bank provides regular deposits, money transfers and business financing. This “plain vanilla business” is one of the reasons the bank was largely unaffected by the financial crisis, says Mr Narain. Indeed, its brand has entered the BrandZ top 100 global brands index for the first time, ranking 74 in terms of value.Regional banks have generally fared better in terms of brand value than global lenders, as they were more susceptible to the economic downturn. Part of the reason why the Indian banking system has weathered the storm is its strong regulatory framework, requiring banks to hold substantial cash and government bond buffers.Analysts at Barclays believe that HDFC in particular is “very well positioned”, with increased investment spending by the bank on growing its infrastructure, a strong balance sheet and deposit franchise.HDFC Bank is expanding its branch network, with 355 added in the fourth quarter of last year alone, which analysts believe “bodes well for future growth”. It is also noted for being the first in India to enter new geographical markets and sectors, such as digital banking.It claims to have been the first bank in India to launch international debit cards, as well as mobile banking and retail silver bars. Developing a strong domestic customer base is central to brand value.The bank has focused on expanding its reach across India, forging a partnership with the country’s Postal Department in 2008 to push into more rural locations. This is in stark contrast to UK banks, which are retrenching to save on costs.Barclays says HDFC is poised to benefit from a market recovery due to its robust financial position, especially as it continues to expand its presence and brand into semiurban areas.
123;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
124;V;Visa Inc;2015-05-08T22:06:45Z;Visa in talks to buy former European unit;Deal could be worth as much as $20bn but gap over price is wide;Visa Inc is in early-stage talks to buy its former European subsidiary in a deal that could be worth as much as $20bn, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.The world’s largest electronic payments company has tried buying Visa Europe before but failed to reach an agreement with the more than 3,000 banks that control it.A person familiar with the matter stressed that the talks were at a preliminary stage and there was no certainty that an agreement could be reached.The two sides are still discussing how to hammer out a deal and the divergence over the pricing remains wide, said one person.The range being discussed is $15bn to $20bn, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the talks between the two companies.Visa Europe has a put option, which can be exercised at any time, and requires the US company to purchase it at an agreed multiple of earnings within 285 days. Meanwhile, Visa Inc has a call option, enabling it to purchase Visa Europe if the company’s performance declines and hits certain thresholds, although the US group describes that eventuality as “remote”.In a filing in April, Visa said: “Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10bn. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or by undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment.“The amount of this potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised.” The put option provides for an arbitration process if the two sides cannot agree on the price.In February, Charlie Scharf, chief executive of Visa, was asked about the likelihood of a deal. “I have no idea,” he said. “We’ve got an extraordinarily close day-to-day working relationship with Visa Europe because we share the same brand, we share global customers. We’re working probably more closely than we ever have. So in the marketplace, we do appear as one company.”He added: “Relative to the fact that we are two separate entities, they need 80 per cent of their board to actually vote to put. And I’m not on their board. I don’t sit there. So I don’t know the dynamics. And they’ll make that decision and we’ll know when they make the decision. And until that point, it’s all speculation.”
125;V;Visa Inc;2015-04-08T10:44:47Z;Carmakers hunt for share of the mobile wallet market;Retailers and tech companies are showing interest in helping to develop dashboard apps;The Visa executive slips into the front seat of a new BMW, wakes up the tablet computer in the dashboard, and orders pizza. A few taps later and his lunch will be ready in 10 minutes at a nearby Pizza Hut. No need to pay at the restaurant — the car’s computer already did that for him.Smartphones and, soon, Apple Watches can already function as quasi-wallets, able to store credit and debit card details that can be used to pay for goods in stores. The car is the next frontier, according to technology and payment executives.“One car executive called me and said, ‘We really want to make the car your wallet’,” says Doug Brown, head of mobile for FIS, a maker of banking and payments software.Thanks in part to the launch of Apple’s mobile payment app Apple Pay, retailers and shoppers are increasingly using mobile payments, industry members say. That is leading to greater interest from merchants and tech companies in developing new ways to buy goods, including car dashboard apps.The revolution in mobile payments happens to coincide with a race by car and tech giants to make cars smarter. Consumers increasingly want their cars to have the same sophisticated technology, such as maps and music apps, as their smartphones.Most new cars have minicomputers embedded in dashboards that can run apps or link up with smartphones to let drivers control their phones through the car’s touchscreen. Apple and Google have both released software for cars in the past two years, while manufacturers from Detroit to Tokyo are developing in-house connected car systems.“This is where you start to get the pieces coming together,” says Ramón Martín, Visa’s global head of merchant solutions. “New commerce opportunities exist.”The Pizza Hut and Visa app, demonstrated at a recent industry conference in San Francisco, will soon roll out for beta testing in northern California. Ford last year launched a similar partnership with pizza chain Domino’s, which lets drivers order pizza using a voice-activated app in their car.“It makes you like Ford cars and Lincoln cars better because you’re not fumbling with your phone,” says Doug VanDagens, Ford’s director of connected services.As the automobile becomes smarter, makers face a future where profits lie in technology more than metalContinue readingA variety of other uses for in-car payments are in development, including a system that integrates in-app payments with location sensors to let drivers pay for petrol through a car app.But not everyone is sold on the idea that consumers want in-car payments.Kebbie Sebastian, managing director of Penser Consulting, a payments consulting firm, says smartphones are ubiquitous and already carry most of the apps that the auto and payments industries are looking to integrate into dashboards.“Paying from a car dashboard might be innovative but it isn’t any more convenient than paying from a smartphone,” says Mr Sebastian.Mr VanDagens says companies like Ford are trying to make it more convenient by building car-specific app interfaces that are easy to operate while driving, such as voice-controlled apps or apps with simplified menus.If they can get drivers using dashboard apps, they can remove the distraction of using a smartphone while driving. Ecommerce apps, for example, are hugely popular, but any in-car commerce app will “absolutely not”, he says, include features related to flash sales or time-sensitive online auctions.Those, Ford has decided, are too distracting.
126;V;Visa Inc;2015-03-30T19:04:03Z;Vodafone to add bank cards to mobile wallet service;App will be supported on a wide range of Android smartphones, but not on Apple’s iPhones;Vodafone will add bank cards to its mobile payments service following an agreement with Visa and Carta WorldwideFrom next week, bank card payments will be enabled for Vodafone Wallet in European markets including Italy, Germany, Spain, the UK and the Netherlands.The service will be supported on a wide range of Android smartphones, but not on Apple’s iPhones.Mark Ritzmann, head of commerce at Vodafone group, said: “Customers will be able to add payment cards to their Vodafone Wallet and use Android smartphones to pay at contactless terminals.”To use the service, customers will need to input their bank card details into the Vodafone Wallet app, and then confirm ownership of the card using Visa’s authentication process. Payments will be automatically debited from the cards.Both Apple and Google, as well as financial services companies, offer rival systems that allow people to pay using their phones. Apple Pay launched its own payments system for customers to use through iTunes last year.Google has its own service, which is also called Wallet.But telecoms operators see a key role in this market as providers of the mobile service, as well as often the smartphone itself. They say security is also tighter because it uses the Sim card, which can store customer’s personal information and card details.The Vodafone Wallet, an app that lets people pay for goods and services using mobile devices at contactless terminals, was launched in Europe in 2013.Vodafone is adding additional capabilities to its platform, which can already be used by third-party loyalty card companies, person-to-person payments between customers and to pay for services such as travel on London Underground.On Monday, the company also said that Mathias Döpfner, Axel Springer chief executive, would become a non-executive director of the British telecoms group.Gerard Kleisterlee, Vodafone chairman, described Mr Döpfner as “one of the leading visionaries of the global media industry who has led his business through a highly successful transition into digital and international markets”.Separately, Vodafone announced that Luc Vandevelde, the former chairman of Carrefour and Marks and Spencer, would stand down from the board this summer.
127;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Facebook enters money transfer market;Messenger app could compete with PayPal, Square and large banks;Facebook users will now be able to send money to their friends using its Messenger app, the social network’s first foray into peer-to-peer money transfer.The Silicon Valley company will compete with payments providers such as PayPal and Square, and potentially large banks, after it announced that users will be able to upload a Visa or MasterCard debit card to their Messenger app to send payments to their Facebook friends for free.In a product that appears similar to Paypal’s popular Venmo app, US users of Facebook will be able to send money from Apple and Android devices and desktop computers in the coming months.The company stressed it had enabled security features including a PIN and touch ID on iOS devices, after Venmo was accused of making it easy for fraudsters to steal from a users’ bank account.“We use layers of software and hardware protection that meet the highest industry standards,” Facebook said in a blog post. “These payment systems are kept in a secured environment that is separate from other parts of the Facebook network and that receives additional monitoring and control. A team of anti-fraud specialists monitor for suspicious purchase activity to help keep accounts safe.”Facebook is the latest technology company to try to enter the financial sector, after Apple launched its payment service Apple Pay last year and Google rolled out Google Wallet.It hired David Marcus, president of eBay’s PayPal unit, to run its Facebook Messenger division last year, as it searched for a way to generate revenue from the app. Facebook generates the vast majority of its revenue from advertising, which some analysts worried could be intrusive on a more personal one-to-one experience like messaging.Any solution found for Facebook Messenger could also be rolled out across WhatsApp, the SMS-style messaging app that Facebook bought for $22bn last year.The Financial Times reported last spring that Facebook was readying itself to provide financial services in the form of remittances and electronic money. The company discussed partnerships with at least three London-based start-ups that offer international money transfers, which could prove popular with Facebook and WhatsApp’s large international audience.Facebook has long had a payments business where it stored card data so that users could pay for extra features in games that run on the platform. It already had a range of money transfer licences in the US and applied last year to become an “e-money” institution in Ireland, where its European headquarters are.Twitter has also experimented with person-to-person money transfer, with a partnership in France that enabled users to tweet cash to their followers. S-money, a division of Groupe BPCE, the second-largest French banking group by customers, teamed up with Twitter to offer the service last autumn. But the company has not formed similar partnerships in other markets.

129;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Monitise considers sale on revenue warning;Aim-listed mobile payments group calls in advisers;"Monitise, the UK mobile payments company, has issued its third revenue warning in a year and appointed advisers to consider strategic options including a sale of the business and a re-listing in the US, as the group struggles with painful changes to its business model.The former highflying tech group said on Thursday it expected revenues for 2015 to be flat at £90m-£100m, rather than growing 25 per cent to £119m, as originally projected. Losses were forecast to be £40-£50m, wider than previous estimates.The news caps a tumultuous year for Aim-quoted Monitise, a lossmaking company listed on London’s junior market that sells mobile banking software. Its founder and co-chief executive, Alastair Lukies, is a former rugby player who is close to Prime Minister David Cameron, and has been feted for his services to the UK’s emerging “financial technology” sector.Monitise has become a posterchild for the ups and downs of the UK tech sector, where some privately-held start-ups are drawing big investor excitement even as other groups on London’s junior market have struggled.Shares in the mobile payments company have lost 80 per cent of their value over the past 12 months as the company shifted its strategy from building apps to becoming a next-generation platform that connects banks with retailers and telecommunications groups.As a result, revenues from software licences halved in the last six months of 2014 to £4.4m compared with the preceding six months, and development and integration sales declined 13 per cent. Subscription and transaction revenues for its platform increased just 8 per cent to £16.2m.The fall in licences and sales comes after the company spent much of the past year trying to clean up the balance sheet, including calling on shareholders for cash – first £100m in March and then £49.2m in November, both at steep premiums to the 15p at which their shares are currently trading.If the company were to sell at a lower valuation than prior investment, it is likely to unsettle some investors. “If I were a small shareholder in this company, I would be more than upset,” said Alexandre Faure, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.To shore up confidence, the company has recruited new names to the boardroom, including Visa Inc executive Elizabeth Buse, who joined Mr Lukies as co-chief executive in June. It has also cut costs, primarily via a partnership with IBM, in which Big Blue took on a fifth of Monitise’s staff, and offered Monitise access to its corporate client base.The group reiterates that it expects to be profitable by 2016, but there are obstacles to overcome.The move to a network model has pitted Monitise against tech companies which have the resources and financing to scale up quickly. Google, a pioneer in mobile payments, is now in talks to acquire payments group Softcard, while Appleunveiled Apple Pay last year.“When it comes to m-commerce, banks can’t do that on their own because there are so many different parties involved,” said Philip Carse, analyst at Megabuyte, a research group.Analysts say it is also facing competition from the banks, which now regard mobile technology as core parts of their businesses and are bringing more work in-house. HSBC, for example, has two apps – the simpler of which was built by Monitise, and the second, more extensive version it made itself.At the end of last year, Monitise struck deals that brought in Santander, Telefónica and MasterCard as major shareholders, but analysts question whether the company can garner a critical mass of customers to make its network capabilities valuable enough to offset the decline in licences. Visa itself, for instance, took several decades to develop its payments network.On Wednesday, the company said the number of registered end-users on its platform, a key metric for the new business model, rose 9 per cent to 33m between June and December last year.As well as private equity, Mr Faure said IBM could be a potential buyer if Monitise opts for a sale. He noted banking software vendors such as Oracle and Temenos could also be interested, despite both companies buying mobile assets several years ago.“They don’t need Monitise from a technology perspective; it’s more about their customer relationships, as Monitise is quite entrenched with UK banks,” Mr Faure said.The company’s shares closed down 25 per cent to 15p.Partnerships: far from plain sailingMonitise has used its relationships with big commercial partners as a way of explaining to investors how it will eventually profit from the rise of mobile banking.But as the company has moved from the increasingly competitive apps market to becoming a next-generation payments network, those relationships have not always been smooth or simple.Visa Inc: In 2009, the US payments network took a 15 per cent stake in Monitise and made minimum revenue commitments to buy software and integration services for the company. The aim was for Visa to sell Monitise’s mobile banking software to Visa’s small and midsized US banking clients.In June 2014, Monitise recruited former Visa payments executive Elizabeth Buse to join as co-chief executive. Just three months later Visa announced it would consider selling down its stake — which it did in December when the shares were trading at about 30p.Visa Europe: In 2011, Visa Europe, a separate business to Visa Inc that is owned by the big European banks, bought an 8.8 per cent stake in Monitise. It also committed to a minimum spend, and initially focused on software for peer-to-peer money transfer.At the time of the deal, Peter Ayliffe was chief executive at Visa Europe, and an advocate of Monitise, according to two people familiar with the company. After serving as a non-executive director of Monitise, Mr Ayliffe left Visa Europe in September 2013, and joined Monitise as its chairman later that month.Visa Europe still retains a nearly 5.5 per cent stake in Monitise, though the sale of Visa Inc’s stake has raised questions about the former’s intentions. Tom Houghton, chief payments officer at Visa Europe, sits on Monitise’s board as a non-executive director. Visa Europe declined to comment on its plans for the shareholding.IBM: In August 2014, Monitise trumpeted a new strategic partnership with IBM with the plan of selling its new platform technology to its top-tier client base. But the move was also a way of cutting costs, with the transfer of a fifth of its workforce to IBM.Santander, Telefónica and MasterCard: In November 2014, Monitise announced that these three groups would take an 8.2 per cent stake in the company. The move was described as an alliance of “strategic partners” that planned to “expand its commercial relationships” with Monitise as it built out its platform."
130;V;Visa Inc;2014-11-27T13:05:04Z;Monitise signs up Santander, Telefónica and MasterCard;Mobile money group unveils new partnerships month after Visa decided to sell stake in company;Monitise has struck deals that will see Santander, Telefónica and MasterCard become major shareholders in the British mobile money group, just weeks after long-time backer Visa revealed plans to sell its stake in the company.On Thursday, the banking, telecoms and credit card groups said they will invest £49.2m in Monitise between them, representing 8.2 per cent of the company’s existing share capital. Santander will buy shares worth 5.5 per cent of the existing share capital, Telefónica 2.2 per cent and MasterCard 0.5 per cent.The new investments amount to buying 161m new shares at Wednesday’s closing price of 30.5p per share. This group of “strategic partners” has also joined discussions to “expand its commercial relationships” with Monitise.The agreements will provide a welcome respite for the British technology start-up, which has seen its share price lose more than half of its value since January. In this time, it has been hit by two profit warnings, global nervousness over tech stocks and problems over a shift in business model. Last month, Visa, it’s fourth largest shareholder and long-time investor, said it had hired JPMorgan to advise on the potential sale of its 5.5 per cent stake in the company.Alastair Lukies, Monitise’s founder and co-chief executive and a former rugby star turned tech entrepreneur, said his strategy is to switch focus from a large number of small deals to pursuing bigger alliances to build a global platform.“This shows that we’re here to stay,” he said. “If you look at some of the commentary and shorting arguments, people have suggested we’re a busted flush . . . [but following the latest deals] there can be no question that we need to raise more capital. We’re debt free and have plenty of cash. 2015 should be, from a share price perspective, a really positive year as we continue to execute.”Dispatches from the tech world: FT experts in San Francisco, London and Taipei upload their viewsPeter Roe, research director at TechMarketView, the analyst group, cautioned the company must continue to seek more deals to maintain its goal to be profitable by 2016.“We want to see that Monitise is building momentum, with a drumbeat of good announcements and a building of confidence that shows the company is building scale and really seizing the opportunity,” he said.In August, Monitise announced a deal with IBM that opens access to Big Blue’s corporate client base. That agreement also included the transfer of about 200 workers to the US tech conglomerate. On Thursday, IBM also agreed to expand this relationship by using its artificial intelligence engine Watson to support Monitise’s mobile money technology.Monitise, which listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market in 2007, has 30m registered users, via customers such as HSBC and RBS. It builds banking and payment apps, as well as software that lets different financial institutions talk to one another in order to facilitate mobile transactions. It likens itself to a next-generation Link, the organisation that co-ordinates ATMs in the UK.The company has undergone a major transformation in recent months. It has taken a number of steps to shift from a licence business model, which required its customers to pay a large upfront fee, to a subscription-based model.Monitise has also made changes to its board, as well as recruiting two Visa executives: Elizabeth Buse joined as co-chief executive in June, and Mike Dreyer, Visa’s former global head of technology, was appointed president for the Americas this month.

Sales climbed 13 per cent to $2.5bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of 78 cents a share, on revenue of $2.45bn.Revenue climbed on the back of an increase in cross-border volume fees and transaction processing fees.On Thursday, the State Council in China said it would allow foreign companies to clear electronic payments, which was welcome news for MasterCard and Visa.“Although MasterCard was pleased with reports that China plans to open up their domestic processing market, this is only the first of many steps needed to get MasterCard access to this market, while the regulatory framework and timing surrounding this initiative require more clarity,” Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies, said.Shares of MasterCard climbed 9 per cent to $83.13 and are down 3 per cent so far this year.Shares of Lakeland Industries, maker of protective suits used by healthcare workers treating Ebola, surged 23 per cent to $14.24.The company said on Wednesday that it had received orders for 1m suits, with additional orders for other protective gear such as foot coverings and gloves.The company said it would increase manufacturing capacity for its suits after “experiencing significant interest globally for its ChemMAX and MicroMAX protective suit lines”.It expects monthly production capacity for the suit lines to increase 100 per cent by January 2015, after having increased 50 per cent from August to October this year.Shares in Lakeland are up more than 200 per cent this year.Shares of DreamWorks Animation fell more than 5 per cent to $22.03 despite an earnings beat.The company reported net income of $11.9m or 14 cents a share, compared with $10.0m or 12 cents a share a year ago. Sales climbed 17 per cent to $180.9m.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of 5 cents a share, on sales of $184.4m.Drew Borst, an analyst at Goldman Sachs said, said: “DreamWorks Animation remains in transition with a goal of diversifying away from feature films by expanding into related business, such as TV production, location-based entertainment and consumer products. As a result, operating expense continues to rise and considerably faster than we expected.”Meanwhile, analysts at Janney Montgomery downgraded their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy” while maintaining their $27 price target.Visa shares climbed 10 per cent to $236.65, leading the S&P 500, after the company beat fourth-quarter profit estimates and unveiled a $5bn share buyback programme on Wednesday.US stocks were muted after the Federal Reserve set a more hawkish tone at its meeting on Wednesday, and following a better than expected 3.5 per cent rise in third-quarter US GDP.But the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a price-weighted index, was led higher by Visa, its biggest constituent.The benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.6 per cent to 1,994.64, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 17,195.42.

132;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Visa/MasterCard: growth is priceless;The future looks bright for Visa and MasterCard;At times you just need one good day to recover from a disastrous year. Football strikers know that (just ask Liverpool’s Mario Balotelli). MasterCard and Visa do too, now. Better-than-expected quarterly numbers and a robust outlook lifted shares in the two payment processors by nearly a tenth. After an uninspiring year, their share prices are now almost back to where they were in January. True, share price performance is not just about quarterly results. But their future looks bright.The US economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.5 per cent in the third quarter and the Federal Reserve has enough confidence to end quantitative easing. So consumers should have a renewed appetite for spending money. Visa and MasterCard expect payment volumes to grow by more than 10 per cent both this year and next.There have been concerns about challenges from the likes of Apple Pay. The new iPhone allows customers to use mobiles to pay for in-store products instead of cash or cards. But this is no threat to MasterCard and Visa – payments on Apple Pay still go through their cards, but in a digital form.Apple provides the slick, consumer-friendly platform that the card companies were unable to create. Apple does this for a fee but the card companies save the investment they would have had to make in building a platform themselves. The Silicon Valley threat has been overstated.China’s move to open up its domestic electronic payment market to foreign companies could be a bigger deal for MasterCard and Visa, if it happens. According to Nilson Report, Union Pay (the leading credit and debit card player in China) processes about $5tn worth of transactions each year. Add that to the fact that a large portion of China’s 1.3bn population has no or very basic access to banking services, and the potential for expansion is enormous. The challenge for the payment companies is to address the emerging markets profitably. Concerns about Brazil and Russia were behind their shares’ price fall earlier this year.Still, Visa and MasterCard look well set for the next few decades. Regardless of good or bad quarters, with 85 per cent of the world’s transactions still happening on paper, there are many growth opportunities. The valuation about 20 times next year’s forward earnings makes the two look expensive. Growth, it seems, is priceless.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
133;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;China to open bank cards to foreign competition;Policy shift opens door for Visa, MasterCard;China will allow foreign companies to clear electronic payments in its domestic market, its cabinet said on Thursday, opening the door for Visa and MasterCard to compete with the dominant state-owned champion.The World Trade Organisation ruled in 2012 that China unfairly discriminated against foreign electronic payment processors who wanted to process renminbi transactions, handing a victory to the US, which brought the complaint.Central bank rules require all payment cards – including debit and credit cards – to clear renminbi transactions through China UnionPay, a clearing network owned by 85 mostly state-owned banks. But in a statement, the State Council signalled a cautious shift.“In order to expand financial openness, promote innovative development of the domestic bank card and payment markets . . . foreign and domestically invested enterprises that meet requirements can all apply to establish bank card settlement organisations,” the State Council said, without referencing the WTO ruling.Many Chinese banks issue credit cards bearing the UnionPay logo alongside either Visa, MasterCard or American Express. UnionPay clears renminbi payments made with these cards, while the other systems are used for foreign currency payments.“One era ends, a new era begins. Opening up the payment clearing market is not only a WTO requirement, it’s also the necessary next step for an industry that has developed up to a certain point,” said Tang Bing, chief executive of Yeepay.com, a Beijing-based payment processor.Still, the extent to which foreign companies will be able to compete with UnionPay depends on implementation. In China’s policy making process, the State Council issues broad guidelines, leaving specific agencies to follow up with specific regulations. Even after the WTO ruling, the People’s Bank of China last year blocked a local online payment platform from issuing renminbi-settled credit cards in partnership with MasterCard.“If the policy can be smoothly and quickly implemented, it’s great for the industry. Merchants and users can expect higher quality and more diversified payment clearing service,” said Mr Tang.The market potential for foreign companies is enormous. Chinese consumers long favoured cash transactions, but that has changed in recent years. UnionPay bank card transactions hit Rmb21.8trn ($3.6tn) in 2012, up 37 per cent from 2011, and had issued more than 3.5bn cards.Still, UnionPay will remain a formidable competitor. Founded in 2002, its chairman until Thursday was Su Ning, a former central bank vice governor. But on the same day that the cabinet announced the policy, UnionPay’s website quietly changed the list of its senior executives, replacing Mr Su’s name with Ge Huayong, another former central banker and recently UnionPay’s vice-chairman.UnionPay did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Additional reporting by Ma Nan in Shanghai

Most of the disrupters are great enablers for consumers, merchants and our industry,” said Mr Scharf. “Apple is the first great example.”Visa reported that net income fell from $1.2bn in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $1.1bn. Stripping out a $283m litigation provision, net income was $1.4bn, or $2.18 a share, which compared with analysts’ expectations of $2.11.The provision was for continued legal action with a minority of merchants who declined to be part of a 2013 $5.7bn settlement over claims that credit card swipe fees were improperly charged.Announcing the share buyback, Mr Scharf said: “Given the opportunities in the payment space, we will continue to look for and prioritise growth opportunities.”The news comes on the heels of IBM adding $5bn to its share buyback programme and Micron Technology unveiling a $1bn buyback.Mr Scharf highlighted setbacks, including in Russia where President Vladimir Putin has signed a law to make a Russian central bank-owned processor take over work from Visa.“Russia continues to move towards its goal of controlling domestic processing,” said Mr Scharf. He said the company would lose about $70m in revenues as a result, but added: “We continue to believe we will play an important role in Russia.”Brazil was a “complicated market”, Mr Scharf said, “given the elections and the recently implemented cross-border taxes but we continue to grow relationships there as well”.
135;V;Visa Inc;2014-09-24T09:01:35Z;After the sanctions, prepare for the Russian counterattack;Moscow’s entanglements allow it to exact a price of its own, writes Juan Zarate;For all the costs that sanctions are inflicting on the Russian economy, the Russian flag still flies over Crimea, Moscow remains undeterred and the ceasefire in Ukraine is at risk. Worse still, Russia is using its own form of economic warfare as a shield and a sword.Western strategy has focused on blocking future deals with the Russian military sector, restricting Russian banks’ access to long-term capital, depriving elements of the Russian oil sector of technology they need for deep sea and shale drilling, and freezing the overseas assets of individuals tied to the Kremlin.But most existing contracts between western interests and their Russian clients have been allowed to continue. Rather than dealing an instant blow, the aim has been to starve the country of capital by sowing doubts among western investors about the wisdom of investing in Russia. Contracts and capital have evaporated, growth has slowed and major Russian companies such as Aeroflot have been unable to acquire necessary investment.But there is a limit to the amount of financial pain that the west can inflict on a major economy with substantial economic ties to Europe and the rest of the world. Russia’s entanglements are vulnerabilities but they also allow Russia to exact a price of its own.Companies subject to western sanctions are making moves to circumvent the restrictions. Rosneft, the Russian oil company, is set to buy 30 per cent of Norway’s north Atlantic Drilling, enabling it to access offshore drilling capabilities in the Arctic despite technology export bans and financial restrictions.Meanwhile, Russian investors deepen their economic interests in London, Frankfurt and New York. And the Russian sovereign wealth fund will be tapped for billions of dollars to shore up necessary capital requirements for its banks hit by sanctions.Sep 5, 2014: The EU is working on barring Russia’s state-controlled oil companies from raising funds on European capital markets. Lex contributors Joseph Cotterill and Alan Livsey discuss Rosneft.Watch the videoMoscow is biting back. In June it ended flows of oil and gas to Ukraine, and it is restricting exports to other European customers as winter approaches. The Kremlin has banned agricultural imports from countries that have participated in the sanctions. It has closed four McDonald’s restaurants, using health inspections as a pretext, and it is flirting with a national payment system that could replace Visa and MasterCard. Western airlines may find themselves unable to fly over Siberia, forcing flights to Asia to take big detours. American consulting and accounting firms may be prevented from operating in Russia.Russia has more cards to play. It could cut off supplies of engines to the US space programme. It is a big exporter of titanium and other resources needed by western companies. Moscow could emerge as a sanctions-busting financial partner to a country such as Iran, at the height of nuclear negotiations. The Kremlin could also enlist criminal networks to attack the computer systems of western targets, including major banks.The west needs a comprehensive strategy that intensifies financial pressure on Moscow while deterring Russian escalation. Sanctions should no longer be tied to diplomatic milestones. Instead, they should be seen as a continuous campaign that leaves Mr Putin and the markets guessing. This approach has proved highly effective in Iran.New Russian investments in the west need to be carefully scrutinised and western commercial contacts with suspect individuals and companies further constrained. Europe needs to secure alternative sources of oil and gas, though this will take time. Other countries, too, should seek back-up supplies of resources they buy from Russia.Unless Washington and Brussels are willing to endure some economic pain, their sanctions campaign will prove ineffective. They should be prepared for a frozen conflict in which Moscow is willing to use its own economic weapons.The writer is author of ‘Treasury’s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare’
136;V;Visa Inc;2014-09-18T09:39:15Z;Monitise shares fall as Visa considers stake sale;;Shares in Monitise lost a quarter of their value on Thursday morning after Visa said it was “considering its options” on its 5.5 per cent holding in the high-profile UK tech group.The global card payments group took a near 15 per cent stake in Monitise in 2009 and established a commercial partnership with the Aim-quoted mobile banking software group, under which it would provide Visa with platform development services until the end of 2016.But the Californian company’s stake in Monitise has gradually been diluted down to 5.5 per cent and Visa is seeking to bring more of its mobile development resources in-house. Visa said on Thursday morning it had appointed JPMorgan to advise on its options regarding the Monitise stake.The news caps a difficult few days for Monitise, set up in 2003 by former Saracens and London Irish rugby player Alastair Lukies. Results for the year to the end of June this week showed a 30 per cent increase in full-year sales, but losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew at double the rate – widening by 62.5 per cent to £31.4m.Considered one of the high-flyers of the UK tech scene, Monitise is attempting to revolutionise the evolving mobile payments industry and bring big banks into the digital age.As well as its partnership with Visa, it has also signed strategic agreements with Santander – the largest bank in the eurozone by market capitalisation – and Visa’s rival, MasterCard.Monitise, which floated on London’s junior market in 2007, is considering a move to the main London market. It has overhauled its board in recent months, recruiting two Visa executives – Elizabeth Buse, who joined as co-chief executive in June, and Mike Dreyer, Visa’s global head of technology, who was appointed president for the Americas this month.Monitise’s shares were down 22 per cent at 33¼p at midday in London on Thursday. The shares have fallen more than 60 per cent since reaching an all-time peak of 81p in January.The company has been knocked this year by global nervousness over tech stocks, as well as two profit warnings. The company announced in March that it would shift from a licence business model, which required its customers to pay a large upfront fee, to a subscription-based model that would reduce costs.At the time of publication, the company had yet to respond to a request for comment.
137;V;Visa Inc;2014-09-09T22:52:39Z;Apple looks to swipe the payments market;;Apple has taken aim at the credit card’s five decades-old magnetic strip, promising to overhaul an “antiquated” US payments system by letting customers pay for transactions with their iPhones.“Payments is a huge business,” Tim Cook, chief executive, told an Apple product launch event on Tuesday. “We’ve created an entirely new payment process.”The California-based company has previously upended industries from music to mobile phones and, with other prominent technology companies such as Google and Facebook, is considered a threat by the biggest US banks.“[They] all want to eat our lunch,” Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in February. “I mean every single one of them, and they’re going to try.”Despite that wariness, Apple’s clout was enough for banks and payments companies to send senior executives to Silicon Valley for the unveiling of a product that will launch in October.Gordon Smith, JPMorgan’s consumer head, was in attendance, and there was none of the previous wariness from his boss. “Everyone wins,” said Mr Dimon in one of a series of glowing statements from bank CEOs.Although no details were forthcoming, banks said they were having to give up some of their fees for processing transactions to Apple.The biggest US banks including Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase and Barclays as well as credit card companies MasterCard, Visa and American Express are part of the Apple Pay service, representing 83 per cent of total US payment volume.“We’ve tested lots of different wallet solutions and investigated many many others, this really was the best one that focused on the customer,” said Jim Smith, head of virtual channels at Wells Fargo.For all the hoopla, analysts noted that the near field communication (NFC) technology was already in use by companies such as Google and had failed to take off in the US, though it is more popular in some Asian and European countries.Daniel Thomas says customers will still buy into Apple lifestyleIt was also unclear whether Apple Pay would be widely adopted by retailers, some of the biggest of which are developing their own mobile payment technology.“NFC payments are failing here in the US,” said Tom Noyes, managing partner of Starpoint LLC, a mobile payments company, and former Citigroup executive. “What we saw in Citi in every country we launched this, for the first few months every consumer wanted to test it out but after that they forget about it and it does nothing differently to your card.”Although Apple announced some retail partners – including Macy’s and McDonald’s – some of the country’s biggest were absent. Mr Noyes said retailers were reluctant to sign up, partly because Apple Pay might trigger more use of credit cards, which impose more costs on merchants.We’ve tested lots of different wallet solutions and investigated many many others, this really was the best one that focused on the customer“What Apple has announced today is essentially an acceleration in the extinction in the physical card,” said Jason Oxman, chief executive of the Electronic Transactions Association, an industry group.He added: “Cynicism is well placed in that Apple did not announce anything new, but what they announced is that Apple is doing something – they didn’t invent the smartphone, they didn’t invent the tablet, they just designed it and deployed it better than anyone else,” he said.The new system is available on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Apple Watch. The customer takes a photo of their card on their phone and then verifies the card with the bank. They can then hold their device near to a contactless reader and verify payments with their finger using Apple’s Touch ID system.Data security was high on the agenda, with Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of software and services, telling the audience Apple would not store credit card numbers or give them to merchants.The US has the world’s biggest fraud problem, with losses up 14.5 per cent to $5.3bn in 2012, according to The Nilson Report. Retailers and banks, which have suffered from high-profile bulk hacking of credit card information, are attracted to the fact that Apple Pay does not transmit the credit card number.“That card information will be replaced with a single-use token,” said Eileen Serra, head of card services at JPMorgan.Ms Serra suggested that the biggest advantage of Apple Pay might not be in stores but for online shopping, where the need to type in credit card information and shipping addresses is an annoyance for consumers. “While online commerce is growing, that’s where the friction is most severe,” she said.
138;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;NXP Semiconductors: extra chips with that;If magnetic strip credit cards soon go the way of the dodobird, NXP is a very good bet;"When the iPhone 6 launches, spare a thought for what lies inside: the processors, the sensors, the microphones. Some 400 components are in an iPhone, and manufacturers jostle to join the Apple supply chain. One of the biggest winners this time should be NXP Semiconductors. Its share price has nearly doubled in the past 12 months.The iPhone 6 could be hugely significant for NXP, beyond sales of commoditised NFC chips, if Apple can create a world of mobile payments. IHS calculates NXP’s bill of materials for the new iPhones could be nearly double that of the iPhone 5s, if it wins the NFC slot and maintains its other design slots.NXP should benefit because it is the world’s biggest producer of secure NFC chips and of the chip cards commonly used in Europe under the Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) standard. NXP already makes three-quarters of the chips in EMV cards, a semi market that could double between 2014 and 2018, Barclays estimates. EMV and NFC chips go hand in hand because when retail stores upgrade to accept one, they often accept the other. The US has so far been slow to adopt advanced payment systems (such as chip cards); the question is whether Apple’s push will succeed in getting retailers and customers to switch to contactless payments.NXP expects a near-term revenue boost of 11 per cent sequential growth this quarter. Growth looks set to continue: Gartner forecasts payments processed by NFC chips will grow 64 per cent a year on average between 2010 and 2017. Is this already priced in? At $71, NXP is trading 15 times forward earnings, with revenues growing 16 per cent a year. Not exactly cheap – but in line with other Apple suppliers such as Qualcomm (14 times) or Broadcom (15 times). If magnetic strip credit cards soon go the way of the dodo, NXP is a very good bet.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
139;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Vodafone to launch UK mobile payments;Partnership with Visa will see telecoms group take on Apple;Vodafone will launch a mobile wallet service in the UK next month into a market set to be shaken up by Apple’s plans for a payments platform.The British mobile group has developed its own service with Visa that will work with a special SIM card embedded with NFC (near field communication) technology that can be used to swipe for payments at contactless tills.Vodafone is working with third-party loyalty card companies such as Nectar, and will open up the technology to banks to use with their own payment services. The Vodafone wallet can also be used to pay for travel on London Underground, and will allow person-to-person payments between customers.Vodafone is planning a consumer launch later this year for the service. But it will probably be beaten to the market by Apple, which is expected to integrate mobile payments into its forthcoming range of iPhones, due to be unveiled this week. Vodafone’s mobile application will only be available on Android smartphones.“The pieces are falling into place,” said Alix Pryde, head of innovation at Vodafone UK. “There are now the devices, the contactless payments and increasingly the consumer behaviour to make this a success.”The group has already launched similar services in Italy, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. It said that the take-up had met its expectations so far.Mobile operators are competing with technology companies as well as financial services groups to take the lead in mobile payments as more people become reliant on smartphones for a range of lifestyle services.They can offer a level of security through their ownership of the SIM card, where the customer’s personal information and card details can be stored securely. But banks have a brand loyalty around payments that no mobile operator can match, while Apple’s solution is expected to use a secure chip and will be able to interact with customers through iTunes.Vodafone customers will need to replace existing SIMs for NFC-enabled versions and have a compatible handset. Mark Ritzmann, head of m-commerce, said usage would be restricted to payments below £25 for regulatory reasons, although he added that the company hoped to introduce a PIN-protected way to make larger payments in time. “It will start to replace the leather wallet,” he added.Vodafone said that more than 300,000 terminals had so far been enabled for Visa contactless payments, a 67 per cent increase over last year, while there were about 111m contactless purchases in the UK in the 12 months to February 2014.
140;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Apple eyes pay-by-touch for next iPhone;;Apple is working with Dutch chipmaker NXP to add secure short-range wireless technology into the next iPhone, enabling new pay-by-touch capabilities in the latest bid for the smartphone to replace the wallet.Several people familiar with Apple’s plans say NXP will provide the secure near-field communications chips that will allow an iPhone to connect with payment terminals or ticketing systems, as well as opening up the possibility for other applications in the “internet of things”.NFC technology allows a smartphone to communicate wirelessly with other devices by tapping them together.On Thursday, Apple announced its plans for a product launch event on September 9 at which it is expected to unveil new iPhones. Apple and NXP both declined to comment on whether the new devices would contain the Dutch company’s NFC technology.Analysts say Apple could galvanise a smartphone payments market that has struggled to take off, even though tap-to-pay technology has been built into mobile devices for eight years. Thanks to iTunes and the App Store, Apple already holds credit card details for some 800m customers, giving it a potential advantage over the many earlier attempts at mobile payments. It has been recruiting executives with experience in mobile payments for the last several months in both Europe and the US.Nokia introduced the first NFC phone in 2006, while several smartphones from the likes of Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics have included the technology since 2011. NXP also supplies NFC chips for some of Samsung’s flagship Galaxy phones.So far the iPhone has been a holdout, leaving only half of US smartphones equipped with NFC today, according to Jackdaw Research.Google, whose Android operating system powers Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones, tried to kick-start the market for NFC-based payments in 2011 with its Wallet app, allowing customers to transact through dedicated terminals at US stores and restaurants.But while NFC phones have become popular in some markets such as Japan, where they are widely used to make payments on public transport, the plastic credit card has so far remained stubbornly resistant to technological disruption.Dispatches from the tech world: FT experts in San Francisco, London and Taipei upload their viewsAdoption of Google Wallet in the US remains limited and other efforts to persuade customers to use their smartphones for payments, such as Square’s Wallet app, PayPal and telecoms joint-venture Isis also remain at an early stage.If Apple entered the market, “millions of consumers in the US would suddenly have a tightly integrated solution built into their devices,” said Jackdaw analyst Jan Dawson in a blogpost this week, although it would “still suffer – at least at first – from the same problem of a lack of terminals which could accept payments”.In parts of Europe and China, NFC-based credit cards are already used to pay for low-cost items such as sandwiches but the technology has been slower to catch on in the US. Apple’s arrival may come at an opportune moment, as US retailers prepare to upgrade their cashier terminals.Visa and MasterCard have set a deadline of October 2015 to switch from swipe-and-sign credit card payments to European-style chip-and-PIN terminals, many of which could also include NFC capabilities. Apple’s own retail stores already use handheld terminals equipped with NFC.In 2012, Apple was granted a significant patent for a sophisticated mobile payments system involving NFC. The patent submission suggested that iTunes could be used to manage credit card statements. The company has made several subsequent patent applications for components of a mobile payment system, some working in conjunction with iBeacon, its Bluetooth-based location-sensing technology.NXP is already a supplier to Apple in other areas. Its stock rose 2 per cent on Thursday after technology magazine Wired reported Apple’s plans for NFC, even without naming NXP as a supplier. Its market valuation on Nasdaq has increased by more than 50 per cent so far this year and now stands at almost $17bn.
141;V;Visa Inc;2014-08-13T12:36:15Z;Digital era brings hyperscale challenges;Huge companies that process billions of daily transactions pose problems for their leaders and competitors, write McKinsey’s James Manyika and Michael Chui;"What are the chances of being hit by lightning in any given year? It’s about one in a million, rare enough to think that it is near impossibility. But there are businesses that deal with one-in-a-million occurrences every day: hyperscale companies. As a business leader, you will have to think very differently if you are going to run one of these hyperscale businesses or compete against them.Even if these businesses use “six sigma” processes, described as being 99.9966 per cent defect-free, they will generate more than 3,000 problems from every billion transactions or processes they undertake. Such scale and complexity is almost unimaginable for most executives, but these are businesses that can sweep away old business models. If you face competition from a hyperscale business, be prepared for disruption.The internet and digitisation are clearly the main catalysts of the early hyperscale companies. Google processes 4bn searches per day. Twitter users tweet more than 500m times per day. Facebook has more than 1bn users, approaching the second-largest nation of earth. China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba conducts 200m transactions per week in the world’s fastest-growing e-commerce market.But even some traditional businesses fully enabled by digital technology are hitting hyperscale. China Mobile has more than 760m subscribers. Global payments networks run by Visa, MasterCard and Amex already process billions of consumer transactions per year. And as connected digital sensors and devices are embedded in the physical world – a trend described as “the internet of things” – even companies in traditional industries could face hyperscale challenges. GE and other large industrial companies are moving in this direction.Whether you are an entrepreneur, an investor, or a business leader, you must recognise the dawning of a new age of hyperscale businesses, and try to understand the unique management challenges and opportunities associated with them.We do not yet have a set of best practices about how to create and operate such a business. We are, nevertheless, starting to see some patterns in how they operate and the unique requirements for managing these businesses:Firstly, hyperscale businesses exhibit hypergrowth, at least at some stage of their development. WeChat, the mobile text and voice messaging communication service developed by China’s Tencent, added 300m users in two years, more than the entire adult population of the US. To sustain hypergrowth, you must offer value propositions that will resonate worldwide, invest ahead of the exponential adoption – focusing on capital rather than operating expenditure – and hire people who are vastly overqualified and therefore ready for each rapid wave of change.Secondly, hyperscale businesses achieve tremendous operating leverage, largely through process automation. Automation means that you do not have to suffer from diminishing returns to scale. Compare Detroit in 1990 and Silicon Valley in 2014. The three top companies in Detroit produced revenues of $250bn with 1.2m employees and a combined market capitalisation of $36bn. The top three companies in Silicon Valley in 2014 had revenues of $247bn, only 137,000 employees, but a market capitalisation of $1.09tnThirdly, hyperscale businesses exploit digital marginal cost economics. You can scale up hyperscale companies quickly because information goods have almost zero storage, transportation and replication costs. It took Buzzfeed, the online media organisation, only six years to attain 130m unique readers per month. In contrast, the New York Times has a monthly readership of 54m – despite the fact that the newspaper has existed since 1851.Fourth, if you run a hyperscale businesses, you will place yourself at the heart of rich ecologies of players (large and small). Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are embedded in the digital lives of their users and know how to generate value for advertisers and app developers. In turn, online hyperscale businesses provide rich – global – opportunities for many smaller businesses and service providers. On eBay, 97 per cent of commercial sellers export goods to customers in foreign countries, compared with less than 10 per cent in the case of traditional small businesses in most countries.Fifth, every hyperscale business is a big-data business. Online companies with large numbers of users can determine a great deal from their clickstreams and then monetise that information. Payment networks such as Visa, MasterCard, Amex and other players such as Square know a great deal about customers’ spending, and have created business lines based on mining this data. You must learn how to collect, integrate, manage, experiment and derive insight from big data to compete as a hyperscale business.Finally, hyperscale businesses create new business models that can quickly threaten incumbents. The characteristics that made Amazon successful in selling books armed the company for its assault on many other retail categories, its move into ecommerce and virtual-storefront services and eventually Amazon Web Services for cloud computing. As a business leader, you must consider what hyperscale businesses, existing and potentially emerging, could threaten your business model and how, and indeed whether you could grow a hyperscale businesses out of your existing company.Hyperscale businesses are already remoulding daily lives, and reshaping the ecology of business. Now is the time to get to know how to run them, or be ready to compete again them.

142;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;US venture fund Nyca Partners seeks fintech edge;;A new venture capital fund seeks to bridge the divide between Wall Street banks and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs by bringing together seasoned bankers and tech executives to support start-ups aiming to disrupt modern finance.Nyca Partners, founded by Hans Morris, a long-time Citigroup banker and former president of Visa, says it will invest $20m-$25m over the next 18 months in financial technology companies focusing on alternative consumer credit, merchant payment solutions and financial infrastructure software.The fund’s launch comes as a host of start-ups apply technology and digital data to disintermediate big banks and the way they underwrite loans, raise capital and process payments.Mr Morris will be joined by four other partners including Max Levchin, PayPal co-founder and chairman of Yelp, and Brian Finn, a former president at Credit Suisse First Boston and partner at buyout group Clayton, Dubilier and Rice.“There is more innovation in financial services now than ever . . . but none of the venture capitalists are experts in the financial system,” said Mr Morris. “We bring together expertise on the financial system with lots of Silicon Valley connections.”The New York-based fund has made investment in nine companies to date including Lending Club, the prominent peer-to-peer lender where Mr Morris is a board member along with former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers and former Morgan Stanley chief executive John Mack.Lending Club, which has an internet platform that allows borrowers to directly connect with investors, is preparing a long-awaited initial public offering that is expected to value the company at around $5bn, illustrating the potential for such financial technology start-ups.“Credit is going to change in a very material way,” said Mr Morris. “When I started on Wall Street in 1980 my recollection is there were about 100 companies in the world that had access to the bond market. Ten years later 100 per cent of investment-grade companies had access to the bond market. Consumer credit is [going through] the same thing and the explaining variable is the declining information cost.”In addition to Lending Club, Nyca has invested in Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform that competes with Kickstarter, and Affirm, a company founded by Mr Levchin that seeks to create a new way for consumers to apply for short-term credit.Many US banks and credit card companies still rely on decades-old software to underwrite and review borrowers’ creditworthiness, creating what Mr Morris sees as an opportunity for new systems and competitors.The name Nyca is an amalgamation of “New York” and “California” – a nod to the fund’s intermingling of Wall Street veterans and Silicon Valley technology specialists.
143;V;Visa Inc;2014-07-25T16:25:52Z;Visa falls after cut to sales guidance;Company points to Russia effect on cross-border transactions;Visa, which has found itself uncomfortably stuck in the middle of political wranglings between the US and Russia, was forced on Thursday to cut its sales guidance, a move that weighed on the company’s shares as well as those of rival credit card processors.The San Francisco-based company pointed to lower-than-expected cross-border transactions across a number of countries where geopolitical tension remains high, particularly Ukraine and Russia.Bryon Pollitt, the company’s chief financial officer, told analysts that while fourth-quarter revenues would rebound, they would be lower than anticipated earlier because of a drop-off in cross-border transactions and “unusually low levels of volatility across a broad range of currencies”.The company highlighted declining transactions between Russia and Ukraine with Europe, among other countries, for the dimmed view.Visa and MasterCard are also likely be hurt by a drive by the Russian government to establish a national payments system, which follows the suspension of services for customers of Russian banks affected by sanctions earlier this year.The comments on Russia came as the company reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $1.4bn, an increase of 11 per cent over the prior year.James Schneider, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the results were “disappointing” but that overall consumer spending would improve, lifting the company’s prospects.“We view this as a temporary phenomenon which is being driven by the simultaneous impact of lower international travel volumes in specific geographies, given regional unrest,” Mr Schneider said.Shares of Visa fell 3.58 per cent to close at $214.77, while MasterCard slipped 2.35 per cent to $75.75. American Express slid 1.31 per cent to $91.93.Pandora Media, the music streaming service, fell by more than a tenth as the company continued to rack up losses amid intensifying competition.The company, which has promised to spend aggressively on marketing to compete better with Spotify and Apple, said its loss swelled 70 per cent from a year earlier to $11.7m, or 6 cents per share.“Lack of near-term profits leaves shares vulnerable to shortfall in usage metrics, irrespective of Pandora’s clear success driving usage and ad share,” Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said.Pandora, however, said full-year sales would be above earlier estimates while earnings would range from 16 to 19 cents a share, slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Shares in the company, which counts 76.4m active users, slumped 10.34 per cent to end at $25.75.Wall Street wagged its collective finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Friday for spending that sent the world’s largest online retailer into the red last quarter.Shares in the company declined 9.65 per cent to $324.01.Amazon, which disclosed its second-quarter loss after the stock market closed on Thursday, said that some of the 24 per cent increase in spending last quarter came from investment in its cloud computing business, which competes with Microsoft and Oracle to host websites and store companies’ data digitally.Deckers Outdoor, the owner of the Ugg and Teva shoe brands, said its first-quarter loss was narrower than Wall Street estimates on strong consumer demand for its newer product lines as well as higher initial wholesale shipments heading into the fall.Sales rose 24 per cent from a year earlier to $211m in the three months to June 30. The company’s loss widened by a fifth to $36.8m, or $1.07 per share.Analysts with Jefferies lifted their view of the company to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ following the results. Deckers shares jumped 6.18 per cent to $90.50. Peer Skechers rose 0.17 per cent to end at $52.39.Overall, US equity markets slipped as geopolitical tensions continued to linger.

145;V;Visa Inc;2014-07-01T19:22:36Z;Russia boost for Visa and MasterCard;;Russia has raised hopes that Visa and MasterCard can continue operating in the country without paying hefty security deposits required under new legislation taking effect on Tuesday.If the two US credit card companies find ways by October 31 to process card transactions of Russian customers in Russia, the deposits – originally set at 25 per cent of daily turnover – will be reduced to zero, Russian media quoted Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina as saying in St Petersburg on Tuesday.The apparent softening of the new rules underlines Russia’s challenges in trying to reduce its dependence on the infrastructure of international finance as it is being threatened with further sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine.Visa and MasterCard have been caught in the crosshairs as political wrangling between Russia and the US have left them struggling to comply with the demands of operating in both countries.“Throughout this period, our message has been clear – we share the Russian government’s goal of moving more transactions from cash to electronic payments but not at any cost,” Ilya Riaby, general manager for MasterCard’s Russian business, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.After the two companies suspended services for customers of Russian banks affected by sanctions earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin ordered the government to work on the establishment of a national payments system.So far, Visa and MasterCard transmit information on all Russian transactions to their processing centres outside Russia for clearing. Russian banking experts said the two US card companies could either team up with Russian partners for onshore processing or would need to otherwise attain the status of domestic processors.MasterCard’s Mr Riaby said that the company had received responses from 20 Russian companies that could deliver switching and processing of MasterCard’s transactions in Russia and that it will choose a partner in the coming weeks. He also said progress had been made, including a delay to the introduction of the security deposit.“Final rules for payment systems in Russia still have not been adopted,” Visa said in a statement on Tuesday. “Visa has been in close and constant conversations with the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian government regarding the NPS [National Payment System] law.” The company added that it was actively working to localise domestic transactions.A law passed in May on such a payments system made it illegal for the two US card companies to block electronic payments for Russian customers and set the security deposit requirement. Visa has warned it expected the new rules to have an adverse impact on its earnings, and MasterCard said it was likely domestic processing would be required to move onshore.However, the preparations for the national payment system have been dragging on as the Central Bank has yet to decide which software to use and who should manage the new system. On Tuesday, Ms Nabiullina was quoted as saying the deadline for a working group to choose between a technology owned by state-owned Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, and another domestic software system had been extended until mid-July. The government expects that the new platform will not be ready until 18 months from now.
146;V;Visa Inc;2014-06-18T23:22:39Z;Critics decry ugly beautiful game;Little can be kept secret in business. Corruption, criminality, wrongdoing will out;"If only it were just a game.The start of the World Cup in Brazil has been marred by controversy surrounding Qatar’s successful bid to host the 2022 competition.The politics and finances of Fifa, football’s governing body, have long been murky and mysterious, as the FT’s John Gapper explained last week.But now businesses are, uncharacteristically, speaking up publicly to express their concerns over how the Qataris won the right to hold the tournament in their country in eight years’ time.Three big sponsors have made similarly anodyne yet not insignificant statements.Visa (“all of our partners [should] maintain strong ethical standards and operate with transparency”); Sony (bribery accusations should “be investigated appropriately”, Fifa should observe “its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play”); and Adidas (“The negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners”).For once, businesses were taking a lead to say that high standards in public life and officialdom had to be maintained. They did not wait for protesters to push them into it. They drew a line in the Qatari sand for themselves.Maybe in the world of sport, and in relation to specific sporting events, it is easier to be unequivocal.When it comes to other industries – textiles, energy, mining, arms sales – boards might not always be so quick to “just say no”. Indeed, there will be markets where without a more flexible approach and sensitivity to local custom and practice there might be no business to be done at all.We are entering that perilous but unavoidable question of relativism.Companies can draw up codes of conduct in clean, air-conditioned rooms in secure and seemingly incorruptible settings. They can design Q&A flow-charts and provide online assistance for colleagues who need advice in morally tricky situations. But there is theory, and then there is practice. And we live in a de facto world, not a theoretical one.It would be a brave sales director who returned to headquarters to report that, after he’d refused to offer the generous and possibly excessive hospitality that a potential client seemed to expect, the contract had been won by a less puritanical competitor. In fact, that sales director might not remain a sales director for very long.But what the World Cup sponsors’ public doubts confirm is that it is getting harder for businesses to duck ethical controversies of this kind. Many will find this encouraging. Relativism is becoming a less effective and also a less sensible option.Very little can be kept secret for long in business any more. Corruption, criminality and wrongdoing will out. When even countries’ security services do not know if and when vast amounts of their confidential data are about to be published on the internet, the concept of privacy has clearly changed.This degree of scrutiny and exposure may not always be comfortable. But it may free corporate leaders from the prison of relativism. The question they have to ask is: “How will this look when people find out?”Transparency International is not just a good name for a campaigning charity. It also describes the rules of the game for global business in today’s world."

We expect Fifa to take all necessary steps to address the issue.”BP, whose Castrol brand is another second-tier sponsor, also called on Fifa to deal with the allegations in “a right and proper manner”.According to insiders at the sponsors, the statements were co-ordinated.“It is pretty obvious,” said one insider. “The sponsors realise these repeated allegations are not good for anybody, not good for Fifa and not good for the sponsors.” Fifa, was feeling the pressure from sponsors, he added.As Brazil prepares for the start of the World Cup on Thursday, Mr Blatter was shoring up his own position, corralling Fifa members to support his campaign for re-election for a fifth four-term.Responding to allegations in the Sunday Times about the way Qatar won the right to host the 2022 tournament, he told a meeting of Asian football officials in São Paulo: “The way the British press have started this Qatargate, I do not exactly know the rationale behind it. But we have to maintain the unity in Fifa.”Qatar has always maintained it won the bid on merit. But in a nod to Fifa’s critics, Mr Blatter said Michael Garcia, the US attorney examining the allegations, would address Fifa member gathering this week in São Paulo.Sponsors do not provide as much income to Fifa as broadcasters, who make up around 60 per cent of the governing body’s revenues. Fifa estimates it will make $5bn of revenues in 2015-18 – $2.7bn from broadcast deals and $2.3bn from a combination of sponsorship, hospitality and ticketing.When the sponsors said funding was at stake, the problem could not be ignored, says Michael PayneContinue readingThe top six sponsors are each paying €40m-€70m for their four-year deals, according to sponsor insiders. One said they spend double that amount promoting their deals through media campaigns.Sponsors react in different ways to controversies affecting the sports brands they support.Nike, for example, has stuck with Tiger Woods despite the golfer’s sullied reputation. The company only ended its support for Lance Armstrong when the cyclist’s fall from grace was all but complete. But it parted company with Paralympian Oscar Pistorius almost immediately after he was arrested on suspicion of his girlfriend’s murder.Fifa’s tarnished reputation is usually brushed aside by its sponsors. They deflect it by emphasising how they are sponsors of the World Cup rather than the football governing body. One sponsor insider said: “Nobody loves Fifa.”Simon Chadwick, sports business professor at Coventry University, said there was an emerging “market-driven morality” governing whether sponsors stick with tarnished sports brands.But though World Cup sponsors might suffer from reputation damage and even adverse sales through association with Fifa, they face big strategic calls.“These are huge investments to simply walk away from,” he said. Furthermore, withdrawal “potentially cedes control and power to a market rival”.Adidas, a World Cup sponsor since 1970, which is signed up until 2030, began its marketing programme last summer promoting the national teams of Spain, Argentina, Germany and others. It is targeting €2bn in football product sales this year.The German sportswear brand, for whom the World Cup is the biggest test of its battle with rival Nike to dominate the football market, said while it was global partners of Fifa, “what’s important for us is to activate around the world”.

149;V;Visa Inc;2014-06-08T20:21:35Z;Big sponsors pile pressure on Fifa over Qatar World Cup;;Three of the biggest World Cup sponsors have urged Fifa to investigate claims over how Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 football tournament, increasing the pressure on the governing body’s president Sepp Blatter.Sony, Adidas and Visa, who make up half of Fifa’s main sponsors, all released statements over the weekend voicing concerns about Qatar 2022, which is at the centre of allegations about secret payments and trade deals to help the tiny Gulf state win the right to host the tournament.They were responding to a second wave of allegations, based on leaked documents, published by the Sunday Times about the influence of the Gulf state’s former Fifa vice-president, Mohammed bin Hammam, on its bid team.In a strongly worded statement, Adidas said: “The negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners.”Sony, whose World Cup sponsorship runs up to and includes this summer’s tournament in Brazil, said: “As a Fifa partner, we expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately.”Visa said it expected Fifa to take “appropriate actions”, adding: “Our expectation remains that all of our partners maintain strong ethical standards and operate with transparency.”Coca-Cola, another sponsor, said: “Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the Fifa World Cup is a concern to us, but we are confident Fifa is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the investigatory chamber of the Fifa ethics committee.”The comments from the World Cup sponsors, which rarely speak out publicly about Fifa politics, come just days before the start of the 2014 tournament in Brazil.Michael Payne, who was the marketing director of the International Olympic Committee during its Salt Lake City corruption scandal, said Fifa’s Qatar controversy had entered a new phase.“It is clearly reaching a whole new level of concern in that sponsors historically with the World Cup have always been passive or discreet with their observations on Fifa politics,” he said.Armed with what it called a substantial cache of leaked documents, the Sunday Times claimed that Mr bin Hammam helped push a gas deal between his government and Thailand and actively worked for the bid.It also claimed the disgraced Qatari was invited to meet Vladimir Putin, Russian president, in the weeks before successful Russian and Qatari bids to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, which were won at a vote of the Fifa executive committee in December 2010.Mr bin Hammam, who is banned from football for life, also arranged for discreet meetings between members of the Qatari royal family and members of the Fifa executive committee, including Mr Blatter, the newspaper said.Damian Collins, a Conservative member of the UK parliament and campaigner for Fifa reform, said the new material demonstrated the close links between Mr bin Hammam and the bid. “It is incredible that he wasn’t involved in the bid for the World Cup,” he said.Mr Collins urged the other major sponsors – Coca-Cola, Hyundai and Emirates – to speak out. “The only language Fifa understands is money,” he said.“If they feel their commercial interests are being dragged down by this process, that may force them to act.”Emirates, Dubai’s state-owned airline, declined to comment, while Hyundai could not immediately be reached on Sunday.The only language Fifa understands is money. If they feel their commercial interests are being dragged down by this process, that may force them to actFifa’s top six sponsors contribute around $180m a year to Fifa revenues, compared with $600m a year from broadcasters.Mr Blatter, who plans to use the Fifa Congress to announce he is running for a fifth four-year term, said at the weekend he would await the findings of an investigation into the bidding process by Michael Garcia, the US attorney appointed by Fifa as its ethics investigator.Mr Garcia’s investigation ends on Monday and he will spend the next six weeks writing his report.Fifa insiders said he was aware of much of the material published last week by the Sunday Times, which claimed it had documents showing Mr bin Hammam handed out £3m to African football officials to influence the World Cup bidding vote.Mr Garcia has always maintained that he was willing to consider any material presented to him. One insider said this had not changed, despite his timetable for drawing up his report.
150;V;Visa Inc;2014-06-08T17:40:50Z;Facebook takes on Twitter and TV in World Cup marketing battle;;Facebook is hoping the World Cup will win it the upper hand in live events marketing, as it takes on Twitter and even the TV networks by claiming it can reach 500m football fans.The social network is touting its user base as the “biggest stadium in the world” – a global audience for advertisers to target during the football tournament which begins this week.Facebook is gearing up for a fight with Twitter, which has been seen as dominating live events especially after a record-breaking tweet at the Oscars, by stressing its much larger reach and more precise demographic targeting.Will Platt-Higgins, director of global accounts at Facebook, said 2014 will be the first World Cup that will be followed on people’s smartphones.“For the first time in 2014, we, all of us, are carrying around a mobile stadium in our pockets, where you will be watching, learning scores, team sheets, changes, injuries, substitutes – all of it – and sharing it,” he said. “That is a hugely compelling thing for a marketer.”Facebook said it has identified 500m users with an interest in football, based on links they have clicked on or pages they have liked. This is almost double Twitter’s total monthly active userbase of 255m.While Twitter has positioned itself as a companion advertising product to TV, striking revenue share deals with major networks, Facebook thinks it can supplement and maybe even replace TV as a medium to target fans.“This 500m – it is very, very difficult to find reach like it in TV,” Mr Platt-Higgins said, adding it was far easier to adapt a Facebook advertising campaign halfway through a match as the scores come in.Twitter is also trying to teach marketers to develop adverts as matches progress, running a trial where advertising agencies were asked to create promotional content while watching old World Cup footage.With no single social media site proving the definitive home of live events, brands are creating more personalised ads to adapt for use across internet networks.Budweiser is opening a social media studio in São Paulo, where it will help handpicked “influencers” from different countries create videos to post online, while McDonald's will re-enact some of the key moments of the tournament by using French fries instead of footballers.Kevin Burke, chief marketing officer for Visa, an official sponsor of the games, said the payments company now spends an average of 30 per cent of its marketing budget on digital media, more than the global average of 23 per cent, according to E-Marketer.Visa will use Facebook to target football fans’ other interests, and offer them coupons with their partners. “You can tell by looking at the social graph if someone is also interested in music, shopping, fashion . . . which results in better target messaging to you as an individual,” Mr Burke said.YouTube will also feature prominently, with Visa enlisting directors from 32 countries to create videos that show how football is celebrated in their culture.Coke took photos shared by fans on Facebook and Twitter and printed them on a football-pitch-size flag that was designed by a Brazilian street artist and will be unveiled at the opening match this Thursday. The company is also experimenting with the Yahoo-owned blogging site Tumblr, Chinese social networks Weibo and Renren and the Russian site VK.
151;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Isle of Man launches solid gold credit card backed by the metal;;Possessing a gold Visa card is about to take on a whole new meaning with the launch of the world’s first solid gold credit card backed by the precious metal itself.The 14-carat card will be issued to depositors of bullion in a bank vault on the Isle of Man. Those with at least £100,000-worth of bars can borrow against them using the gold Visa card, or, more practically, a plastic version.Ed Pearce, managing director of IMGold, issuer of the Bullion Card, said it would allow those with wealth tied up in the precious metal to access cash without selling the gold, after its value dropped by about a quarter last year.“There are people who invested in 2011 at $1,900 an ounce and now it is worth less than $1,300 an ounce. They are sitting on losses and don’t want to sell. Now they can spend and get some liquidity,” said Mr Pearce.He added that it would also appeal to people who might have “invitation only” cards that are taken off them on ill-defined eligibility criteria, such as American Express’s Centurion card.The interest rate on the card, which will be available later this year, is expected to be below 10 per cent because of the security of the gold.Last year, the gold price fell by 28 per cent – the largest annual decline since 1981 – ending a 12-year bull run. The biggest sellers were western investors in gold-backed exchanged traded funds, though some people also sold physical bullion. The precious metal made a brighter start to 2014, but has fallen back during the past week, and, at $1,246 a troy ounce on Tuesday, is only 3 per cent up for the year.Several attempts to launch gold-backed credit cards have failed to take off to date, according to Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, a London precious metals broker.“Even if transaction costs were minimal, firm advocates of the gold standard would rather hold metal and spend currency than the other way round,” said Mr Ash. “Mobilising existing gold holdings may appeal to investors needing cash, but only if costs are below pawnbroking fees.”IMGold was set up last year after a number of banks on the offshore centre closed their vaults and safety deposit boxes amid tightening regulations. The Isle of Man has no inheritance or capital gains tax, and any heist would be difficult as it would require moving the metal by boat or plane.“A lot of people like the physical nature of gold. They know it is there and they can visit,” said Mr Pearce.He believes the chance to borrow against it would attract more customers.Several banks have issued solid gold cards, but none is backed by the metal itself. Rosan Diamond, the Russian company that produces several gold cards, has been commissioned by IMGold.The Visa Infinite card backed by Catella Bank of Luxembourg, which provides private bank cards, will be available this year. It carries the usual benefits such as insurance on worldwide travel, concierge services, purchase protection, luxury hotels booking, airport lounge access and discounts at high-end shopping outlets.Sberbank in Kazakhstan launched the first yellow metal credit card in 2012, which is also encrusted with 26 diamonds and an inlay of mother of pearl. A year later ATF Bank in the same country followed suit.Riyad Bank in Saudi Arabia recently launched the first World Elite MasterCard, which is gold plated and invitation only.Those in Qatar with $1bn in assets and $1m in the Qatar First Bank can have a precious metal charge card. At Qatar National Bank there is a diamond-studded card available, also by invitation only.“Cards are often more than just debit or credit cards – they’re status symbols. As cards have developed, so have the designs, the materials and the cost. For some it’s not about the colour of your card, but what your card is made out of,” said Visa.There remains one card more exclusive than any other, however. Azerbaijan’s Zaminbank created a single pure gold card that is encrusted with gemstones in a unique design. Its holder is Nadir Amir Ismayilov, the bank’s chairman and main shareholder.
152;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Mobile payments groups set sights on winning over UK wallets;;"With banks, telecom operators and technology groups all scrambling to sign up Britain’s tap-happy mobile payers and shoppers, consumers are faced with a bewildering array of mobile payment options.The latest is from Klarna, the Swedish start-up whose service will launch with several British retailers this summer. Its selling point is its use of complex algorithms to check each transaction for fraud, based on factors like a customer’s purchase history and the time of day they buy something.“The UK is a mobile play,” the company said, adding that the country’s shoppers present an attractive opportunity because while Britain is Europe’s biggest ecommerce market, it lags behind in the percentage of users finalising purchases on mobile.The expanding number of mobile payment options reflects, in part, the growing popularity of the service.The value of goods and services purchased using a mobile phone is expected to almost triple from £4.8bn in 2013 to £14.2bn in 2018, according to a report by the Centre for Economic and Business Research. It believes that more than 20m adults will be using mobile payments by the end of the decade.It is also supported by a continually expanding network of infrastructure. London’s transport authority, for example, is negotiating a deal with telecoms groups to let users swipe on and off the Underground with phones with “near field communications” chips.Hard currency remains popular for small transactions, according to research on Monday, but there are other, heavily psychological, reasons for its resilience
See belowBut for many shoppers, using mobile payments is only marginally more convenient than traditional options. The credit card is also being transformed by new technology – contactless credit card payments topped £100m in a month in the UK for the first time in April, according to the UK Cards Association.This has led analysts and observers to say that the key to changing consumer behaviour is to expand mobile payments to include other, more valuable services.“It’s not just about being able to pay – it’s about being able to have your coupons, discounts, vouchers, rewards all in one place,” says Sandy Shen of research group Gartner. “This is the value proposition of the mobile wallet over the cash or credit card.”There is certainly no lack of enthusiastic parties trying to make that a reality. Here is a look at some of the players in mobile payments in the UK.The banksPaym is the big move by the banks into mobile payments. It allows people to transfer money to retailers or friends by typing in a phone number from within their mobile banking app. Since its launch last month, 500,000 phone numbers have been registered. More than 90 per cent of UK current account holders will be able to use to use Paym by the end of the year.However, it is not the first. Barclays’ Pingit app, which also used phone numbers for money transfer, was its precursor. Pingit is a standalone app that started out exclusively for Barclays customers but later expanded to all UK current accounts. Pingit has been downloaded by 2.8m people, who have made £475m worth of transfers on the platform since its launch in 2012.Almost all banks have their own apps, but beyond Paym most of them only allow customers to manage their accounts and make bill payments to preset recipients.The mobile operatorsEE allows contactless payments via smartphone for purchases under £20. Money needs to be “preloaded” on to a digital wallet and account details stored on a secure part of the phone’s SIM card.Vodafone is expected to launch a similar wallet service in the UK this summer, while rivals offer ticketing and online payment functions.However, the three largest mobile phone groups have also pooled resources in a venture called Weve, which began as a targeted advertising venture but has plans to expand into payments next year. Weve has access to details of about 22m customers of the three groups.Weve has already launched an app, called Pouch, which offers a sophisticated loyalty scheme for participating retailers.The payment providersPayPal is the best known provider of digital wallets, with card companies such as MasterCard and Visa instead choosing to work with other providers.The PayPal app, which needs to be preloaded with money, lets you pay from wherever you happen to be in a shop or restaurant that accepts the payment method, as well as transfer money to friends and order ahead.The technology groupsSome of the options available to shoppers overseas have not yet made it to the UK, but Google’s Wallet service – which allows people to put cash on their phone to spend online – has been rumoured to be arriving for some time. Other large US groups such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook are also said to be considering providing some form of financial services.Zapp, a smartphone app, will let UK bank customers pay for goods and services when it launches this autumn. Vocalink, owned by a group of banks that run the UK’s payments infrastructure and which has developed the app, wants it to work in-store, but initially it will only be available to make online purchases.Cash still king for small transactionsBritain might be a nation of shopkeepers, as Napoleon quipped, but how much longer will it be a country of cash handlers?The value of cash payments fell 14 per cent over the past five years as a proportion of all UK retail sales, according to research published by the British Retail Consortium.Cash accounted for less than a third of the value of retail sales in 2013, while the average size of cash transactions declined 3 per cent from the year before, to £9.78.Contactless cards and mobile payments are eating into the popularity of hard currency. But cash remains popular for small transactions and is still the cheapest way for shops to take money from customers. It accounted for just over half of all retail transactions in 2013, but made up 9 per cent of total transaction costs.“Customers are taking advantage of new ways to shop and pay,” said Helen Dickinson, the director-general of the BRC. “This is very much in line with the attention customers have paid to price and value during the recent economic uncertainty as they have sought to minimise payments from their budgets for everyday items.”The survey looked at £191bn worth of retail sales in store and online, accounting for 60 per cent of the UK total.The persistence of hard currency may have less to do with value for money than with its symbolic importance. Take how enthusiastically those pushing for greater female representation received last year’s news that the Bank of England would put novelist Jane Austen, pictured right, on its £10 note.David Graeber, the radical economic anthropologist, has argued that money did not emerge simply to make exchanging goods and services easier – rather, it came about as a way to facilitate certain kinds of moral and social relationships. “[T]he real origins of money,” he writes, “are to be found in crime and recompense, war and slavery, honour, debt and redemption.”"
153;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Mobile payments revolution is still to take off;Apps or persuasion have so far failed to convince customers to pay in-store;Tech companies might have invested millions in persuading people to make payments with their mobile phones, but the closure of a high-profile app launched by Twitter’s co-founder suggests too few are willing to listen.Mobile payments start-up Square – launched by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and valued in January at $5bn – this week abandoned its three-year-old Square Wallet app. It had aimed to revolutionise payments by allowing users to activate the app when entering a store and then pay by giving their name to the cashier, who simply confirmed their identity by checking a photo online.However, the problem, according to analysts, is that consumers prefer to use the credit cards that have served them so well for decades. Mobile wallet apps that let consumers pay via smartphones are “a solution in search of a problem”, says Kebbie Sebastian, who runs payments advisory firm Penser Consulting.Alongside Square, corporate groups including Google, Visa, PayPal, AT&T have all tried to devise a popular mobile payment system – which would enable them either to profit from commissions on transactions, or to glean valuable customer data.But all have struggled to convince consumers to start paying in stores with an app or a tap of their phone on a specially-enabled cash register.As a result, many new start-ups seeking to change the way people pay for goods are turning back to the plastic rectangles first devised in the 1950s: credit cards.“People view …their phone as a content and media and communications tool,” says Jeff Mullen, founder of card start-up Dynamics. Essential personal items, such as wallets and house keys, “are things you want to keep separate”, he argues.Some technology start-ups are developing ways to make the use of credit cards more secure following large-scale theft of credit card data from retailers including Target and Neiman Marcus. One of the cards made by Dynamics, a company backed by Bain Capital, uses embedded electronics to re-encrypt data after each use, making the cards harder to copy.Other start-ups are trying to using smartphones not as a way to pay directly, but as a way to give consumers greater control over use of their card.Start-up OnDot is developing an app that links with cards – making it harder for a thief to use a stolen card. The app lets cardholders put limits on where and when their card may be used – which would also enable companies to prevent corporate cards being used in Las Vegas, for example.Coin, which raised more than $15m last year, makes a credit-card shaped device that stores data from multiple cards, cutting down the number of cards someone needs to carry. Like OnDot, it also has an app that can alert users, and deactivate a card, if the card is too far from the phone.OnDot’s founder, Vaduvur Bharghavan, suggests the banks that issue cards have more incentive to promote systems like these to their customers than they did for mobile wallets. He argues that the app reduces fraud and helps the companies distinguish their cards from competitors, meaning the card gets used more frequently – earning more fees for the issuing banks.“From a consumer perspective, [mobile wallets] are convenient, but banks don’t like it because they become commoditised,” says Mr Bharghavan. He suggests users of Square Wallet or PayPal are likely not to care so much about the bank they use.Other card-based technologies being launched include one that links up with Bitcoin to enable people to pay with the cryptocurrency anywhere that normal cards are accepted.Even so-called disruptive tech companies still rely on the popularity of plastic cards when designing payments systems. Airbnb, for example, which has shaken up the home rental market with its online platform, issues rechargeable cards to people who rent out their homes but who do not want to receive payments via a bank transfers.“There’s just so much infrastructure that is already deployed,” says Nate Blecharczyk, Airbnb’s co-founder and chief technical officer, of card payment systems. “To upgrade that stuff will take a long time.”

(Quite possibly, no) | By Andrew Collier, Orient Capital Research What happens if China goes broke? China’s Rmb4tn stimulus package in 2008 – and its ballooning lending – has raised fears of a financial collapse. Certainly, debt has exploded. The China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) estimates that total government debt is now Rmb 27tn, or 53%, of GDP. Throw in corporate and household debt, and CASS estimates the total at Rmb 111.6tn ($18.3tn) at the end of 2012, or 215 per cent GDP. Chinese economists are quick to point out that the country has plenty of money to pay off its debts and could easily avert a financial collapse. The government, they say, could function as lender of last resort.- By some measures, China is far from a behemoth | This news that China is poised to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in purchasing power parity terms has prompted plenty of discussion. But, as Jamil Anderlini, the FT’s Beijing bureau chief, points out, size isn’t everything. So here is yet another way of looking at China’s place in the global economy and another excuse to mull how we measure these things. In a new report, the big brains at the McKinsey Global Institute, the consulting house’s own think-tank, try to capture the ways in which globalisation and particularly “flows” of capital, goods, services, people, and data are exploding and finding new forms. They argue that the world today is as much about the flow of data and services as the traditional trade in goods. And they point out that, increasingly, trade is really about “knowledge-intensive” goods and service. In 2012 the trade in knowledge-intensive goods and services – think computer chips, smart phones etc – accounted for $12.6tn of the total $26tn in global “flows”.- India elections: would Pakistan vote for Modi? | It is a national holiday in India on Thursday, meaning there is less news than usual.

155;V;Visa Inc;2014-05-01T19:31:58Z;Visa and MasterCard fear sanctions fallout;;"Visa and MasterCard, the two big US credit card companies, have found themselves in the line of fire between the US and Russia over Ukraine.Both companies warned on their earnings calls in the past week about the impact of proposed legislation in Russia – a response to US sanctions – that will increase the control of the Russian authorities over its payment systems.“I can see it will make it a more complicated situation for anybody that has a payment network in Russia,” MasterCard chief financial officer Martina Hund-Majean told the Financial Times on Thursday, as the company reported better than expected earnings.The Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, is working on draft legislation which is expected to require any payments services provider working in Russia to put its processing centre in the country, and people involved in the discussions said this would offer Moscow the chance to expropriate foreign service providers in the case of a risk such as sanctions.In addition, the Central Bank plans to set up a company to operate a national payments system resembling Germany’s Geldkarte or France’s Carte Bleue.The planned national payments system is not expected to be able to handle global payments but people involved in the discussions said working with China Union Pay, Beijing’s rapidly-expanding payments platform, might be an option for Russian banks to reduce their dependency on Visa and MasterCard.After the US Treasury put businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg on its sanctions list on 21 March, Visa and MasterCard temporarily suspended services for customers of SMP Bank, which the tycoon brothers jointly control.Following that, Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the government to start working on a national payments system.With Washington’s addition of SMP Bank and two other oligarch-controlled institutions to the sanctions list this week, those lenders announced that they were also cutting ties with Visa and MasterCard.The government has said that Moscow does not intend to “punish” the two American payments services providers or lock them out of the market, but Mr Putin said that by keeping their processing centres outside Russia and suspending services following the sanctions, they had “undermined their credibility”, and they would lose market share as a result.“It’s very complex but we’re a global company,” said Ms Hund-Majean. “Every time at this time of the year we work on a number of projects with companies around the world, those projects that we have going on in Russia have not stopped.”Russia represents around $167m in revenue for MasterCard, around 2 per cent of the company’s global annual revenues of $8.3bn.But the concerns are not unique to MasterCard. Visa chief executive Charles Scharf told an analyst call on April 24: “Keep in mind this is all still fluid. And while none of this is certainly helpful for Visa if passed, parts might even cause us to rethink our domestic processing opportunity in Russia. But we’re hopeful that there are still opportunities for Visa to participate in the growing electronic payments business in Russia.”Mr Scharf also provided some detail on the new proposals. While it’s not yet finalised, he said the law may demand all domestic data processing to move onshore and for most domestic transaction data to be domiciled in Russia.He said it would also require a payment network that demands continuity of service in compliance with Russian law and the creation of a settlement centre 100 per cent owned by the central bank of Russia. In addition, he said the proposed new law would demand a collateral requirement for foreign payment systems; and lastly, give Russia the ability to impose fines on foreign payment system providers.Byron Pollitt, Visa’s chief financial officer, said issues with Russia and Ukraine were already affecting cross-border volume and sanctions would impact on payment volumes. He said the company expects several pennies of earnings per share impact for the fiscal year.“We are fully engaged with all parties involved and will continue to adjust our outlook as the situation clarifies over time,” he said."
156;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Moscow relief at level of US action;;When the US announced its latest wave of sanctions against Russia on Monday, there was an almost audible sigh of relief in Moscow.While the seven individuals targeted are among the country’s most powerful and most trusted and relied upon by president Vladimir Putin, the list appears unlikely to have much, if any, new direct economic impact.“There is no attempt to go at the wider economy yet,” said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. “While they are tightening the sanctions, the pace at which they are doing that is glacial.”Although the new sanctions are aimed at a broader list of companies – adding 17 new names – all those groups are tied to Gennady Timchenko, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg or Bank Rossiya, individuals or institutions whose names appeared in the second wave of sanctions in March.The impact of the March action was very narrow because it focused on individuals’ personal assets and on companies in which they held a stake of at least 50 per cent kept. Monday’s sanctions are unlikely to change much because the companies targeted do most of their business inside Russia.The three lenders added to the list are all relatively small players unlikely to have business ties to US or European institutions, bankers said, with the exception of Visa and MasterCard, which provide credit cards for clients at SMP Bank, one of the three.“I would be very surprised if a Bank of America or Nomura woke up this morning with exposure to a client on the sanctions list. Everyone has been very aware of rising Russia risk over the past month,” said David Nangle, head of equity research capital at Renaissance Capital. He noted that most major western banks would already be likely to have cut or reduced their exposure to financial institutions associated with potentially sanctioned individuals.SMP Bank, controlled by the Rotenberg brothers, is the largest of the three lenders targeted, but only the 35th biggest bank in Russia with $5.8bn in assets and $2.8bn worth of deposits, according to Interfax Group.Sobinbank, controlled by Bank Rossiya, is a top-100 lender with $1.5bn in assets and over $700m in deposits. Investcaptial, also owned by the Rotenbergs, ranks only in the top 200 banks, with under $500m in assets and just $300m in deposits.I would be very surprised if a Bank of America or Nomura woke up this morning with exposure to a client on the sanctions list. Everyone has been very aware of rising Russia risk over the past month.On Monday, SMP urged its clients to use “cash or credit cards from different banks” when travelling abroad, and to use other banks for completing any money transfer or currency exchange, as their transactions could be blocked.Visa and MasterCard have said the sanctions have hurt their business in Russia. Both companies have already stopped processing payments by Bank Rossiya, and risk losing further market share to a new Russian national payments system, which is in the process of development.One sector more likely to hurt is Russia’s defence industry, as Washington said it would cancel export licences for technology that could help enhance Russia’s defence capabilities.The country’s weapons industry might already face difficulties as many companies’ supply chains include factories in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has said it wants to continue this co-operation, but defence experts said they had little hope this would work. Mr Putin said Monday it would take two and a half years for Russia to substitute components sourced from Ukraine, and added he saw Western sanctions targeting Russia’s defence sector as an attempt to block such import substitution.Although limited, the earlier rounds of sanctions clearly damaged economic sentiment as investor fears speeded up capital flight and foreign lenders grew more cautious, driving up borrowing costs.In the latest such fallout, Standard & Poor’s cut the credit rating of state oil company Rosneft and state gas giant Gazprom to one notch above junk rating on Monday, following an earlier downgrade of Russia’s sovereign rating.Analysts said the latest list was unlikely to add much to such negative sentiment. “By now, the expectation of indirect negative impact is priced in to some extent,” said Mr Shearing. Russian stocks rallied on Monday.Russia’s President Vladimir Putin moved swiftly to annex Crimea, in the first land grab in Europe since the second world war, and the EU and US are worried over Moscow’s intentions elsewhere in UkraineThe Russian government put on a brave face too. “I think we can still quite calmly look towards 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent growth this year,” Andrei Belousov, Mr Putin’s economic adviser, told Russian media. The finance ministry said earlier this month that the economy was expected to enter recession this quarter.Bankers and investors said the expanded sanctions were unlikely to influence the Kremlin’s stance and strategy in Ukraine. “It’s not really going to affect Putin,” a senior western banker in Moscow said.The only concern in Moscow is that Washington’s next step could hurt more.US officials stopped short of saying directly that the new sanctions on Rosneft chief Igor Sechin and Sergei Chemezov, head of the Rostec state holding which controls vital stakes in defence and technology firms, were preludes to broader action against the companies that they control.However they pointed out that most of the entities placed on the sanctions list on Monday were controlled by individuals who were targeted in previous rounds of sanctions.“Everybody knows who Sechin and Chemezov are and the role they play in both the Russian economy and, frankly, in the leadership circle,” said a senior administration official. “We are going to keep working, together with your allies, to increase the cost on Russia.”
157;V;Visa Inc;2014-04-27T14:28:21Z;Russia payments: Putin’s plastic;Plan for a self-contained Russian payments system an attack on globalisation;Globalisation: it’s a funny old world. In Harrods in London, among the Ladurée macaroons and Fabergé Treillage collection, sit more than 70 UnionPay card terminals.Chinese visitors who flash their plastic use them to pay from home accounts. They have little choice. Within China, government-controlled UnionPay dominates clearing of electronic renminbi payments (including fees on card transactions). This is globalisation with Chinese characteristics.Vladimir Putin can dream. The Russian president plans a similar national payment cards system for Russia, in response to sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. It will be difficult for the Kremlin to build. But its aim – financial autarky – should worry westerners holding Russian assets. These are cheap. The Micex share index is priced less than 5 times its forward earnings. But they may get even cheaper if Russia embraces isolationism.Consider: Visa and MasterCard account for about 95 per cent of Russia’s card market. Given four-fifths of transactions with Russian cards are just to withdraw cash, Russia might seem like a greenfield market for both. And the investment case for both companies shares is built on a secular worldwide trend of electronics replacing cash – that is, faith that globalisation keeps going.But the refinement of financial sanctions policy also keeps going. And while only one Russian bank has been sanctioned to date, Visa and MasterCard quickly froze card services. That made Mr Putin mad. A former secret policeman sees plots everywhere. State-run payments infrastructure built from scratch as an insurance policy is likely to be highly inefficient as a business. But it would be a lasting shift, surviving long after sanctions end.Payments are a path-dependent, network-effect business after all. And globalisation’s forward march is not guaranteed.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
158;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;India’s balance of payments boost: Not so rosy;;"Recent optimism in financial markets about India’s prospects isn’t all driven by pre-election elation. Investors have been cheered by headline improvements to economic fundamentals and at the heart of that positive sentiment is the balance of payments.It’s something the incumbent government is keen to flaunt. But take a closer look and India’s external balances don’t look quite as good as the headline figures suggests.Let’s start at the top, where there are signs of dramatic improvement. India’s current account deficit (CAD) shrank to Rs262bn ($4.35bn), or 0.9 per cent of GDP, in the last quarter of 2013, from Rs1,725bn, or 6.5 per cent of GDP in the same period a year earlier. Thus, one of the biggest worries about the economy appears to have been all but wiped out.This from analysts at Espirito Santo Securities:The Indian economy has strong feedback loops. A stable and well-funded CAD can offset $ strength and provide stability to the rupee. Visible rupee stability will encourage foreign investment and reduce imported inflation. Stability in the economy will allow companies and financial institutions to repair their balance sheets, a necessary precursor to a revival of investment…But the improvements in the current account could well turn out to be artificial and temporary. More than half the reduction in the CAD came from a much smaller trade deficit in “non-monetary gold” – the stuff traded by jewellers and others – where imports shrank to Rs195bn in the last quarter of 2013 from Rs963bn a year earlier (there were no exports in either year), after the government imposed higher duties and other import restrictions.But these policies could soon be rolled back. New Delhi has said it may relax controls on gold imports if India’s external balances improved sufficiently. There has been no official indication as to what level New Delhi may regard as “sufficient” but the improvement in external balances is clear.Merchandise trade, too, played its part in cutting the CAD. Export earnings rose from Rs3,900bn to Rs4,915bn between the last quarter of 2012 and the last quarter of 2013. That is partly driven by a sharp depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar last year, making Indian exports much more competitive.But that effect is also unlikely to last. The return of foreign inflows has driven the rupee back to around 60 to the US dollar, from lows of almost 69 to the dollar last year. And that means India’s exports are no longer so inexpensive to foreign buyers. They are vulnerable to other factors as well.“It did have a lot to do with the rupee depreciation, but also I guess it’s dependent on growth in our trading partners,” says A Prasanna, an economist at ICICI Securities. “We saw some weakness in the first quarter this year… which coincided with the weakness in US data because of weather related issues.”Meanwhile, merchandise imports have remained subdued, up marginally from Rs6,155bn in the final quarter of 2012 to Rs6,814bn in the final quarter of 2013. Economists see that as a phyrrhic victory for New Delhi – sluggish import growth helps with the external balances but is really just a reflection of continued weakness in domestic demand. Imports of capital goods, for example, fell by more than 15 per cent, suggesting sharp falls in both investment and business confidence.“India has suffered a slowdown and quite a drastic slowdown in the last two years,” says Prasanna. “Our expectation is cautious optimism and perhaps faster growth is expected for next year, so import growth would also pick up around that time.”With the current account deficit narrowing there is less pressure on India’s capital account. The Reserve Bank of India was able to add Rs1,185bn ($19.1bn) to its foreign exchange reserves in the final three months of 2013. (The figure a year earlier was Rs42bn.)But the capital account also received a Rs1,331bn ($21.5bn) boost from non-resident Indians bringing money into the country using a temporary mechanism the central bank opened in September last year. These so-called FCNR(B) deposits brought in a total of $34bn while the window was open between September 10 and November 30 – a welcome bailout from overseas Indians at a time of economic turmoil. It’s always possible that the RBI could repeat the exercise, but no such move is planned and it’s not clear that it would be equally effective a second time around.With so many temporary measures and one-offs coming to India’s aid, how vulnerable is it to another downswing? Optimists say renewed growth in the US and Europe will prop up exports, weak demand in India will keep non-oil imports down for a while yet, and any new government will be careful in unleashing gold imports. But that could be optimistic in the extreme.“It’s very difficult to replicate the quarter’s performance for any other quarter unless we get a huge positive surprise – let’s say something from the elections,” says Anubhuti Sahay, an economist at Standard Chartered.Related reading:

159;V;Visa Inc;2014-03-24T20:50:55Z;Monitise to raise £100m as part of overhaul;;Monitise, one of UK’s highest profile tech groups, is to raise about £100m as part of an overhaul of its business model aimed at increasing its revenues in the evolving mobile payments industry.MasterCard has pledged to take part in a fully underwritten placing of about 160m Monitise shares – joining rival Visa among the investors in the secure mobile payments provider.The company will shift from a licence business model, which required its customers to pay a large upfront fee, to a subscription-based model that will reduce costs, as it seeks to expand its customer base.Monitise said that its target was to increase its registered users from 28m to 200m by June 2018, by making it easier to connect to the network.However, the group also warned that revenue growth would be reduced to 40 per cent in 2014 – from previous guidance of 50 per cent – which, combined with a rise in operating expenses, would mean a higher loss of earnings in the second half of the year. The company has recorded pre-tax losses of more than £100m since listing in 2007.Revenue growth next year would also be at a lower rate than 2014, Monitise added, with a move to profitability in terms of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, achieved by 2016. Analysts had expected this to be achieved a year earlier. Revenue growth would also then “accelerate strongly”, the company said.MasterCard will also become a partner in Monitise’s global payments business, joining more than 350 banks and mobile operators. Barclays and Canaccord Genuity are acting as joint bookrunners to the placing.
160;V;Visa Inc;2014-03-23T19:26:42Z;Visa and MasterCard restart payments for Russian banks;;Visa and MasterCard have restarted processing payment transactions for customers of a Russian bank linked to oligarchs blacklisted by the US government on Thursday, in an indication that Washington’s latest sanctions could hit the corporate sector less than initially feared.SMP Bank said on Sunday that the two credit card companies had resumed payments services after cutting them on Friday.Visa said in a statement: “Based on clarifications provided to Visa by the US government, Visa has determined that we are not required to block SMP Bank’s access to our network. As a result, Visa has reestablished network connectivity with SMP.”SMP is jointly owned by Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, billionaire brothers with close links to Vladimir Putin, Russian president. Washington banned them alongside 18 other officials and tycoons from entry to the US and financial transactions with US persons in retaliation for Mr Putin’s annexation of Crimea, which Western leaders have criticised as the biggest threat to peace in Europe since the Cold War.Some of the men on the sanctions list own a web of businesses including large companies that play an important role in the global economy.Gennady Timchenko, another oligarch on the list, said after Thursday’s sanctions announcement that he had sold his entire stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, to shield the company from sanctions against himself. The share price of Novatek, Mr Timchenko’s listed oil and gas firm, fell 12 per cent on Friday.Western financial institutions were scrambling on Thursday and Friday to scan their loan and investment portfolios for exposure to businesses linked to sanctions targets. US lawyers said they had been inundated with calls from US companies trying to confirm whether they would have to cut links with Russian suppliers, especially companies owned by Mr Timchenko and the Rotenberg brothers.In a fact sheet published with the first US sanctions list against Russian officials on March 17, the White House said: “Our current focus is to identify these individuals and target their personal assets, but not companies that they may manage on behalf of the Russian state.”Therefore legal experts have so far expected state companies to be protected from the sanctions. This would apply to the state-owned Russian Railways, whose chief executive, Vladimir Yakunin, is also on the sanctions list.But for privately-owned companies, the situation is less clear. Washington-based sanctions lawyers said that such bans of individuals would normally also reach businesses they own or control.The reversal of Visa’s and MasterCard’s moves against the three banks could mean that Washington’s sanctions move will ripple much less far through corporate Russia than initially feared.“We are glad that the two biggest international payment systems have heard our arguments and reversed their decision,” said Dmitry Kalantyrsky, chief executive of SMP Bank.Reuters reported that Visa said it had also resumed services for clients of Investitsionny Soyuz and InvestKapitalBank after having been assured by the US government that the sanctions targeted individuals, not the companies they owned.Investitsionny Soyuz and InvestKapitalBank declined to comment.Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues in New York
161;V;Visa Inc;2014-03-21T17:53:06Z;Russian executives quake as US sanctions rattle markets;;"As recently as the start of the week, some of Moscow’s financial elite were blasé about the prospect of sanctions. But Russia’s businessmen were no longer smiling by Friday, after expanded US sanctions rippled through financial markets hitting the business interests of some of the country’s richest people.“I do hope that there is some serious diplomatic activity going on behind the scenes,” said one usually unflappable banker at a Russian state bank.The most visible effect of Thursday’s sanctions was on Bank Rossiya, described by the US Treasury as “the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation” – and the country’s 17th largest by assets.Visa and Mastercard suspended payment processing of accounts at the bank and its affiliates, a move which affected “several hundred thousand” bank cards, according to an official at the central bank and led to lines at Bank Rossiya branches as people queued to withdraw their savings. The central bank responded by promising to take any necessary action to support the bank, and President Vladimir Putin also threw his weight behind it.But an equally frenzied response to the sanctions announcement was taking place behind the scenes, as the financial community struggled to work out whether it would still be allowed to deal with some of Russia’s largest companies.Although the only company sanctioned by the US was Bank Rossiya, individuals on the list have connections to companies as large and diverse as Novatek, Russia’s largest independent gas producer – part-owned by Gennady Timchenko; Russian Railways, the country’s rail monopoly – of which Vladimir Yakunin is chairman; and Mostotrest, a major road construction group part owned by Arkady Rotenburg.Washington-based sanctions lawyers said they had been inundated with calls from clients over the past day seeking clarification on whether they needed to cut business links with their Russian suppliers or customers.Lawyers and executives said companies in which the sanctioned individuals held stakes under 50 per cent would not fall under the US sanction order – unless the individuals could be deemed to control the company. That meant only a few, relatively small holdings of the oligarchs would be directly sanctioned.Nonetheless, investors and financiers on Friday recoiled from companies linked to the individuals named in the sanction order as they tried to ascertain the risks of doing business with them. Novatek shares tumbled as much as 13 per cent, while Mostotrest fell as much as 5.7 per cent.One senior western banker in Moscow said that while banks may still be able to work with the individuals’ affiliated businesses from a legal perspective, they would be wary about the reputational risk. “The US banks are a phone call away from the White House and the Senate,” he said.While the direct impact of the sanctions was limited to Bank Rossiya and companies with links to sanctioned individuals, executives and investors warned that confidence in the Russian economy had also suffered a deep blow.Roman Lokhov, chief executive of global markets and investment banking at BCS, the largest independent broker on the Moscow Stock Exchange, said he was concerned the “unofficial sanctions” of behind-the-scenes pressure from regulators could have a much more dramatic effect if US banks felt unable to continue trading with their Russian counterparts.“We are hedged and not touching any Russian instruments right now, only doing client business,” he said.Fitch and Standard & Poor’s both put Russia’s sovereign credit ratings on “negative watch”, with Fitch warning that “US and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances”.Indeed, executives pointed to the rising cost of borrowing as the main drag on the economy. Russia’s government bond yields have risen from 8.44 per cent at the start of the month to a peak of more than 9.6 per cent on Friday.The chief executive of a foreign-owned service sector company in Russia said his firm was in the process of transferring all financing from foreign currency to rouble credit lines. “The main fallout has so far been that the borrowing costs have gone up,” he said. “Our revenues are in roubles, and with the sharp rouble depreciation we can’t keep borrowing in dollars. But rouble lending rates have risen by 1.2 percentage points over the past three weeks, so it’s pretty bad.”"
162;V;Visa Inc;2014-03-19T15:50:38Z;MasterCard and Visa’s priceless business model;Valuations are frothy, but it is a well-protected oligopoly, writes John Authers;"Some things in life are priceless. It would appear that they include MasterCard as well as Visa, and several other companies involved in processing transactions.Both MasterCard and Visa started out as collaborations by bank consortiums. Since floating in 2006, MasterCard has gained more than 440 per cent. The larger Visa, which floated in 2008, has gained 180 per cent. Both flatten the broader market.Valuations are now in nosebleed territory. Using price-to-book multiples, the most popular measure for financials, Visa trades at more than six times book, while MasterCard is at some 12.5 times. Both have doubled their book multiples in the past three years. Large banks are typically selling at or near their book value.It is possible to put this down to the one-off gains when a well-protected business becomes a for-profit quoted company. Initially, there are huge gains as profits are squeezed out. This is what happened when stock and derivatives exchanges went public in a wave of flotations about a decade ago. But those gains were not sustained – the Dow Jones Global Exchange index has gained some 9 per cent since the end of 2009, while Visa and MasterCard have doubled.And it is not just MasterCard and Visa. Discover Financial Services, which offers the Discover card – a far smaller competitor – has vastly outperformed the big two, with its stock expanding eightfold over the past five years. PayPal remains one of the great Silicon Valley venture capital success stories of recent years. Estimates of the valuation that mobile payment company Square could receive whenever it floats continue to multiply. And of course Bitcoin, under several layers of hype and hysteria, is another very interesting transactions processing play.This looks dangerously frothy. Nevertheless, most bubbles start with at least some plausible case. Can the current share prices of Visa and MasterCard really be justified, or is the online payments industry moving into a bubble?One argument comes from growth. Projections for expansion border on the stratospheric. This growth should come from two sources: first, from growth in consumption expenditure, primarily from the developing world; and second, from encroachment on the territory of cash and cheques, neither of which can be used to complete an online transaction.Globally, according to figures tracked by Bloomberg Industries, payment volume rose 9 per cent last year, with PayPal gaining 24 per cent and MasterCard 13 per cent. For the future, Visa points out that cash and cheques made up 41 per cent of 2012 expenditure in developed markets and 62 per cent in emerging markets. This creates what it calls an $11tn opportunity.Meanwhile, it forecasts 4 per cent annual expenditure growth from now to 2016 in developed markets – 10 per cent in the emerging world.The problem with such projections is a familiar one. Growth could indeed be very impressive, but that makes it harder to calculate a present value for future earnings. History tells us that markets tend to overestimate and overextrapolate future earnings in an environment such as this. This happened most spectacularly during the dotcom bubble. Yes, there are good reasons to project growth, but that does not necessarily justify paying 12 times book for MasterCard.A second reason hinges on Warren Buffett’s principle of the “wide economic moat”. If a franchise is well protected, value investors can pay more than they would normally like. In the case of Visa and MasterCard, it would be prohibitively expensive to set up a rival with the same business model. This is as well-protected an oligopoly as it is possible to imagine. Various aspects of this model have been examined, and even punished, by antitrust authorities over the years: they still make lots of money.The case goes further. Hutch Vernon, who runs a “flexible equity” mutual fund for Brown Advisory in Baltimore, suggests that Visa and MasterCard can maintain their status as tollbooths for online commerce (even PayPal, arguably a rival, channels money through their systems) without needing to make reinvestments.Their networks are already built. The exchanges needed to invest in technology to fend off new competitors who still managed to chip away at their trading volume. For Visa and MasterCard, capital can safely go towards reducing shares outstanding, while growth continues.Does this make the case to buy at these valuations? Perhaps not. The low dividend yields the companies pay (neither pays as much as 1 per cent) leave little income to help out if investors do become risk-averse again. And investors have to pay up for the undoubted quality of their earnings.Those hoping to profit if the online payments area turns into a bubble, which it may have done already, might want to look hard for anyone with a business model that could encroach on the card networks’ revenues."
163;V;Visa Inc;2014-03-12T18:28:17Z;Bitcoin needs to grow out of its obsessive adolescence;You cannot challenge currencies, disrupt a global industry and then complain about scrutiny;Newsweek’s flawed attempt to expose a 64-year-old Californian called Dorian Nakamoto as Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor has come at an opportune moment for exponents of the cryptographic currency. It has distracted from a crisis of trust caused by the failure of Mt Gox, the Tokyo Bitcoin exchange.By rights, Bitcoin’s community of enthusiasts, venture capitalists and start-up companies should now be occupied with how it can re-establish credibility after a series of unfortunate events. Instead, much of its energy over the past week has been taken up by fulminating about the magazine’s treatment of Mr Nakamoto, who denies being Bitcoin’s architect.Online forums have filled with virulent criticism, and a lot of sexist abuse, of Leah McGrath Goodman, the reporter who found the man she believes (but has not yet proved) is “Satoshi Nakomoto”, author of the original Bitcoin paper. Devotees have condemned her attempt to “dox” him – expose his identity – whether or not he is their man.The hysteria undermines Bitcoin’s chances of graduating from a hobbyists’ obsession to a mainstream technology. You cannot challenge fiat currencies and disrupt the global payments industry while reacting to any uninvited scrutiny like an adolescent whose parent has opened the bedroom door without knocking. It does not work that way.I say this as a believer in the potential of cryptographic currencies (whether or not Bitcoin survives) to become cheaper and more efficient means of payment and exchange than banks and card companies provide. As I wrote in a previous column, the technology could also permit the exchange of other types of digital contracts.Whatever its underlying potential, Bitcoin faces an immediate crisis. As some 15-minute celebrities have found, the only thing worse than too much attention is no attention at all. Unless it can restore its reputation rapidly, the media and consumers will lose interest.Mt Gox is not the only Bitcoin exchange to have mislaid Bitcoins – several others have suffered from a software loophole known as “transaction malleability” – but it is by far the most serious. It filed for bankruptcy in the US this week, having lost about 745,000 Bitcoins ($472m at Wednesday’s exchange rate), and still has not clearly explained what happened.To the aficionado, Bitcoin’s credibility remains intact. “There has not been a loss of confidence in the technology, but people are newly cautious about trusting Bitcoin companies,” says Edward Felten, professor of computer science at Princeton University.In the case of other exchanges, and perhaps Mt Gox, Bitcoin payments were settled as intended but hackers then altered identifying information on the transactions to fool exchanges into believing that Bitcoins had not changed hands. Mt Gox, the argument goes, was a victim of its own sloppy online bookkeeping rather than a Bitcoin flaw.To the average consumer, this is a distinction without a difference. Being able to trust “Bitcoin” as a technology but not to be sure that your own Bitcoins are safe does not mean much. The basic function of a bank is to store its depositors’ cash more securely than keeping it under the mattress and if Bitcoin cannot match it, little else matters.There has not been a loss of confidence in the technology, but people are newly cautious about trusting Bitcoin companiesThe currency’s more reflective supporters recognise this. “I have met a lot of depressed people, even if they did not lose money themselves,” says Pamir Gelenbe, a partner of Hummingbird Ventures, one London-based Bitcoin investor. “This is a bad event for the ecosystem.”Fixing it will demand both technological and cultural changes. Mt Gox embodied the slapdash, enthusiast phase of Bitcoin. It was founded as an exchange for trading virtual cards in an online game called Magic: The Gathering (from where the Mt Gox name came). Even after it switched to trading Bitcoins, its software was notoriously flawed and accident-prone.The $100m of venture capital invested in Bitcoin in the past couple of years (including $25m in Coinbase, the San Francisco-based digital wallet company in December) has brought professionalism and an experienced group of technology executives to the field. They look on Bitcoin more dispassionately than the earliest adopters.“The recurring theme of Bitcoin is that it is exciting but it has been difficult to find good entrepreneurs. There is a set of guys who got lucky by setting up companies in the early days before it really took off. They were in the right place but were the wrong people,” says one venture capitalist.Some of the new entrants are now trying to fix the flaws that Mt Gox exposed, such as requiring two digital signatures for each transaction (an approach taken by BitGo, a Seattle start-up), rather than letting a hacker who obtains a single signature steal the money. Elliptic, a London-based company, is offering storage of Bitcoins backed by banklike deposit insurance.Such changes raise the possibility of Bitcoin becoming more expensive as safeguards are added (Elliptic charges 2 per cent for its deposit insurance). Goldman Sachs estimated this week that Bitcoin transfers cost 1 per cent of the amount, compared with 2.5 per cent for Visa-type card payments, and adding costs could erode that edge.But Bitcoin’s backers do not have much choice. As a “crisis strategy draft” that circulated at Mt Gox in its last days put it: “At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin, at least for most of the public.” A crisis sometimes makes you grow up fast.john.gapper@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this column:Could the IMF have built Bitcoin? / From Mr Lex Rieffel
164;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;MasterCard, Visa back smartphone payment;;MasterCard and Visa are about to make it easier for consumers to pay for goods with a tap of a smartphone, a payment method frequently promised but rarely delivered.The US credit card groups on Wednesday announced separately their support for a type of technology that could resolve longstanding industry disagreements over how to develop mobile wallets that allow users to store their card data on their phones and then pay with near field communications, or NFC, technology.Interest in mobile payments has surged recently, as companies from PayPal to Visa and start-ups like Square try to find ways to get customers using their phones when buying on and offline. Encouraging mobile payments could let retailers collect better data on their customers, or give them new ways to push location-based offers to potential consumers near their stores.Yet mobile wallets have taken off slowly, in part because paying with cash or credit cards is fine for most consumers, and because existing mobile wallet apps are neither widely accepted by retailers nor easy to use.MasterCard and Visa are hoping to spur the industry by using technology known as “host card emulation”, which allows card data to be stored in the cloud rather than on a chip in the phone, says James Anderson, head of emerging payments at MasterCard.Crucially, the new host card technology means an app, such as a mobile banking app, can serve as a NFC-enabled mobile wallet regardless of which telecom provider the phone is used on.Previous attempts at launching mobile wallets required the co-operation of specific telecom companies.That situation led to the stalemate in the market as T-Mobile, AT&T and others invested in one type of wallet that has struggled to grow, while also blocking wallets developed by others, notably one from Google, from phones on their networks.The new approach around host card emulation will “drive the market quicker, larger, faster – all the good things we want in life,” said Mr Anderson. “We want to have as many options as possible to get people being able to pay with their mobile phones.”Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner, said that host card emulation technology, by freeing consumers from using only a mobile wallet app approved by their carrier, could speed up adoption by giving banks and retailers more freedom to build them in response to consumer demand.“Assuming everything goes well with this implementation, this does provide a valuable avenue for mobile payments,” he said.The first apps using the technology are expected on the market by the end of the year, he said, and for now are available only on Android phones.
165;V;Visa Inc;2014-02-06T11:02:53Z;India tourism: set for visa-on-arrival big boost?;;"India’s long-awaited plan to extend the option of a visa on arrival to more tourists was finally confirmed this week, following discussions between the relevant ministries.By easing the paperwork for international visitors, India hopes to boost the tourism industry which has taken a hit over the past year as concerns over security have hurt India’s reputation.A visa on arrival to India can be used by visitors entering the country for leisure and staying for less than 30 days at just $60 per person.The travel document has been available to citizens of Finland, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Singapore since 2010 and was extended to citizens of six more countries in Asia in 2011.From September it will be extended to citizens of all countries except Pakistan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Somalia.“It’s going to boost the industry tremendously,” says Subhash Goyal, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators. “For the last fifteen to twenty years we’ve been demanding this – we were getting a lot of complaints about the issuance of visas.”The government has conducted several studies which show that the visa on arrivals scheme has provided a boost to India’s tourist arrivals. In the 2013 year 10,482 visas on arrival were issued by July, up 37 per cent year-on-year.Policy makers believe the documentation makes it easier for international visitors to plan a trip to India. It encourages travellers to come to India again and again. And it helps India’s image as a “tourist friendly” nation.The country does, indeed, need help in attracting visitors these days. A rich cultural heritage and the relatively low cost of travelling have put India on the traditional route for backpackers and holiday makers alike. But since the brutal gang rape of a student in New Delhi made headlines in December 2012, concerns around security have grown.In particular, several incidents in the past year have seen tourists at the centre of kidnappings and rape cases. Inevitably, that has hit visitor numbers. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), the industry body, found that the number of foreign visitors into India fell 25 per cent in the first quarter of the 2013 calendar year.The government has been taking steps to counter that image, ordering states to use tourist police and issuing guidelines for the industry.Goyal believes extending the option of a visa on arrival isn’t enough to draw visitors as – despite the name – visitors must still apply online for the documentation before coming to India and then await approval from the authorities.There are also concerns that India will struggle as it opens the floodgates to a huge number of applications – and it has just seven months to build the necessary infrastructure.“My immediate response is that we welcome this move and [it] puts India on par with most other countries that require visas,” Madhavan Menon, managing director for Thomas Cook in India, said in an emailed statement. “The important factor in this is the execution of the arrangement ie the infrastructure and my concerns are around this.”Over 1,000 more staff will be needed at airport immigration counters, according to local media.India is keen to do all it can to encourage tourism given the sector accounted for 11.5 per cent of all employment in the 2012 fiscal year, according to the latest government estimates.As India battles with an unsustainable current account deficit the tourism industry has also become important as a source of foreign currency too. The most recent records show the sector earned foreign exchange worth Rs104.29bn in November, up 7.3 per cent year-on-year.And that should grow. By 2021, the World Travel and Tourism Council expects India to receive 0.8 per cent of the world’s international tourists, which is 11.1m individuals. Meanwhile ASA & Associates expect the industry’s share of national investment to reach 4.8 per cent.The trouble is, it’s not just cumbersome paperwork that is keeping visitors away.Related reading:

166;V;Visa Inc;2014-01-24T16:34:07Z;From the tech backlash to Rouhani being the real deal: Lionel Barber’s 5 Davos takeaways;;I arrived in VIP-full Davos with one prediction in mind: 2014 will be the year the world returns to normality or at least the semblance of normality with the tapered exit from quantitative easing.After three days at high altitude, the prediction is intact and I have five other takeaways.1) Even as a broad recovery based on housing and manufacturing takes hold in the US, there are worries about Europe. The existential threat to the euro is over but Merkel’s Germany has shuffled left, demographics are poor, anti-immigration movements are on the rise, including in the UK, and growth appears terminally tepid. Worries about a China slowdown though are overblown.2) The tech backlash is coming: it was astonishing how much fretting there was about technology as the jobs destroyer not the great liberator. Was it all down to a powerful Economist front cover last week or other troubling numbers about tech killing jobs in the professional services (the banks!) and manufacturing in emerging markets?3) The banks are turning into utilities (with still high salaries) but are making a big effort to clean up their image and rebut Lord Turner’s accusation they are engaged in “socially useless” activities. I attended an impressive Barclays breakfast this morning where Chief Executive Antony Jenkins outlined his charter for lending to the great unbanked. The initiative is three years old but Barclays is now pushing other powerful NGOs like the Clinton Global Initiative and private companies (Accenture, Allianz and Visa) to come aboard and help in places like Africa. It just needs to work and be more than good deeds.4) The Democrats and Republicans are like two heavyweight boxers who have punched themselves senseless and are now propping themselves up in the ring (this is called “coming together” ?) The loose Tea Party talk about debt default is off the agenda – Wall Street and the men and women with the money said no more in 2013 – and therefore we won’t have a long and scary stand off this year. But the White House thinks the Republicans may do something dangerous and eye-catching just for Tea Party show before striking a budget deal.5) President Hassan Rouhani of Iran is for real and he wants a deal to end his country’s isolation. I saw him close-up this week for the second time in two months. And while the session was off the record, he was refreshingly open in private about environmental damage and youth unemployment. He won’t give up Iran’s nuclear energy option (and he does not quite convince why oil- and gas-rich Iran needs nuclear for its energy mix). But the economic stresses are real and his country needs foreign investment. And while Iran can grow five per cent plus this year, Iran’s huge potential will only be realised if sanctions are lifted.Final thought: my bet is President Barack Obama is strong enough to block a new round of congressional sanctions, but a comprehensive deal with Iran will be difficult to do inside 12 months.
167;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Ebay / PayPal: payment denied;Icahn’s proposal to split smacks of opportunism;Ebay management turned the $1.5bn acquisition of PayPal into a business worth $30bn-plus – a rare instance of success in technology dealmaking. Carl Icahn thinks he is wiser than them anyway. His proposal on Wednesday to separate the payment processor from the online retailer (called Marketplaces) reeks of opportunism. Ebay shares had a rare off year in 2013, underperforming the S&P 500 by 20 per cent. Its 2014 profit outlook has also disappointed. But shareholders should give eBay’s bosses the benefit of the doubt for now. If rival Amazon continues to best eBay and payments groups remain the darlings of Wall Street, the PayPal spin-off is a trump card that can be played.The PayPal/Marketplaces conflict reflects the common low growth/high profit schism. Marketplaces’ revenue growth is in the low double digits, while PayPal has been growing at about 20 per cent. While PayPal accounts for 40 per cent of group revenue, Marketplaces represents 40 per cent of operating margin, and that means it still contributes about two-thirds of total profits. And those profits come in handy given that PayPal has spent $1bn on recent acquisitions.What is clear is the hype around payments businesses. Shares in Visa and MasterCard jumped at least 45 per cent in 2013. Alternative payment start-ups Square and Stripe have received multibillion-dollar valuations. A JPMorgan analysis places a 15 times cash flow multiple on PayPal, nearly twice the valuation of Marketplaces. It figures the stock is a fifth undervalued.Profit differential aside, eBay firmly believes that PayPal’s exceptional growth comes from its tight integration with Marketplaces. New shoppers on eBay sign up for PayPal accounts to buy things. And shopper data help PayPal’s risk management. How those benefits break down if the two are separated is murky. But between 2009 and 2012 eBay shares nearly tripled, so management has earned the rope to execute its plan. PayPal is not going anywhere and, as a (passive) investor, neither should Mr Icahn.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
168;V;Visa Inc;2013-12-17T03:37:22Z;Big retailers back Brussels cap on card payment fees;;The chief executives of some of Britain’s largest retailers – including J Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer – have swung behind European Commission proposals to cap “excessive fees” charged by banks for processing card payments.Fees on payments via credit or debit cards cost British retailers £850m per year, according to the British Retail Consortium. Almost 70 per cent of retail sales are now put on plastic.The European Commission this summer proposed limiting charges at 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent for debit and credit cards, respectively. Fees in the UK range from 0.1 per cent up to 2.5 per cent.The Commission also wanted to scrap the “honour all cards rule”, which forces large retailers to accept all major cards. These proposals would save retailers in the UK about £350m per year.If the plans were introduced across the Europe Union, it could save retailers about €4.5bn in annual charges.Card payment providers, such as Visa and MasterCard – which together control about 90 per cent of the market – have criticised the proposals, arguing that retailers will not pass savings on to customers.In a letter sent to MEPs, the chief executives of Kingfisher, Asda, Morrisons, Home Retail Group and Boots – among others – denied that a cap on fees would simply boost their profits.They wrote: “The market in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete on price and value every day and put our customers at the heart of everything we do. Any savings in a reduction in card interchange fees will create capital to enable a range of investments.”The chief executives warned that “any dilution of [the proposals] will simply allow these excessive costs to continue, remove transparency and result in a lack of proper competition within the banking sector”.MEPs will debate the issue in Brussels on Tuesday.
169;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;MasterCard: hat trick?;Shares are pricey but the group is in a long-term growth market;"MasterCard has unveiled not one, not two, but three ways to fiddle with its capital structure: a stock split; a dividend increase; and a share buyback. With a share price approaching $800 and $3.4bn in cash at the end of the last quarter, each of these manoeuvres is understandable.But none should move the share price. A 10-for-1 stock split may make the shares more accessible for retail investors and boost trading. In terms of value, though, it is irrelevant. MasterCard is only cutting its pie into more pieces. Dividends and buybacks simply return to shareholders what they own anyway. There is, however, some value in the message. While the dividend yield will be just 0.6 per cent after the increase – not a level to inspire diehard investors in dividend stocks – an 83 per cent rise plus buyback for up to $3.5bn signals how cash management will work.The shares, up 60 per cent this year, are trading at a pricey 27 times forecast earnings. There is one reason to hold them: the company operates in a long-term growth market. MasterCard and rival Visa run the world’s largest payment networks. The more people buy with debit and credit cards and other forms of electronic payment, the more the groups make. MasterCard is expected to raise earnings per share by about 18 per cent both next year and the year after.MasterCard says that 85 per cent of the world’s retail transactions involve cash or cheques. Believe it and there is plenty of room for the two companies to grow, especially in the developing world. And there is no alternative, with the incumbents’ level of acceptance or penetration. For now. A threat is an evolution in technology that would enable someone else to circumvent MasterCard and Visa. Big, lucrative trends tend to draw deep-pocketed competition.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
170;V;Visa Inc;2013-10-04T14:15:58Z;MasterCard and Visa look to woo Africa’s unbanked;;"As incomes rise in Africa, the battle is on to snap up the millions of ‘unbanked’ – those without a bank account. The potential is vast: the African Development Bank says only 20 per cent of African families have bank accounts.As well as innovative new players, the old global payment technology rivals Visa and MasterCard are keen to join in. Both are looking to enlarge their footprint in different corners of the continent.According to the AfDB, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest banking penetration (the proportion of people with accounts) in the world, standing at an average of 16.6 per cent compared with 63.5 per cent in developing countries. All sorts of products and players are sprouting up – whether it’s from traditionally established banks or from the newer but fiercely competitive mobile banking players such as M-Pesa in Kenya or South African MTN’s Mobile Money Account.But MasterCard and Visa aren’t sitting still. Here are just some of the initiatives in Africa from the two payments giants:Neither Visa or MasterCard give Africa-specific revenue figures in their financial reports. Beyondbrics asked both companies how much they have invested in Africa to date and what are their sales revenues for Africa, but they both declined to reveal their figures.For both companies, this is just the start in Africa. Visa, for example, says it aims to generate 50 per cent of its revenue from markets outside of the US by 2015, and wants to achieve this partly by extending its products areas where electronic payments are not yet widely used – Africa fits that description well. And at the announcement of the MasterCard-branded national identity smart cards, the Nigerian National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) revealed that it aims to introduce more than 100m cards to Nigeria’s citizens.But there are challenges, such as a lack of financial literacy, convincing consumers to trust the formal financial system, limited acceptance among merchants and difficult regulatory environments. Visa told beyondbrics: “It is difficult to educate and get people to understand the value of being formally included. This is a constant effort that we address through our financial inclusion and financial literacy efforts.”MasterCard President Middle East and Africa Region Michael Miebach highlighted the collaborative approach required to extend services in Africa: “Approaching payment infrastructure challenges across the continent requires a new model, where we as a payments technology company partner with governments, banks, merchants, NGOs and other technology companies at a country-level, and where as a result, doing well and doing good go together.”The flurry of initiatives from both companies shows the opportunity in Africa – and also the chance for newer players to win customers.Related reading:

171;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Visa, MasterCard and Amex seek new online payments standard;;Visa, MasterCard and American Express are proposing a new industry standard to make online payments more secure, by eliminating the need to enter account numbers when shopping online or on mobile devices.Instead, customers of the payment companies would be given individual identifying numbers for each of their smartphones or tablets, which they would enter when shopping online. This would create an additional level of security, as it would mean that merchants would not store credit card or account numbers.The proposed standard, to be applied worldwide, will be presented to payment companies and industry trade associations in coming weeks, the companies said in a statement.Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard, said that the proposal was for “a special and different number tied to that particular device. A one-time set-up, so that every time you use that device, you use that special number.”Other payment companies will be invited to adopt this new standard.Mr McLaughlin, who compared the proposed framework to the collective use of a magnetic stripe on plastic payment cards, said: “We want to agree to adhere to certain standards at the industry level.”MasterCard added that it would be “premature” to discuss the costs of implementation before the sector had agreed on a common framework.Peter Roe, research director at analysts TechMarketView, welcomed the move to tighten security. He noted that a “big leak of customer data” had the potential to shake confidence in mobile payments.“People I’ve been talking to are very aware of the need for greater security, so this is a good move. At the same time, payment authorities around the world are wanting new entrants, and that will reduce the power and market share of credit card operators.”The proposal comes as growing competition in mobile payment solutions has started to force down prices in Europe. Mobile payment start-ups SumUp and iZettle recently began charging retailers less than the standard 2.75 per cent transaction fee.Mr Roe suggested that innovators such as Square might be reluctant to use a system mandated by the credit card companies as “new companies with new ideas want to differentiate [themselves].”Mike Matan, head of Global Network Business at American Express, said in a statement that working together to form a global standard would help “drive the rapid adoption and expansion of digital payments”.Worldwide shipment of mobile phones with near-field communication technology– used for mobile payments – is predicted to rise fourfold between 2010 and 2014, according to iSuppli, the market research firm.
172;V;Visa Inc;2013-09-17T16:01:51Z;Education: Gaming aims to take the fear out of finance;Applications can boost financial skills;An imaginary world filled with fantasy creatures is helping children learn about the value of money. Using the app, Green$treets: Unleash the Loot!, they can earn virtual cash by planting a garden or purchase decorations for a tree house while learning basic financial concepts such as earning money, making spending decisions, saving and budgeting.The app is an attempt to overcome the biggest hurdle facing those wanting to increase consumers’ grasp of money management – the image many people have that personal finance is stressful and dull.“The fundamental problem is that it’s just not very interesting,” says Mark Guinibert, a partner at KPMG, the consultancy.It is a view shared by Jason Alderman, who runs the global financial education programmes at Visa, the credit card company. “One of the biggest challenges of financial literacy, regardless of what technology you’re using, is that the combination of fear, shame and boredom is a lethal cocktail,” he says.As a result, the apps and games that Visa is now designing as part of its financial literacy programmes include one that taps into the popularity of sport. Financial Soccer (called Financial Football in some markets) is a free online video game that tests players’ financial management skills.Mr Alderman argues that technology can encourage people who might otherwise shy away from the subject to start thinking about how to manage their money. “There is no app that can make you financially literate,” he says. “But it can be a gateway to realising that the subject doesn’t need to be terrifying.”Mobile and game technologies can add an element of fun to help consumers improve their money management skills.In the US, for example, PNC Bank has created a mobile phone app to make saving money more entertaining. The Punch the Pig app allows customers to transfer money from their current to their savings account automatically whenever they punch (by shaking their phone) the piggy bank on the screen.“ ‘Gamification’ is a way of getting people to save and put money away,” says Mr Guinibert. “There’s something in our brains that responds to that kind of addictive behaviour.”Familiarity plays a role, too, a factor that the Green$treets app taps into, since its creatures are the creations of Tom Hester, character designer for Shrek, the computer-animated film franchise.Even in very different settings, similar principles apply. When Opportunity International – which provides poor communities in developing countries with financial services – designs its education programmes, it taps into popular culture.In Uganda, where soap operas are widely watched, it creates dramas with similar plot lines that include messages about things such as the importance of having savings accounts. The organisation is starting to equip its loan officers with tablets, and it sees the potential of taking these messages to a larger number of people.“It’s about not trying to introduce something new but using what is already working well,” says Rosa Wang, director of mobile money at Opportunity International.Mobile devices offer other advantages when it comes to financial literacy – intimacy. “Money management concerns some of the most private information we have,” says Mr Alderman. “And a phone is a screen just for you.”For microfinance institutions, the mobile phone is a way of helping clients keep on track with loan repayments. Opportunity International is among those using text message notifications to borrowers’ as reminders that their payments are due.If mobile technology is a channel for delivering financial information that people can access in private, social media is a highly public technology.For this reason, Mark Guinibert believes banks will have to tread carefully when using social media as a money management tool. “People find it hard enough to talk to their friends about this stuff,” he says.Nevertheless, some banks are experimenting with social media as a means of increasing financial literacy. For Visa, the technology provides a way of using shared concerns to raise awareness of the importance of budgeting.In the US, the company’s Tooth Fairy app and Facebook calculator help parents – who often worry about how much money to leave for children after they lose a tooth – decide on the appropriate amount by letting them see what other families have left under their child’s pillow.Meanwhile, in India, ICICI Bank is using Facebook to encourage savings among younger customers. With an iWish account, customers can choose when and how much to deposit. They can post their savings goals on a Facebook page so that their friends and family can track the saver’s progress and make contributions from their own accounts.It is perhaps no surprise that ICICI Bank has targeted younger customers with its iWish account. As the younger generation of digital natives become bank clients, they are likely to be less reluctant than older people to use social media to discuss their personal finances.“With a younger, more online, more confident user base, it is viable,” says Mr Guinibert. “It might not happen today, but it is going to happen.”
173;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;A handy guide to rocky terrain ahead;‘Mobile Strategy’ by Dirk Nicol manages to address complex issues without being overly technical;"Mobile Strategy: How Your Company Can Win by Embracing Mobile Technologies, by Dirk Nicol, IBM Press, RRP£18.99/$29.99It is unusual to come across a book about developing a company mobile strategy and not be disappointed by it. Such efforts often stray either into technobabble or are peppered with the generalities and jargon of management consultancy.Dirk Nicol avoids both and provides a genuinely useful manual for executives pondering the complexities of enterprise mobility. This no doubt reflects his experience as a programme director for IBM’s mobile strategy and product management.The forward by Bob Suitor, a vice-president of business analytical and mathematical sciences at IBM, points out that a successful corporate mobile strategy is about more than handing out the latest smartphones or tablets to staff, something many companies have yet to realise.He also notes that, “mobile is not just about the latest smartphone or tablet, or 3G vs 4G vs WiFi, or even how big your device’s app store is compared to mine. The societal changes being driven by the significant use of highly programmable and interactive mobile devices with fast connectivity are affecting healthcare, banking, retail, mining and almost all industries with which we engage.”As the author says, mobile’s opportunities are enormous – he goes so far as to say its development is a milestone in computing, of the same magnitude as the mainframe, the PC or the internet’s commercialisation.Mr Nicol underlines the fact that many companies considering harnessing mobile’s power face considerable challenges, not least the constant flux the technology seems to be in, while customer – and employee – expectations are often sky-high.Also, and perhaps most importantly, “security and privacy [is] a fundamental issue because [a] device contains a mixture of personal and corporate data”.Mr Nicol identifies the main question executives have as ‘‘How do I get started?” and the rest of his book is mostly a practical guide to answering that question against the backdrop of trends such as the consumerisation of IT – or bring your own device, to work – though I would have liked a more detailed examination of the use of tablet devices in enterprises and by clients.The author argues that the first step to developing a successful mobile strategy is to define what having one can add to the value of your business and says, “in the end, mobile technologies can transform business in untold ways. However, the potential value can be lost if you do not execute correctly.”For example, the smartphone, he says, has three important capabilities that, when brought together, can become transformational: contextual interacting (enabling a user to interact with other people, their environment and data); mobile intelligence (having powerful computational resources when you need them); and engagement (delivering an easy, helpful user experience).The author explains the implications of these attributes in chapters that consider aspects such as frameworks, development, security and the management needed to bring about mobile business transformation, as well as one on international considerations.Each chapter follows a similar simple structure: an introduction; key considerations for a mobile strategy; and a conclusion summarising the main concepts. It is a structure that guides the reader through what otherwise could be confusing territory.My favourite section comes almost at the end, where Mr Nicol briefly outlines specific case studies including Air Canada, Visa and Tesco’s Home Plus service in South Korea, although these would have benefited from being longer.But, overall, this is an easy book to read, and it manages to address complex issues of developing a mobile strategy without being overly technical."
174;V;Visa Inc;2013-09-17T16:01:51Z;Contactless payments: Convenience is the key factor likely to win over customers;Weve offers payment technology via a new generation of mobile phone chips;A consortium of mobile phone operators in the UK has ambitions to sell banks a high-tech way of keeping customers loyal.Launched in 2012 by Vodafone, EE and O2, Weve offers payment technology via a new generation of mobile phone chips.These work in the same way as contactless payments tap and pay debit cards, by employing short-range radio waves known as near-field communications (NFC).Banks feel that they missed a trick in allowing online commerce companies such as PayPal to dominate internet shopping. They see mobile phone technologies as a way to reinvigorate their relationship with a younger generation of customers.The big question is whether NFC will live up to its hype before some other emerging technology takes the mobile payments prize.Tony Moretta, a veteran of NatWest bank and credit card giant Visa, is marketing director at Weve. He says the UK has 30m credit and debit cards that are equipped with contactless payment chips, so consumers are accustomed to making payments by waving a chipped device at a card reader in a shop or restaurant.Mr Moretta anticipates NFC capacity will be enhanced by Weve’s mobile operator backers in the same way as a bank updates plastic cards.New mobile devices will sport an NFC-compatible chip and, when enough are in circulation, banks can alert their customers to the options they have for using these services.The company says it will carry out the technical integration between bank accounts and the NFC chips, giving each bank a single point of contact that will provide access to the multitude of phones that are available from the group’s backers.The theory is that consumers will leap at the speed and convenience of contactless payments as banks load the ability to use debit cards on to mobile phones.Banks will control the branding of the service, adding extra promotions such as discount deals with retailers. The resulting avalanche of information about spending habits could put banks on a par with supermarkets in terms of their future ability to mine and exploit data from customer transactions.Mr Moretta anticipates Weve’s banking clients should be able to launch services by the end of 2014. He thinks the frantic pace of change in mobile commerce is a powerful incentive for them to sign up. “Banks are behind the consumer in terms of using mobile payments technology,” Mr Moretta says.“If the banks don’t do this soon, someone else will,” he adds.Market observers say this rapid rate of change may also trip up Weve. Neil Burton, director of product strategy at cross-border payments group Earthport, warns that “the rate at which mobile technology changes is very quick, possibly faster than the banks can match”.Apple has held out from including NFC compatibility on the iPhone, and it is clear that Weve can only be one element in a wider mobile strategy for banks.Paul Berney, European managing director at the Mobile Marketing Association, thinks Weve is pointing banks in the right direction, although he believes Apple’s eventual embrace of NFC will prove crucial.“Weve is preparing them for the future, it is just a question of time,” he says.
175;V;Visa Inc;2013-09-15T13:53:13Z;When market movers are the index makers;Investors have outsourced much power to the index providers;Who has the power to move markets? Often some unlikely candidates.As everyone learnt during the global financial crisis, rating agencies had been given too much power. This was the side-effect of regulations that placed limits on the bonds that banks or fund managers could hold, based on their ratings. The result was to outsource due diligence to the agencies. This put far more weight on the opinion of one or two analysts than they were ever designed to bear.Another division of Standard & Poor’s also has far more power than was intended. Those who draw up stock indexes, in a world ever more driven by passive investment, have immense power. The world’s most powerful stockpicker, in effect, is the governing body of the S&P500 index, as some $2.14tn is tied to it.As with the reforms that overwhelmed the rating agencies, the moves that gave the indexers such power made sense individually. But judging by the way markets moved last week when several of the world’s best-known indices made slight changes, traders do not understand how the indices work.The most widely covered move last week involved the Dow Jones Industrial Average, still easily the world’s best-known stock index. On Tuesday, its governing committee announced it would remove Hewlett-Packard, Bank of America and Alcoa in favour of Visa, Goldman Sachs, and Nike, prompting a flurry of commentary about the changing face of corporate America, as well as a move to buy the new entrants. Goldman far outperformed BofA that morning, while both Visa and Nike enjoyed gains well ahead of the market.Should it receive such attention? Unlike past decisions to axe Woolworth or Eastman Kodak, the adjustments were not an attempt to remove incurable laggards (BofA and Hewlett-Packard are both recovering after bad times, while Alcoa is in a cyclical industry).Rather, the decision was made because the Dow is weighted by share price, rather than market value, and the three exiting stocks had low share prices, giving them minimal impact on the overall index. The same problem affected the entrants. Apple, the obvious replacement for H-P, would have distorted the index, as its $500 share price would have swamped all others.Thus this was an exercise in remedying the Dow’s technical inadequacies. Anyone serious about tracking markets would recognise those technical inadequacies as insuperable and ignore the Dow.On Wednesday, it was the turn of the FTSE 100, covering the hundred biggest London-quoted stocks. Unlike the Dow, the FTSE announces its quarterly timetable in advance. It was plain to anyone paying attention that ENRC, Serco and Wood Group would leave, while Sports Direct, Mondi and Hellenic Coca-Cola would join.This did not stop noticeable pops in the stocks of Sports Direct, a fast-growing UK sports retailer, and Mondi, a paper and packaging group, even though both had already enjoyed spectacular rallies this year on the road to gaining entry to the FTSE.And like the Dow, the FTSE 100 must be treated with care. As shown by the replacement of a Kazakh miner with a Greek Coca-Cola bottler, the index is a strange amalgam, bearing little relation to the UK economy. Its weighting in technology companies is just under 1 per cent (Arm Holdings and Sage), while more than a quarter is devoted to energy and resources plays. Few should want to base any investment decision on it – unless they are determined only ever to invest in sterling, avoiding any foreign exchange risk, and only to buy very large stocks.Finally, there came the S&P500. It announced late on Wednesday that two companies – Applied Micro Devices and SAIC – would exit, to be replaced by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Ametek, an electronic instruments group.AMD’s share price currently languishes where it did in 1981. It was the smallest stock in the S&P. Meanwhile, Vertex and Ametek were the largest stocks in the S&P MidCap 400, so their inclusion was logical. They still gained 2.7 and 5.7 per cent respectively at Thursday’s opening.S&P’s methodology is clearer than that of most peers, and it retains discretion over its exact membership, making it harder for traders to “front-run” changes. Its members are not the 500 biggest US stocks, but are adjusted to mirror the sectoral balance of the market as a whole. But this discretion creates controversy. Google joined years after many thought it should. And Facebook, a far larger company than Vertex or Ametek, is still excluded because it has yet to make a profit for four quarters in a row.So without meaning it, investors have outsourced much power to the index providers. Judging by this week’s market moves, they have done so without truly understanding what goes in to the indices they are tracking. This is not healthy.john.authers@ft.com
176;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:06:37+0000;Netflix takes a starring role;;US indices were poised for a fifth consecutive day of gains, helped by Netflix, which broke through the $300 level to reach a record high.The content streaming and DVD service was up 6.4 per cent to $313.06 after analysts at RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley increased price targets for the company.Netflix is more than 238 per cent higher since the beginning of the year, having recovered from its low of $53.05 hit after a plan to split its DVD and streaming business was met with subscriber cancellations and investor scepticism.Netflix was not alone on Tuesday, as the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,683.99, with all 10 major S&P sectors posting gains.The industrial and financial sectors led the way, up 1.4 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively. Another strong data release from China, this time indicating that industrial output, investment and retail sales had improved, helped to boost some of the largest US manufacturers. Vanguard Industrials ETF was up 1.4 per cent to $88.23.General Electric added 2.1 per cent to $23.87, Honeywell International gained 2.1 per cent to $84.13, and United Technologies ticked up 1.7 per cent to $106.26.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6 per cent to 3,729.02, but was hampered by a sharp drop in Apple shares following the company’s announcement of its newest slate of iPhones.Apple, which traded slightly lower before the release event, extended losses to 2.3 per cent at $494.64, taking the company back below the $500 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 15,191.06.Nike, Goldman Sachs and Visa all received a boost on news that they will be added to the Dow.All three companies moved sharply higher, with Nike up 2.2 per cent to $66.82, Goldman shares 3.5 per cent higher to $165.14, and Visa 3.4 per cent better to $184.59 after the news broke on Tuesday morning.Nike has enjoyed a strong run in 2013 for consumer stocks and posted strong earnings thanks to higher prices and cheaper materials.The sports apparel company’s shares are up 29.5 per cent on the year to date. The companies will replace Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard after the close of trading on Friday September 20.The three spurned stocks took the news in their stride, with Alcoa off 0.4 per cent to $8.05, Hewlett-Packard 0.4 per cent lower to $22.27, and Bank of America advancing 0.9 per cent to $14.61.Delta Air Lines rose sharply in its first day on the S&P 500. Shares in the carrier were up 4 per cent to $22.63 and are now up 13.8 per cent since Monday.Urban Outfitters and ConAgra were among the day’s worst performers on news they were in danger of missing earnings expectations.Urban fell 10.2 per cent to $38.35 after a regulatory filing showed that third-quarter same-store sales were below analyst estimates. The drop took the retailer into negative territory for 2013, off 2.6 per cent.ConAgra shares dropped 6 per cent to $31.54 after the company reduced its 2014 guidance.BlackBerry was off 5.1 per cent to $10.94, continuing a recent volatile run as sale rumours swirled around the handset maker. Reports on Tuesday morning said the company had laid off a chunk of its US sales force.Shares in BlackBerry are off 21.6 per cent in the past three months.Tuesday’s gains put the S&P 500 up 3.1 per cent during its September streak. However, it has been overshadowed by an even more impressive run from the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks.The Russell is up 4.4 per cent in September, taking it near its 2013 highs of 1,063.52.However, the US indices are not alone. In the past six sessions, Tokyo’s Nikkei is up 6.3 per cent, the Shanghai Composite has risen 6.7 per cent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index is better by 3.6 per cent.
177;V;Visa Inc;2013-09-10T18:52:30Z;Goldman joins Dow in big stocks shake-up;;Credit cards, investment banking and running shoes are coming to the world’s most recognisable stock market benchmark, reflecting the shift in the US economy from industry to services and consumer goods.Visa, Goldman Sachs and Nike, three major companies with high equity prices, are joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the select group of 30 companies that form one of America’s most well-known stock benchmarks.The trio replace Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard, marking a trend away from commodities, commercial banking and technology.The move is part of a shake-up designed to boost the relevance of the benchmark, in a year when the price-weighted Dow has lagged behind the overall performance of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.S&P Dow Jones Indices said the changes were prompted by the low stock price of the three companies slated for removal and the index committee’s desire to diversify the Dow so that it more accurately reflects the shifting undercurrents of the economy.“I think this is an improvement in the Dow and makes it a better measure of the market,” said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “By putting stocks with higher prices we get a better indication of the market as well as of the economy.”“These higher-priced companies are a better reflection of the American economy,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. The move would probably bring a lot more attention to them, he said. “A lot of people know Visa as a credit card company, maybe less so as an individual stock.”A unique feature of the Dow is that the benchmark is price weighted, which means higher-priced stocks drive its overall performance, both up and down. This is one reason why very high-priced stocks such as Apple and Google are widely viewed as being unable to feature in the Dow, as their share of the benchmark would dominate its direction.Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said the new additions meant that based on current prices, Visa would become the second most important stock in the index and Goldman the third. The bank was among the strongest performers on the S&P 500 index on Tuesday, up 3.5 per cent to $165.14.“By definition, then, the Dow is going to look and act very differently. Leaving aside Nike replacing Hewlett-Packard, you’ve replaced two stocks that essentially don’t matter in Alcoa and Bank of America with two that do,” he said.The changes are the latest since UnitedHealth Group, the insurance company, replaced Kraft Foods in the index last year and the biggest change since 2004 when AIG, Pfizer and Verizon replaced Eastman Kodak, AT&T and International Paper.Mr Ablin said the changes could give the Dow a boost, but warned that, in the past, new entrants had marked a market peak, such as Microsoft joining in late 1999 just before the tech bubble burst a year later.“Nike is a consumer discretionary company and that sector has outperformed for the past five years. Had they made these changes five years ago the Dow would be a lot higher now.”The changes, the first “three for three” to the index since April 2004, will be effective with the opening of trading on Monday September 23.While professional investors generally use the S&P 500 as their performance benchmark, the Dow is widely referenced by the media and followed by main street investors, given its long history and status of reflecting the broad economy.S&P estimates that $2.14tn in funds follow the S&P 500, with just $37bn tracking the Dow.At the end of trading on Tuesday in New York, shares in Nike were up 2.2 per cent to $66.82 and Visa had added 3.4 per cent to $184.59. Alcoa was down 0.3 per cent to $8.06, HP had fallen 0.4 per cent to $22.27 and Bank of America was up 0.9 per cent to $14.61.
178;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Big Mother is watching you;Technology developers are allowing parents to keep their children under close surveillance;When Apple introduced the Find My iPhone app three years ago, its aim was to help people locate their lost smartphones. But EJ Hilbert, a 43-year-old former FBI officer, had a better idea – installing the app on his three children’s devices, so that he could track them wherever they went.“They have it on their phone and that’s the way it’s going to be,” says Mr Hilbert, whose day job is investigating cyber crime.By adapting the Find My iPhone app, Mr Hilbert is part of a wider trend. Until recently technology gave power to the children. Now it is starting to give something back to the parents.Yesterday’s parents did not know how to record their offspring’s favourite television programme. Today’s parents can record the child’s every move, email and purchase – with the help of a variety of new gadgets.“There are huge opportunities for disruption,” says James Wise, a venture investor at Balderton Capital. “The challenge for entrepreneurs is to build something both the parents and their children want to use.”For many parents, however, the priority is protecting their children from online pornography and bullying.In the UK, all internet customers are to be asked by the end of next year if they want to activate pornography filters. TalkTalk, the first provider to have offered the filters, says that about one in three households activate the filter.Parents worried about cyber bullying can go further. Dozens of software packages are available to install on desktops and mobiles to check children’s browsing history and read their emails and messages. By logging keystrokes, the programs can give parents access to sites and passwords.“Up until 13 or 14, it should be common practice for parents to sit down and go through what their children have been looking at [online], and who they are talking to,” says psych­ologist Catherine Steiner-Adair. “There is a whole new area requiring parental input, supervision and control.”This kind of surveillance should be done openly, she says. Parents should explain that they will be watching their children’s online activities as a condition for handing over a laptop or smartphone.Even so, that approach alarms some. “If very intrusive surveillance is deemed the norm during childhood, why would you ever expect privacy as an adult?” says Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, the privacy campaign group.Under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed by the US and European countries, children have a right to privacy from their parents, though the extent depends on their maturity.Parental surveillance technologies, which began with spy cameras hidden in teddy bears, have grown faster in the US than Europe. “There is a slight sense in America and increasingly the UK that, if you’ve got a problem, you should solve it with technology,” says Paul Bernal, a law lecturer at East Anglia University.Even parents may find the result creepy, however. Mathew Ingram, a tech­nology journalist, monitored his daughters’ online activities for nearly a decade. “I believed that what I was doing was justified because I wanted to protect my daughters from themselves,” he wrote recently. “In the end, I decided that the loss of trust was actually much worse than anything I was theoretically saving them from. ”Older kids, too, are under closer surveillance. With insurance premiums for young drivers rising, more parents are looking to install telematics boxes in their cars to monitor how their children drive. The boxes monitor actions such as ac­celeration, cornering, average speed and time of day. The data are available to the insurer and the policyholder – who is often the parent.“It’s inevitable that telematics will just be a normal thing for an under 25 to have,” says Charlotte Halkett of Insurethebox, which has about 50,000 parents with young drivers on its books.From apps to hardware, a range of devices are aimed at worried parents, including:●Life360 The app, left, which tracks the movements of family members, claims more than 30m users and has raised $10m in venture funding.●Filip Expected to launch this year, this smartwatch is designed to be worn by children. It can detect lost toddlers wherever they may be, including indoors.●Bemilo On the UK’s “safest mobile network”, children can only contact the phone numbers that their parents have authorised.Traditional insurers have also laun­ched telematics policies. “It’s only going to grow,” says Paul Felton, head of telematics at Direct Line. “More people are willing to share data and rec­eive something back for it. It’s all a trade-off.”The possibilities need not stop there.Tracking toddlers presents its own challenges. Sten Kirkbak was working in a telecommunications company when he lost sight of his son in a shopping centre: “It took a while for me to reflect on it, and even longer before I told my wife.” He came up with the idea of Filip, a smartwatch worn by children that tells parents where they are and allows voice calls. It has less functionality than a smartphone, which is the point of the device. “Approximately 70 per cent of parents in the US say they don’t want to buy their child a smartphone before the age of 12 or 13,” says Mr Kirkbak.Filip has raised $10m and plans to go into production this year. Because GPS does not work indoors, the smartwatch needs to run on WiFi and mob­ile phone signal too, which will push up the cost. The device is expected to retail at up to $200, with a $20 month­ly phone contract. But the big constraint is simplicity, rather than price, says Mr Kirkbak: “Everything has to be controlled from an app. Parents do not have time to read user manuals to control complex technology.”Many parents would like an insight into a child’s school performance. ClassDojo, a US-based service, allows teachers to email frequent reports to parents on their child’s behaviour.There is also parental interest in tracking how children spend their pocket money. Visa and MasterCard offer pre-paid debit cards that allow parents to see where their children have spent their money. This incarnation may not be foolproof. “If my parents gave me a pre-paid debit card to track my spending, the first thing I would do is buy an­other pre-paid debit card so they couldn’t,” jokes Jim McKelvey, co-founder of payments company Square.As more payments shift online, the opportunities increase for parents to peer over their child’s shoulder.But, as Mr McKelvey’s remarks highlight, children may try to outsmart the technology.Snapchat, a messaging service where the photos and text self-destruct after 15 seconds, allows children to communicate away from parents’ gaze. Those who want to play truantwithout being tracked can give their phones to friends who are at school. Some children also have two Facebook profiles, and accept their parents as friends on just one of them.The growth of parental surveillance is here to stay. “‘Won’t someone think of the children?’ is going to be a very potent marketing call for many years to come, as it has been for many years in the past,” says Mr Pickles.There is only one problem. If it is becoming ever easier to track a family member’s movements online and offline, what’s to stop the kids monitoring their parents?
179;V;Visa Inc;2013-08-18T11:58:29Z;Boom in plastic money as Nigeria spends, spends, spends;;"In 2002, when Mitchell Elegbe was starting his technology business, there were few proper bank cards in Nigeria, ATMs were rare and there was no inter-connectivity between banks. Drawing money meant walking into your branch, collecting a token indicating a number in the queue, and returning several hours later in the hope of being near the teller.“People used to keep a lot of money at home,” said Mr Elegbe. “We thought: why can’t people have cash just-in-time.”So his fledgling company built a “switching” infrastructure to connect the different banks. Interswitch also provided the technology for ATM cards, in the hope of becoming the Nigerian equivalent of Visa or MasterCard.A decade on, and the two American payment giants are scrambling to play catch-up in Africa’s second-biggest economy. Today, Nigeria has nearly 12,000 ATMs, 131,000 point-of-sales machines and several internet payment portals. Of the 25m bank cards in circulation, more than 18m carry Interswitch’s “Verve” brand, Mr Elegbe says.Its success is a clear example of the first-mover advantage is Nigeria, where for years the difficult operating conditions caused many multinationals to sit on the sidelines.With the economy expanding steadily at between 6 and 7 per cent a year since 2007, ever more foreign companies are looking for a way in, from supermarket chains such as Carrefour, which recently announced a deal to expand into west Africa, to Ermenegildo Zegna, the luxury men’s brand. And, as data from the banking sector show, later is better than never, for there is still huge room for growth.As in many other African countries, access to financial services has traditionally been limited to the wealthier class in Nigeria. In recent years, however, banks have courted lower-income customers. The number of people with bank accounts grew from 18.3m in 2008 to 28.6m in 2012, according to Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access, (EFInA), an organisation that promotes financial inclusion in the country.Even so, that represents just one in three Nigerian adults, compared with the two in three who formally bank in South Africa, the continent’s largest economy. Nearly 60m Nigerian adults – out of a fast-growing population of 160m people– do not use traditional banking services.“We have this massive market, and that gives us a natural advantage over other countries,” said Mr Elegbe, the MD of Interswitch, whose shareholders now include four local banks, the private equity firm Helios and the International Finance Corporation. “There’s still a huge opportunity to bring more people into the banking system.”Nigeria presents its own unique challenges too, from the chronic power outages that require standalone ATM’s to run on generators much of the day, to its reputation for fraud. In its early years, Interswitch used magnetic stripe cards that were susceptible to being cloned. Mr Elegbe said that fighting swindlers became “my full-time job”. Then Visa and MasterCard, whose presence in sub-Saharan Africa had mainly been limited to countries that drew foreign tourists, such as Kenya and South Africa, entered the market with chip-and-pin cards.The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) mandated that this become the new standard, and Interswitch adopted the technology for its Verve cards. Scamming has now been greatly reduced – by 90 per cent, the CBN says – and is today a much smaller issue than people might imagine, said Ade Ashaye, country manager for Visa.“[By coming in later] we have not repeated the mistakes made in other markets,” he said. “Fraud on our cards issued in Nigeria is significantly lower than global averages.”At the same time, spending on plastic is rising fast. According to the CBN, the volume of card purchases and ATM withdrawals nearly tripled between 2009 and 2011. The vast majority of transactions are made using savings account or debit cards; since Nigeria’s banking crash in 2008, when reckless lending was common, the percentage of bank customers holding credit cards has fallen from 12 per cent to 5 per cent, according to EFInA.One reason for the surge in e-purchases is the CBN’s efforts to promote cashless transactions, which has seen handheld point-of-sales terminals installed everywhere from church donation booths to hairdressers. Another is the rise of internet shopping and sites, such as Paga and Interswitch’s Quickteller that facilitate money transfers, bill payments and airtime purchases.MasterCard, which formally moved into the market in 2010, has seen a strong growth in revenues, according to Omokehinde Ojomuyide, its business head for west Africa, as people have become more comfortable using their cards. The company has an agreement with the government to rollout 13m MasterCard- branded national identity cards that will enable people to load money and make electronic payments.Along with Visa and Interswitch, MasterCard is also working with overseas vendors to improve acceptance of cards issued in Nigeria, which are sometimes still rejected because of a fear of fraud.“Like it or not, Nigerians spent a lot of money abroad,” said Mrs Ojomuyide. “There’s no reason that they should not get the same services as anywhere else in the world.”"
180;V;Visa Inc;2013-07-31T19:00:21Z;Banks hit by debit card cap fee ruling;;The Federal Reserve was criticised on Wednesday for being too soft on the financial industry after a judge ruled that limits on debit card fees charged to retailers were not tough enough.Richard Leon, a district judge, found that a cap on “interchange fees” paid by retailers on debit card transactions had been set too high and should be lowered, in a decision that the American Bankers Association warned would have “disastrous consequences” for the banks.Visa shares fell more than 10 per cent immediately after the ruling.US Congress introduced the limit in 2010 and told the Fed to set the cap at an appropriate level. The original provision was fiercely opposed by the banks, which have since suffered a multibillion-dollar hit to revenues.But retailers said the cap had been set too high and Judge Leon agreed on Wednesday. He said the Fed had taken account of too many costs when setting the cap, including that of dealing with fraud, and it should be lowered.Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator who sponsored the cap, celebrated the court’s decision. He attacked the Fed for being too soft in its original “decision to bend to the lobbying by the big banks and card giants”.A spokesperson for the Fed said it was “reviewing the judge’s opinion”.The ABA said it was “deeply disappointed” and attacked the “price controls” as “further lining the pockets of our nation’s big-box retailers at their own customers’ expense”. The ABA said the Fed should deploy “all legal means” to fight the decision.MasterCard, which is less reliant than Visa on debit cards and which reported improved results on Wednesday, fell more than 4 per cent following the ruling, but closed up 1.5 per cent in New York. Visa closed down 7.5 per cent.The Fed had argued that it was free to consider costs not specifically banned by the law.“Not quite!” wrote the judge at the district court in Washington. “If I were to accept the Board’s argument, then every term in the statute would have to be specifically defined or otherwise be deemed ambiguous. This result makes no sense, and more importantly, it is not the law.”He found the Fed’s interpretation of the law “utterly indefensible” and said it had “shoehorned a whole array of excluded costs into the interchange fee standard”.The case was brought by a collection of retailers and trade associations, including NACS, the convenience store lobby group, and the National Retail Federation.Banks have considered introducing fees to consumers to make up for the revenue shortfall but both Bank of America and Wells Fargo have dropped the idea amid fears of a consumer backlash.Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, has criticised the limit as an undue interference in free markets.The court ruling comes as the European Commission takes aim at fees with its own caps. MasterCard has argued that the “coerced reduction of interchange fees” in various countries has backfired, with cards becoming more expensive while retail prices barely change. In Australia, “the merchant pocketed the reduction”, it argued to the commission.The payments network reported a 19 per cent year-on-year increase in second-quarter net income to $848m on Wednesday on revenue that rose 15.2 per cent to $2.1bn.
181;V;Visa Inc;2013-07-05T11:35:08Z;Polish banks form m-payment JV;;"A lot of the leading innovations in payment systems are coming from the world’s more peripheral financial markets, a trend reinforced by a recent decision by six Polish banks to band together to create a mobile phone-based payment system.The six, led by PKO BP, the country’s biggest bank, are setting up a joint venture that will allow clients with a special smartphone application to make payments debiting their bank accounts using one-time codes generated by the mobile phones.The codes can be punched into a merchant’s debit/credit card pin pad, or they can be used to send money from one account to another or to another person to withdraw funds from an ATM.PKO, which set up its IKO system earlier this year, said that it was the largest such project in Europe. Spain and the UK also have mobile payments systems, but largely pushed by telecoms companies rather than financial institutions. PKO’s system, which started in March, has 40,000 users.The six banks account for 70 per cent of the Polish banking market. If the system is popular it could provide formidable competition for traditional credit and debit cards managed by Visa and Mastercard. The new system also plans to charge merchants lower transaction fees than those taken by the traditional card issuers.“The banks are simply interested in having people use their services and in allowing people to use the service they prefer,” said Jakub Grzechnik, head of the payments office at PKO and of the joint venture set up by the banks. Although PKO had set up the system as an open platform, other banks were reluctant to join because they were worried about their data flowing through PKO’s systems. The joint venture creates a separate data stream which ends that danger.Poles still prefer to use cash for most of their transactions, so if the system catches on it could provide a large boost to bank profits. Poles have about 34m payment cards – one of the lowest card-per-head ratios in the EU – and card use is just a third of the EU average, according to a study by the central bank. The banks also found that thousands of small merchants still refuse to accept cards because of the associated costs.The joint venture is expected to be operational by the end of the year.Other emerging markets have moved strongly into mobile payments. Africa’s M-Pesa system, first launched in Kenya, has spread to other African countries. Turkey is also making strides in developing a mobile-based payment system.Related reading:

182;V;Visa Inc;2013-06-24T19:32:50Z;Vocalink to launch Zapp mobile payments scheme;;More shoppers are set to make payments using their mobile phones, after the organisation behind the Direct Debit scheme unveiled an initiative to link banks and retailers.Vocalink, which runs the UK’s payment infrastructure, said on Monday that customers would be able to pay at the till without a credit or debit card, by loading a mobile app and then scanning a barcode, or tapping a reader, with their phones.The service, called Zapp, is scheduled to launch in mid-2014 at a development cost of £100m.“This is one of those once-in-a-generation propositions – bringing on board acquirers, retailers, banks and customers,” said Peter Keenan, chief executive of Zapp.Vocalink’s owners, the high-street banks, have injected £16m into Zapp, and the organisation is now looking for outside investment to fund the additional cost.Mobile payments have so far remained largely a technology of the future, with banks, telecoms companies and start-ups launching rival initiatives.Research organisation Gartner noted in a recent report that some high-profile services, including Google Wallet, had struggled to gain users.“The zeitgeist is that the world is exploring ways of going straight to the bank account,” said Dave Birch, a consultant at Consult Hyperion. “In the US, the drive is by the retailers, whereas here it’s Vocalink . . . The most important thing is that payments are interesting again.”It is not yet clear whether any banks have committed to Zapp, with some apparently surprised by Vocalink’s announcement.Lloyds Banking Group and HSBC told the Financial Times that they were considering joining the scheme. But Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, RBS and Santander have all signed up to a separate initiative, also to be powered by Vocalink, whereby individuals will be able to make payments to other people using their phone numbers.That project – designed to overcome people’s reluctance to disclose their account details – is due to launch in spring 2014.Barclays already operates similar technology to provide its Pingit money transfer service, which has registered 2.2m payments since launching in February 2012.Unlike some mobile payment services, Zapp is not seeking to cut out acquirers such as Visa and MasterCard.Instead, it hopes to use their connections with retailers to grow quickly and manage security risks, Mr Keenan explained.The way that the app works is likely to vary according to the way retailers choose to use it. Marks and Spencer, for example, uses contactless terminals, based on near-field communication.However, that technology has not always worked smoothly, with customers complaining they have been charged twice when more than one of their cards has entered the terminal’s range.
183;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;China blocks MasterCard processing renminbi transactions;;China has blocked MasterCard from processing credit card transactions in renminbi, raising concerns about Beijing’s willingness to fully open up the sector after the World Trade Organisation found that it unfairly restricted foreign card companies.According to a document obtained by the Financial Times, the Chinese central bank ordered last month that EPayLinks, an online payment platform, stop issuing renminbi-settled credit cards in partnership with MasterCard.The ruling by the People’s Bank of China comes less than a year after the WTO declared that Beijing discriminated against foreign electronic payment providers by allowing UnionPay – the Chinese rival to MasterCard and Visa – to monopolise domestic renminbi-denominated transactions.China has said that it would study the WTO judgment and state-owned media have reported that Beijing might announce new rules for its domestic card market as soon as next month.But in what industry executives say is a sign that China might continue to take a hard line, the central bank put its foot down on the initiative by EPayLinks to launch renminbi-settled cards supported by MasterCard, which was announced earlier this year.“No payment institution is allowed to co-operate with foreign card companies in developing cross-border payment businesses involving renminbi bank accounts or renminbi payment accounts,” the Chinese central bank ruled.“Foreign currencies must be used when clearing and settling domestic acquisitions made by people holding foreign credit cards.”China is among the world’s fastest-growing credit card markets, with 46m cards issued in the country last year. MasterCard has predicted that China will overtake the US as the largest market for cards by 2020, when it is expected to have about 900m.The explosion in card use has been lucrative for UnionPay, which was set up under the auspices of China’s central bank and is owned by 80 Chinese banks and other state entities. Its revenues more than tripled over the four years to 2011, reaching Rmb6bn ($978m), according to local media reports.All transactions at Chinese automated banking machines and merchants must be processed via UnionPay’s payments system. Visa and MasterCard are normally required to pay UnionPay a fee on transactions made using their cards in China.The MasterCard-branded cards issued by EPayLinks were “virtual”, giving customers the ability to buy products online in renminbi, with the deals settled by offshore renminbi processed through the MasterCard payments system.A representative of EPayLinks said that it had not violated China’s rules because it was not directly co-operating with MasterCard but rather conducting the business through its Hong Kong subsidiary. It added that it would strictly adhere to the central bank’s regulations in its business operations. MasterCard declined to comment.“Looking at ecommerce, it is clear that there will be a trend of foreign cards being used in China,” EPayLinks said. “The big trend is that this business will be permitted, but the exact policies are still not clear.”In its ruling, the Chinese central bank appeared to hold the door open to the possibility of foreign card companies eventually being given greater leeway in the domestic market. “We are now researching and drafting regulatory policies for foreign bank card organisations to enter the Chinese payment services market,” it said.Additional reporting by Emma Dong
184;V;Visa Inc;2013-05-30T20:12:44Z;Changing Mexico’s payment culture, one clip at a time;;If Adolfo Babatz has his way, his startup company, Clip, might just single-handedly revolutionised how Mexicans pay for goods and services.The idea is a simple one: transform smartphones into card reading terminals. But if successful, thousands if not millions of small mom-and-pop shops or even professionals in Mexico could soon be able to take payments from credit or debit cards for their products or services.Given the high rate of mobile phone penetration in Mexico – there are nearly 100m mobiles in this country of about 115m (of which 23.1m are smartphones) – a large number of store owners and professionals already have, in theory, a credit or debit card terminal in their hands.Like Square in the US, Clip has created a payment and credit card reader that plugs into the headphone jack of a smartphone. To use the device, the owners only need to register at Clip’s web page, download the company’s application and wait for the arrival in the mail of their card reader. Once plugged in, they can start accepting credit or debit cards in their establishments or offices, or even in the home or office of a client they are visiting.“We hope our system will revolutionise the day-to-day use of credit and debit cards”, said Babatz, who previously worked at PayPal, the online payment services company, during the launch of the device this week.Anyone who has been to Mexico would know that the country’s payment culture revolves around cash or check. Nearly 90 per cent of all business transactions in Mexico are carried with money or by writing a check, said Babatz.The low level of credit or debit transactions is due to the complexity of obtaining a reading terminal and the cost of using it in Mexico, he added. In fact, there are only 400,000 establishments in Mexico that have a reading terminal, out of about five million outlets.Unlike major credit card operators, Clip is offering its reading terminal free of charge and the only commission it takes is the 3.5 per cent fee on every transaction a client makes on his or her smartphone with the Clip application.“Clip only wins if its clients win”, said Babatz, who teamed up with Vilash Poovala, a former Visa executive, to create Clip, which is based in both Mexico City and San Francisco.One additional advantage of Clip, according to its executives, is that it does not discriminate against any cardholder in the country: credit and debit cards issued by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and even Discovery, which does not operate in Mexico, will be accepted.Clip did not give out any revenue projections. The only estimate the company gave was that it hopes to have 10,000 readers by the end of 2013.That seems to be good enough for investors. Clip has raised $1.2m so far and counts among its investors 500 Starups, Alta Ventures, Accion and technology entrepenuer, Karl Metha.
185;V;Visa Inc;2013-05-20T22:59:38Z;Partnerships: Global brands’ exploration of fresh territory ought not divert attention from home;Emerging markets and domestic relevance make for good strategy, says Johanna Kassel;The key for long-term success for both new and established brands is to stay relevant in home markets while aggressively expanding abroad, especially in developing economies, according to the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today.Tapping the consumer base in these emerging markets is key to brand expansion and behind some of the biggest risers in this year’s top 100, says Peter Walshe, global BrandZ director at Millward Brown Optimor, a strategic brand consultancy.“Most of the brands that are successful are encroaching into territories beyond their home markets,” says Mr Walshe. “Growth is very difficult if you are not in big growth markets.”Visa, the payment processor, ranked number nine with a 46 per cent brand value change, is focusing resources in emerging markets, especially Brazil, to “educate and motivate” consumers on electronic payments instead of cash.Sponsorship agreements at the upcoming World Cup and Olympics in Brazil will be key opportunities to expand Latin American and worldwide recognition of Visa, which can eventually lead to millions of new customers.Coca-Cola, which just celebrated its 127th birthday, is the longest running sponsor of the Olympics.Joseph Tripodi, Coca-Cola’s chief marketing and commercial officer, says these partnerships are “more than just slapping your logo on a sign or an ad. It is important to becoming a fully integrated partner with the owner creating enhanced value for the property.”More than 4bn people are estimated to watch the Olympics these days and most venues include some kind of Coke or Visa branding. Coca-Cola, ranked number five and with a 6 per cent brand value change, is particular about which events to sponsor. It chooses those that “stay true and authentic” to brand identity, which Mr Tripodi describes as focusing on the “uplifting, positivity and happiness”.Both Coca-Cola and Visa, which was founded in 1958, turned to social media for the first time in major global campaigns for London’s 2012 Olympics.Coca-Cola’s “Move to the beat” campaign incorporated tweets and a Facebook app through which users could access music, focusing on attracting younger customers.Visa took advantage of social media by connecting consumers with athletes through the “Go World” campaign, which resulted in 60m “cheers” and 48m views on YouTube. After the campaign, Visa said its brand equity grew at a significant level and propensity to use scores also increased.While expanding globally is vital to brand development, it is just as important to retain and develop customer base in companies’ established markets.Ranked sixth, AT&T, which added 10 per cent to its brand value, has the bulk of its 100m customers in the US, though it supports them as they travel abroad with network partnerships. To continue to expand its share in the crowded US mobile market, AT&T has focused on innovation and the personal connection to the customer. In the past decade, the telecoms company has moved from being a utility brand to a lifestyle brand. “In the last six years, since the launch of the iPhone, we actually had to catch our brand up to our company, the company that we have always been,” says Cathy Coughlin, AT&T’s chief marketing officer.This change in brand strategy means more focus on the customer as a person, including a new “don’t text and drive” campaign, to putting the customer in control of the products. AT&T had to adapt to demands for new technology as well.To stay relevant in home markets, Visa aims to “remain timeless” by connecting with customers with on-point marketing and new innovations. “We want to withstand the test of time, generation after generation, by becoming indispensable in consumers’ lives,” says Antonio Lucio, Visa’s chief brand officer.This presence in customers’ lives and loyalty, is one of the most important factors in retention. Staying relevant is the primary one, says Mr Walshe, because, although global marketing campaigns may be eye catching, local efforts are important.Coke is in 200 countries and has more than 1,000 manufacturing facilities with regional and local marketing teams. “It’s a matter of balancing the global and local. We’re a huge global brand, but we are producing locally, distributing locally and sourcing materials locally. We are getting an understanding of the experience at the ground level,” says Mr Tripodi.Coke’s highest per capita market is Mexico.“We don’t want to be the American brand in Mexico,” says Mr Tripodi. “We want to be the Mexican brand in Mexico.”——————————————-A correction has been made to this article.

186;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;Oakland objects to $7.25bn credit card price-fixing settlement;;The City of Oakland is objecting to the multibillion-dollar settlement of a price-fixing case against payment networks MasterCard and Visa over fees charged to merchants and retailers.The objection filed in the US District Court of Eastern New York challenges a $7.25bn settlement proposed last year by Visa, MasterCard and leading US banks with retailers over allegations of fee fixing for credit and debit cards.The case against Visa and MasterCard and the banks dates to 2005. The proposed settlement, one of the largest US antitrust accords, was made on behalf of about 7m merchants in the US, including cities such as Oakland and businesses such as Safeway.The settlement consists of a payment of more than $6bn for alleged past damages to retailers and a temporary reduction in the level of interchange fees paid by merchants on Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions.Barbara Parker, city attorney for Oakland, said the proposed accord offered only nominal financial damages to victims.“Oakland will still have to pay excessive fees to credit card companies when we should be able to use that money for essential programmes and services,” she said.Visa and MasterCard charge Oakland a so-called interchange fee every time the City accepts credit or debit cards for payments of parking tickets, business licence taxes and other fees. The city estimates that higher charges resulting from Visa’s and MasterCard’s practices cost taxpayers an estimated $103,000 a month.In another dispute, the Californian city last November said it planned to boycott Goldman Sachs after the investment bank refused to unwind a $16m interest rate swap struck more than a decade ago.At the time, city council members said that they hoped boycotting the bank would encourage other municipalities to put pressure on banks.Municipalities use swap deals to protect themselves from volatile interest rate movements. With interest rates at historic lows, these swap agreements may cost local governments $2.5bn a year, according to estimates by the Refund Transit Coalition from late 2012.
187;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Nigeria signs up MasterCard to make dual-purpose identity card;;MasterCard is teaming up with the Nigerian authorities to launch identity cards that will double up as electronic payment cards.The credit card provider said it was rolling out a pilot scheme that will initially target 13m people. The project ties in with the Nigerian government’s plans to introduce identity cards and reduce Nigerians’ reliance on cash transactions.The dual-purpose identity and payment card could initially be used for recipients of Nigerian state pensions. But it is hoped it could ultimately be broadened to include public sector salaries and other payments such as agricultural subsidies.Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and leading oil producer with 160m people and one of the continent’s fastest growing economies. But it has trailed Kenya, in east Africa, in introducing a mobile banking system.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria’s finance minister, said at the World Economic Forum in Cape Town that the initiative with MasterCard would help boost financial inclusion by bringing more people without bank accounts into the formal economy where the vast majority of transactions are still conducted in cash.She added that the government was working on implementing a number of “electronic platforms” which would help build institutions to “stop leakages” and fight corruption.“This programme is good practice for us to bring all the citizens on a common platform for interacting with the various government agencies and for transacting electronically,” she said.Mastercard’s rival, Visa has chosen a different entry strategy into Africa, initiating a pilot scheme in the tiny central African state of Rwanda, where in collaboration with the authorities it has enlisted about 100,000 users into a mobile telephone banking system similar to Kenya’s.MasterCard has launched a scheme comparable to its Nigerian venture in South Africa where it has issued some 10m cards for recipients of social grants, or welfare benefits.Michael Miebach, president of Middle East and Africa at MasterCard, said the number of electronic card terminals in Nigeria had swelled from about 8,000 to 160,000 over the past two years. Access Bank, a Nigerian bank, will be the initial partner issuing the cards.Like other multinationals, MasterCard has been drawn to Africa’s strong economic growth in recent years and the emergence in many countries of a new consumer class.Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s chief executive, said recently that the governments in Nigeria and Kenya were talking about moving towards becoming “cashless” societies.“The markets in Africa, the people you take as being remote, they are actually more advanced in their thinking around this issue than some of the more developed world, which tends to think let this be laisser-faire, it’ll happen on its own,” he said.
188;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Visa and MasterCard: fortunes diverge;Each provider enjoys secular trend away from cash;"Visa and MasterCard, the two largest payment processors, are often lumped together. But lately their fortunes have diverged. In the first three months of 2012, revenue at MasterCard grew by 8 per cent from the year before but missed Wall Street forecasts. Visa beat expectations with 15 per cent growth. MasterCard made cautious noises about the global economy; Visa sounded upbeat.In the US, Visa has been doing better than its smaller rival in credit. Its volumes jumped 9 per cent in the quarter, against only 2.4 per cent at MasterCard. Debit had been a tough area for Visa during the past few quarters, but now things may get easier. Dodd Frank rules that took effect last April ended exclusivity rights on debit transactions. All transactions on Visa-branded cards could before be processed only on Visa’s network. The new rules require debit cards to offer more network options, allowing MasterCard and others to grab some transactions. That had benefited the smaller MasterCard during the past year but now Visa faces easier comparisons.Another difference: MasterCard owns its European operations. whereas Visa Europe belongs to a group of banks. There have been rumblings that the banks may exercise a put option, requiring Visa to buy them out. The price tag is expected to be in the billions of dollars – but the benefits of bringing the European business in-house are likely to outweigh the cost. Visa has capacity on its balance sheet, too: it holds $4.3bn in cash and securities and has no debt.The great similarity between Visa and MasterCard – they are both enjoying the secular trend to card and digital payments and away from cash – is also the biggest reason to own shares of either. In the near-term, Visa appears to have a greater tailwind but the shares reflect that. Visa trades at 23 times forward earnings to MasterCard’s 21. Any more premium between the two and MasterCard starts to seem attractive, especially if the economy were to rebound in the second half.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

With a supplier demanding immediate payment, it risked having its assets seized to meet property tax bills, and looked unlikely to meet its next payroll.Yet the California-based Dashew Business Machines not only survived what he described as “the lowest point in my life”, but went on to bring the world one of the financial sector’s most enduringly successful innovations: embossed plastic cards.This near-oblivion followed by breakthrough became twin defining events for Dashew, who has died in Los Angeles aged 96. As recently as last year he was offering readers of the Huffington Post hints based on his 1950s experience about how to succeed during hard times.His autobiography, published in 2010 – You Can Do It! – refers regularly to innovators such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. He shared many of their traits – restlessly inventive, interested in a bewildering range of areas and overflowing with self-confidence. But according to co-author Josef Klus, Dashew was more inspired by his parents’ hard work and drive than any business role model.Stanley Aaron Dashew was born on September 16 1916 in Harlem, New York City, to Leon Dashew, the child of immigrants from eastern Europe, and Esther, born in Lithuania. His father, a lawyer, moved the family to the growing upstate town of Pomona, developed property there and bought the local bus company. His mother, a teacher, dissatisfied with standards, headed a reorganisation of the town’s schools.After three years of college, Dashew built a comfortable living as a salesman in various northeastern states for Addressograph-Multigraph, whose machines printed address labels. But his move to California in 1950 with his young family by his first wife Martha – he sailed his yacht from Chicago via the St Lawrence River and Panama Canal – changed his direction decisively. He set up there in competition with Addressograph to print cards and plates of information. The company was successful, according to the autobiography, because its machines worked faster than Addressograph’s.The 1954 cash flow crisis came as he sought to expand through providing data imprinting machines to the US military. He had to sell the yacht. Later in the year, with only $1,000 left, he supplied an air force base with an embossing machine that was still missing crucial, so far undelivered, components in order to speed up payment. The stress led to divorce from Martha.However, once the crisis had passed, Dashew began to explore how the military record-keeping technology might be applied to charge cards, which at the time were paper-based: easily torn or defaced. DBM’s printing and data-handling capabilities were well suited to the area. Addressograph, Dashew found, had discovered – but was not developing – an embossable plastic that could resolve those snags. “It was revealed to me that the answer to all my problems – well, this one at least – was ‘plastic’,” Dashew wrote in one of his Huffington Post columns.Bank of America was interested in the technology, a company salesman discovered. In 1958 the bank gave him an initial order for a machine to imprint what would become the Visa card. It would later place vast orders for DBM’s embossing equipment.The company’s expansion gave Dashew room to express the salesmanship skills he had been honing since childhood. For a presentation to American Express, he had made cards for each executive, complete with the phrase “member since . . . ” that still appears on each.While his breakthrough was transforming consumer culture, Dashew himself was involved mainly in areas away from the credit card industry. DBM’s sale in 1962 to an arm of Howard Hughes Corporation proved to be disastrous and ended in bankruptcy for his creation.Dashew developed technologies including an offshore mooring system for oil tankers and a means to carry material around mines.With his second wife, Rita, whom he married in 1958 and who died in 1994 (he is survived by a son and a daughter), Dashew funded a centre for overseas students at UCLA. Albert Carnesale, a former chancellor of the university who knew him well, cites his effort to ensure US and foreign students mixed at the centre as an example of Dashew’s awareness of immigrants’ needs.Still, he remained a constant inventor. In 2006, suffering from Parkinson’s disease and compression of the spine, he devised a walking aid called the Dashaway, which he said greatly alleviated the symptoms.According to Mr Klus, Dashew showed little patience for the intricacies of building prototypes, gaining safety certificates and testing materials. Instead, he was above all eager to market the Dashaway, with the same flair he had shown a half-century before at American Express.

The issues raised mirror parts of a parallel commission investigation into Visa.Alongside the commission’s actions, MasterCard and Visa are under investigation or facing court proceedings in eight EU countries. Brussels is also preparing a legislative proposal, to be published this summer, which could effectively cut fee levels, require more transparency or open access to rival payments groups.So far the competition cases largely revolve around “interchange fees” on cross-border card payments, which a consumer’s bank levies on a merchant’s bank for retail sales transactions. However, the push for reform could soon move to relatively untouched domestic card fees.MasterCard said it intended to “fully co-operate with the commission”. It added: “As a global electronic payments company MasterCard always aims to balance the interests of both consumers and retailers to ensure that each party pays its fair share of the costs for the benefits it receives.”The commission’s concerns relate to the relatively higher fees that retailers typically face when handling payments from customers – such as American tourists – from outside the EU.This issue was not touched by the commission’s 2007 decision against MasterCard, which applied to cross-border fees paid within the EU. After the ruling, MasterCard significantly cut its interchange fee rate on an “interim” basis, without accepting wrongdoing.In a landmark ruling from the EU’s second-highest court, MasterCard lost its appeal, which had become a test of the fundamental principles of how competition law is applied to the card market.Most consumers are unaware of the charges, which provide multibillion-euro revenue streams for card-issuing banks. MasterCard sees the charges as vital to a cheap and secure service with benefits such as insurance and loyalty rewards.The latest commission investigation will also look at other restrictions faced by retailers, including the requirement to “honour all cards” even when premium MasterCards – such as “gold” cards – carry higher fees.Brussels is also concerned about rules on “cross-border acquiring” within the MasterCard system that potentially stop retailers from benefiting from lower card fee rates in other EU countries. Charges on a €50 transaction can range from 10 cents in the Netherlands to 80 cents in Poland.
192;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
193;V;Visa Inc;2013-03-27T13:21:29Z;PayPal’s ‘free ride’ on payments to end;;PayPal faces a turf war with traditional credit card companies as the race to establish a widely used digital wallet heats up and friendly partnerships take on a more competitive edge.At PayPal parent eBay’s analyst day on Thursday, analysts are likely to seek more details about fees MasterCard, and possibly Visa, plan to charge the online payment company for using their networks to process mobile payments in physical stores.“PayPal rides for free on the back of other business models,” said Chris McWilton, MasterCard’s president of US Markets at a conference this month. “I think they’ve got to be cautious that they don’t get too big and start making people wake up and say wait a minute, I’m actually losing business here because of your moving into the physical space.”Ebay’s stock has fallen slightly in recent weeks over concerns about the fees, hitting a low of $50.11, after rallying steadily for the whole of last year.PayPal formed several partnerships with physical retailers last year, including Home Depot and Toys R Us, who agreed to accept PayPal digital wallet payments at their in-store registers – shoppers wave their phones over the register and the purchase amount is deducted from their PayPal account. In a January earnings call, John Donahoe, chief executive of eBay, said the company would focus this year on consumer outreach.Several other companies have been pushing to build their own digital wallet for consumers, and offer in-store point of sale systems for merchants to accept such payments. Google, Intuit and Square, a San Francisco start-up, have all been racing with PayPal to become the go-to product.Four out of five large and national retailers indicated mobility as a top store system priority in 2013, with about 50 per cent planning to install some form of tablet or handheld system for sales associates by the end of the year, according to Barclay’s research.Now that the technology is gaining traction, MasterCard said in a February regulatory filing that it would start to charge PayPal, and other digital wallet operators, a fee for using its networks.Last week, Charlie Scharf, chief executive of Visa, suggested his company might follow suit.“Some of the people we compete with started out as one thing and they morph into another thing,” he said at the Barclay’s Emerging Payments Forum. “And if they changed enough that we think it warrants us to change something with us, we will do that.”Analysts are hoping PayPal will reveal at its analyst meeting more details about the size of the new fee MasterCard is charging and indicate how margins will be impacted by such fees, especially if other credit card companies implement them.Analysts at Nowak Equity Research predict such fees will have minimal impact on eBay’s overall earnings per share, just about 1 per cent in 2014.“The runway for growth in payments is long,” they said in a report. “Competition is likely to remain fierce, but we believe there’s room for PayPal to serve as the fifth network.”
194;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:06:37+0000;Myanmar: credit card market hots up;;"In Myanmar, southeast Asia’s latest golden investment opportunity, being in first wins headlines for foreign companies, as Coca-Cola and Standard Chartered have recently shown.But as payment networks MasterCard and Visa have discovered, it doesn’t guarantee a lead over the competition.For the growing number of repeat visitors to Myanmar, including business people, foreign government officials and aid workers, the tedium of carrying massive wads of cash is the price of doing business in Myanmar. Not only that, but under unspoken rules observed by nearly all hotels, shops and businesses, the cash must be pristine US dollars.Running out of dollars always used to mean getting stranded, but since the government allowed the entry of foreign credit card issuers in November, the economy, at least for visitors, has opened, albeit tentatively, to card transactions and ATM machines. With the next step – enabling credit card issuance – just around the corner, the market for credit and debit cards has already become highly competitive.MasterCard, the number two payments network in the US, was the first to notch up an ATM transaction in Myanmar last November and since then has dispensed over $1.7m to foreigners, according to local media. As it completed its first ceremonial card payment at an airline on March 4, the company announced that it would increase the number of ATMs available to foreign card holders. By the end of 2013, it promises to enable card payments at over 500 restaurants, hotels and shops in four cities.But while MasterCard was early into Myanmar, it is no longer alone – or even ahead.China UnionPay, a 10-year-old credit and debit card group set up by China’s government, is now bigger globally than Visa and MasterCard by number of cards issued – 2.9bn by the end of 2011, 45 per cent of the world’s total. The company began offering payment services to foreigners in Myanmar in February, and already allows its cardholders to access 198 ATMs and 465 point-of-sale terminals.While MasterCard has arranged deals with individual banks to provide access to ATMs, CUP has negotiated a similar deal with the Myanmar Payment Union, an organisation of 17 local member banks which opened in September 2011. Myanmar is just the latest battle ground between the global card issuers.In Myanmar, Visa has taken a similar tack to MasterCard, signing its first licensing agreements with three banks in November and performing country’s first ever international card transaction in January, while competitor Japanese Credit Bureau also negotiated contracts with MPU member banks to supply branded credit cards to customers. Visa is shortly expected to announce several more partnerships with Myanmar banks which will expand its network to allow customers to use their cards in more places.To date, deals between local banks and card companies have mainly focused on visiting foreigners. Card companies are waiting on permission to issue credit cards in the country, and say it could be a matter of weeks. While Myanmar citizens are entitled to open bank accounts, the take-up has been low, partly due to deep-seated mistrust of banks following bank scandals and collapses in the early 2000s and the continuing lack of deposit insurance.Efforts by local banks to win back customers received a setback earlier this year amid rumours – eventually proven unfounded – that the chairman of Kanbawza Bank, one of the country’s largest banks, had been arrested. The damage was done by early reports, resulting in a run on the bank that led to the withdrawal of $10.5m in October last year.Despite these difficulties, private domestic banks have begun offering letters of credit to businesses and international banks have begun moving in. As Myanmar welcomes record numbers of visitors – over 1m in 2012 – and more foreign companies and hotels set up, the competition among payment networks will only intensify. But credit card companies know that their future in the domestic market also depends on the revival of consumer confidence in the banks – something which takes years to build and days to destroy.Related reading:

195;V;Visa Inc;2013-03-14T00:11:45Z;Intuit launches mobile payments app;;Intuit, the maker of the QuickBooks accounting software, became the latest vendor to enter the UK mobile payments market on Wednesday with a mobile app and device that can take chip and pin payments.The product, called Intuit Pay, joins services from iZettle and Payleven, and will get the jump on PayPal’s new service, PayPal Here, which was announced last month but will not be available until summer.Like PayPal and iZettle, Intuit is offering the service on a pay-per-transaction basis, charging no subscription fee but taking 2.75 per cent commission on each transaction.Intuit’s launch highlights growing competition in the market for mobile payments in the UK as companies target small merchants who cannot afford the fees and commitment of more established services from banks.“Current solutions are either too expensive, demand long-term contracts or simply don’t work where businesses need them,” said Terry Hicks, vice-president of products for Intuit.As with PayPal Here, vendors can apply for the service from within the mobile app, but Intuit is taking the extra step of offering the card reader free for a limited time. iZettle’s chip and pin device costs £49 at present and PayPal has yet to announce pricing for its reader, which it said would be “competitive”.Intuit says its selling point is tight integration with its cloud accounting software, QuickBooks Online, which is popular among small businesses. In the US, the company says it already processes $37bn of payments each year through its desktop and mobile services.At the Mobile World Congress trade show last month MasterCard and Visa both announced new electronic payment systems that include a mobile element, though both companies also support payment through services such as iZettle.But chip and pin system for card payments has remained a barrier to entry for foreign start-ups such as Square, the US mobile payments company that claims to be processing $8bn in payments a year.IZettle, which launched in the UK in November with card and signature services, last month added chip and pin technology through a partnership with Banco Santander.Responding to news of the Intuit launch, Stewart Roberts, iZettle managing director, said breaking into the market would require more than just a chip and pin device.“This business is not about hardware. What makes a difference for users, and what differentiates iZettle from the competition, is we offer an easy, user friendly and secure service overall.”
196;V;Visa Inc;2013-03-11T19:46:32Z;Argentina: pros & cons of ‘supercard’;;Is “no gracias” to Visa and Mastercard on the cards in Argentina?The possibility of supermarkets only accepting a new supermarket credit card (valid for use in all big chains, the thousands of Chinese-run neighbourhood stores, some electronic and white goods retailers and even petrol stations at YPF, the state oil company) sparked a slew of headlines over the weekend in Argentina.The idea came up last Friday at a meeting with Guillermo Moreno , the internal trade minister.Since 2002, when Argentina began picking up the pieces after its default on nearly $100bn, banks have been falling over themselves to attract customers. As a result, the price of a shirt, for example, may vary depending on which bank card you buy it with and what promotion – say, 15 per cent off on a Tuesday with one bank or 20 per cent with another on a Wednesday. Argentines, used – nay , officially encouraged – to shopping around because of inflation, often have more than one card and are adept at taking advantage of the promotions.Indeed, such promotions-based shopping has become so ingrained that even the ultra upmarket Patio Bullrich shopping precinct in Buenos Aires, which had turned its nose up at such discount offers, finally had to cave in and accept them.Now, according to whether the newspaper you read is rabidly pro- or anti-government, the supermarket card idea was either the initiative of the supermarkets themselves or the government, and may or may not be exclusive. If it were, it would be adios to the use of Visa and Mastercard by supermarket shoppers in a country where, ironically, the government has been trying to get people to use bank cards more.The idea appeals to supermarkets and the government for different reasons. Supermarkets are fed up with banks, which make big profits, charging them 3 per cent commission on credit cards.They would welcome it if what the press has already dubbed the “supercard” or “Morenocard” could slash that to 1 per cent. Mind you, some in the sector don’t like the sound of making any such card exclusive – i.e. stopping stores from accepting other payment methods once they adopt the card, for fear of upsetting customers.For the government, on the other hand, a card potentially even administered by the state-run Banco de la Nación would give it regular and in-depth information about prices. That could be handy since inflation is running at about 26 per cent , and the government is widely believed to want to extend a price-freeze it talked supermarkets into accepting.At the same time, the low-commission card could provide a handy stick with which to beat the banks which are flush with cash. (It’s an election year, remember – mid-terms are due in October). That could well be the real point here.

Your motor is everything: it has to be either fast and expensive or as big as a tank.Taking that into account, First Gulf Bank – an Abu Dhabi bank – has launched the first Ferrari credit card alongside Visa to be offered in the Middle East and Africa.If platinum is not enough, flashing a Ferrari credit card is likely to attract some kind of attention, from predatory gold diggers if no-one else.A quick peek at the Ferrari fan website shows that the card is already available in Russia, Hungary, Switzerland and Hong Kong, with Saudi Arabia and Japan coming soon.Signature cardholders get an opportunity to win race driving sessions, visits to the Ferrari factory in Italy and deals for the online shop. But Infinite card holders double their chances to win as getting offers on hotels, Harrod’s Black Tier membership, free insurance up to $1m and two-for-one cinema tickets.My personal favorite however, is that if you spend 10,000Dh ($2,722) you get… wait for it…. a free Ferrari cap.The emirate’s love affair with the Italian car brand runs deep. Abu Dhabi has already built a theme park dedicated to Ferrari.Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi government investment arm, even held a stake in Ferrari itself before selling it back to Italy’s Fiat in 2010 after five years.Marcello Baricordi, General Manager for Visa UAE, said in a statement:When First Gulf Bank approached us with their idea to create a credit card especially aimed at Ferrari fans we were enthusiastic to be part of an innovative new product, which taps into consumer brand affiliations across a wide geographic region. Ferrari Credit Card holders will have the added advantage of the connectivity and security which Visa gives them, allowing them to indulge their passion safely no matter where they are in the world.Baricordi highlights an important point – safety. The UAE’s roads are amongst the most dangerous in the world and many people drive like maniacs.Whether it’s driving with headlights on full beam in the middle of the day to warn others to get out the way, or snaking through lanes at top speeds, Gulf drivers take extreme risks. UAE residents take a deep breath before running the gauntlet that is the road from Abu Dhabi to Dubai and back.A 2009 United Nations report published in Abu Dhabi’s The National newspaper showed that people are seven times more likely to die in a road accident in the UAE than in the UK. More recent statistics show that around 2 people a day die in road accidents in the country.That Ferrari is a strong luxury brand in the Gulf is beyond debate but whether it’s the image a bank should be promoting in a credit card is a different question.If people living in the UAE learnt anything from the financial crisis it’s that borrowing money for fast cars isn’t a great idea. Like those of 2009, they may just end up abandoning them at the airport.Related reading

198;V;Visa Inc;2013-02-26T16:41:24Z;Visa and Samsung in mobile payments deal;;Visa and Samsung have announced an agreement designed to make it easier for smartphone users to use their devices to make mobile payments, and accelerate the adoption of NFC ‘tap-and-pay’ technology.NFC (near field communications) technology and mobile payments have emerged as one the key themes of the Mobile World Congress taking place in Barcelona, Spain this week.Earlier this week MasterCard launched MasterPass, an enhanced version of its mobile wallet PayPass, but the Visa Samsung global alliance is a first of its kind between a leading NFC handset manufacturer and payment network, paving the way for the implementation of large scale mobile payment programs.Smartphone makers and mobile operators believe that NFC technology could help spur adoption of smartphones by consumers and help consolidate the network operators’ position at the centre the emerging mobile e-commerce market.However, even though many new smartphones, including Samsung’s popular Galaxy family of devices, have NFC chips built into them, the technology has been slow to take off in most markets because of consumer confusion and the lack of a co-ordinated strategy involving handset makers, mobile network operators and financial institutions.Under the terms of the agreement announced in Barcelona, Samsung will preload Visa’s pay Wave application on to its NFC-enabled handsets. That will make it much easier for consumers and financial institutions to link their new handsets to their bank accounts.“The key to making mobile payments broadly available all over the world is to offer financial institutions a secure way to provision millions of smartphones with payment account information” said Jim McCarthy, global head of product, Visa.Won-Pyo Hong, head of Samsung’s Media Solution Center, added: “The partnership with Visa represents a step towards a global mobile payment platform. We believe that we have a strong value proposition for financial institutions that will ultimately allow consumer choice in NFC payments.”Visa claims that contactless payments have quadrupled over last year and now generate around 13m transactions per month, while ABI Research forecasts that a total of 1.95 billion NFC-enabled devices will ship in 2017.“This is a significant agreement that could give NFC a much-needed boost, given that Visa is a trusted payment brand, while Samsung is the top smartphone manufacturer in terms of shipments and a driving force behind the increasingly popular Android device platform,” said Eden Zoller, consumer analyst, at Ovum, the telecoms research firm.“Both Samsung and Visa are committed to NFC and we would expect them to put effort and marketing muscle behind making consumers aware of the potential benefits that NFC payments can bring. This is desperately needed as for most consumers, mobile payments – let alone NFC – are simply not on their radar.”
199;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;MasterCard moves into mobile payments;;MasterCard unveiled its long-awaited foray into the mobile payments market at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday.MasterPass, which will incorporate both a digital wallet for consumers and a mobile-friendly checkout for merchants online and in-store, signals a break from the US-based credit card company’s traditional branding.Although MasterCard has offered online payment services for years, these have revolved around its credit cards, with users having to fill out card numbers, expiry dates and security codes – a process most consumers are reluctant to carry out on their phones.Jorn Lambert of MasterCard Worldwide said the service would be available to consumers through financial institutions in Australia and Canada by the end of March, and in the US and UK in spring and summer respectively.“We are working with our partners to make sure everything hits at the same time. We don’t want people to register for wallets before they can actually use it,” he said.Launch partners will include UK high-street retailers Argos and Boots, and American Airlines in the US. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Citi, Swedbank, UniCredit and Westpac have all signed up to support the service.Mobile payments are a hot topic at the Mobile World Congress this year. Although the number of retail apps has exploded, revenues have yet to match the hype. Most retailers build their own payment systems, forcing consumers to register and enter their payment details separately.MasterPass includes a digital wallet – in effect an app – that allows consumers to keep all their payment and loyalty card details as well as shipping addresses on their phone. MasterCard says this will accept cards and payment systems from competitors.The second, more crucial, element of MasterPass is digital checkout services for merchants. This will appear online as a MasterPass payment option – much like Visa, MasterCard and PayPal do now – or as a barcode-like QR code on items in stores, which customers can scan and pay for instantly.Mr Lambert said the strength of the new platform was that it could incorporate services such as loyalty discounts, based on location or purchase history.“The great thing about the phone is it’s an interactive device – let’s make sure we take full advantage of that and not just do what a plastic card can do. If a retailer wants to offer discounts or loyalty points as part of the transaction, that can happen.”The company says it expects all vendors who accept MasterCard to adopt the new system within two years.“There is no website today that doesn’t accept MasterCard and there will be no website that does not accept MasterPass in a while,” Mr Lambert said.MasterCard faces plenty of competition in mobile payments, with Visa expected to make further announcements about V.me, its upcoming digital wallet service, this week.In the UK last week, PayPal launched a cheap card-payment product for mobile merchants that will increase its presence, and other services such as Square in the US and iZettle in Europe are also targeting the sector. Google and Apple have both launched digital wallet products.Mobile payments have also been seen as a source of revenues for mobile operators, whose returns have so far failed to match the huge investments in infrastructure required to service the mobile internet.Mr Lambert said that although he welcomed moves by competitors – some of whom already accept MasterCard through their systems – merchants were unlikely to support many platforms.“In the physical world you can have three [payment systems] max,” he said. “Online you will have a few more, but I see a convergence towards a few brands that offer interoperability. You cannot have a website where you have MasterPass, V.me, Google Wallet, iTunes and several others.”
200;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Monitise gains as people shift to mobile;;Monitise, the mobile payments company, has said it is benefiting from surging demand for payments on smartphones, with the number of transactions that it has processed quadrupling year on year.In 2012, the total number of transactions via Monitise’s software rose to almost 2bn, from 500m the previous year, as customers adapted quickly to the idea of paying for goods on their smartphones and tablets.Alastair Lukies, chief executive, said: “There is a quickening shift to mobile. People are now more comfortable on mobile – the device itself is not any barrier to spending patterns.”Monitise – which provides mobile payments for Visa and many UK high street banks – processed payments worth $31bn at an annualised rate, more than treble the figure for last year.“It is a massive number for us,” said Mr Lukies. “When you compare to Visa, who did trillions, we’re still at the foothills of the opportunity.”Revenues at the group rose 62.6 per cent to £27.8m for the six months to the end of December. Monitise said it expects full-year revenues of about £70m.However, losses increased due largely to costs taken on through last year’s acquisition of Clairmail – a rival mobile payments company – for $173m in an all-share deal. Clairmail, since renamed Monitise Americas, has nearly 10m customers across North America. The group swung to a pre-tax loss of £24.4m, from a £1.1 pre-tax profit in the same period last year as a result.Gross margin improved to 72 per cent, up 3 percentage points from the previous half.Monitise also announced a new venture with BlackBerry in Indonesia, where the Canadian handset maker has approximately half of the mobile market. Monitise will operate a payment service using BlackBerry Messenger – the popular service that lets users send free messages to one another. Mr Lukies said Monitise had similar deals in the pipeline, although not exclusively with BlackBerry.Monitise raised £94.8m late last year, to fund its efforts to gain more market share. “If you’re turning up to this market now, you’re way too late,” claimed Mr Lukies. “We’ve been doing this for years.”“There is a lot of generic interest in the space,” he added. “People are trying to unpick the complexity of mobile money. Whatever people think it is, we’re the market leader.”In total, Monitise has 20m customers – more than treble the number it had at this time last year. The group has benefited from its close links with Visa and Visa Europe, which own stakes of 7 per cent and 7.5 per cent in Monitise respectively.Overall, though, Monitise posted a diluted loss per share of 2.2p, compared with a 0.1p gain the previous year.Shares in the Aim-traded company rose 1.5 per cent on Monday to 34.5p.
201;V;Visa Inc;2013-02-10T17:01:00Z;Visa / MasterCard: cashed out;Driver of the gains has been move towards cashless society;When stockpickers dream, they dream of charts like those of Visa or MasterCard. The payment processors’ stocks have more than doubled since the start of 2011, in a beautiful steady climb. Sure, the shares were depressed back in 2010 – spending was weak in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and there was uncertainty about the part of Dodd Frank regulation that capped swipe fees on debit transactions. Spending has returned and the regulations have proven to be manageable, but the driver of the gains has been the move towards a cashless society.According to The Nilson Report, half of consumer payments in the US were done with cards in 2011, up from about 40 per cent in 2006. By 2016, over 60 per cent of payments are expected to be made with cards versus half that with cash, cheques, money orders and the like.But the thing about secular trends is that they eventually mature. This one still has room left, but most of the growth will come from outside the US, particularly in emerging markets. MasterCard estimates that 85 per cent of the world’s transactions are still done with paper. Both Visa and MasterCard are growing their presence in the developing world. And these companies will also prosper as global spending rises generally.There are threats. For a start regulators could crack down further on fees. And there is the risk of disintermediation, particularly in mobile payments. In the next phase of the shift away from cash – the move from paying with a piece of plastic to a phone – new entrants could try to change payment processing to capture, or in the case of merchants avoid, some of the fees.The incumbents have a key defence: banks, companies and consumers trust of their networks. That helps explain why both companies trade at multiples of more than 20 times this year’s earnings. At that level, the secular trend alone is not enough to ensure further outperformance. The economy has to co-operate, too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
202;V;Visa Inc;2013-02-04T21:14:11Z;Visa probed over currency conversions;;Australia’s competition watchdog launched a case against Visa, alleging the company abused its market power by preventing customers from using a currency of their choice when shopping.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will ask a federal court to rule on allegations that the world’s largest payment network is actively limiting consumer choice by preventing retail stores in Australia from offering so-called dynamic currency conversion services if they did not have the system in place before May 2010.In addition, Visa is also alleged to have banned other businesses from offering the service at automatic teller machines from October 2007 if cardholders withdraw cash using Visa cards.“The ACCC is concerned that Visa sought to stop the growth of competing dynamic currency conversion (DCC) services and, as a result, limit the choices available to consumers,” said ACCC chairman Rod Sims.Unlike DCC, if a cardholder uses Visa’s own currency service the exchange rate is not disclosed by Visa at the time of purchase and is often set higher than the floating currency rate used by DCC.Visa earns less when a cardholder chooses to use DCC than when they use Visa’s own currency conversion services, the regulator said in a statement on Monday.“Travellers to Australia using a Visa payment card do not get to choose who does their currency conversion when withdrawing cash from an ATM. In particular, they are denied the ability to know the cost of transactions in their own currency at the time the transaction is made,” Mr Sims said.Visa said it would “vigorously defend itself against claims by the ACCC that our rules on dynamic currency conversion infringe Australia’s competition laws.”It confirmed it does not allow currency conversion at automatic tellers, but it said it does permit it at merchant stores, according to a company statement.The parties are due in court in Sydney on March 14 for an initial directions hearing.Last year, Visa was part of a $6bn settlement in the US alongside MasterCard after a seven-year battle with US retailers. The US merchants had accused the payment networks of fixing the price of fees retailers must pay every time consumers use cards for purchases.
203;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Debit cards drive Visa Europe growth;;Visa Europe reported record revenue last year as consumers continued to favour debit cards to make purchases while the payments business ramps up a push into mobile transactions.The group, the independently owned European arm of Visa, generated €1.1bn in revenue in the twelve months to September 30, an increase of 10.8 per cent from €1bn a year earlier.“The biggest driver of growth in the past few years has been debit,” Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe, told the Financial Times on Monday.For the first time spending on Visa debit cards across Europe exceeded €1tn, an increase of 8.8 per cent compared with the same period the previous year. The payments technology company, which develops the infrastructure needed to process payments, said spending on debit cards in the UK rose 7.1 per cent to £360bn.The increase was driven by consumers turning to debit cards to pay for lower value items as well as a rise in the number of purchases made online.“Europe tends to be primarily a debit territory,” said Mr Ayliffe, who attributed the rise in debit use to consumers seeking alternatives as the use of cheques declines and to a greater aversion to pay using credit.The busiest period last year across Europe was on December 21, when in one hour spending peaked at €305m across 5m transactions.“There’s not a day when trading does not take place,” Mr Ayliffe said, adding that on Christmas day in the UK 2.6m transactions amounting to £76m took place.The group is owned by about 3,000 banks and other payment providers and re-invests part of its pre-tax profits to develop payment technologies. It estimates that by 2020 half of payment transactions will be made through a mobile device.The group said it would invest €500m to develop the infrastructure for mobile payments systems.On Monday it launched a new “digital wallet” service, which will allow customers to register and store details of their debit and credit cards in one place and access this from any mobile device. The service, first made available to Royal Bank of Scotland customers this week, is expected to be introduced across the UK to account-holders with other high street banks in the coming months.
204;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;Monitise aims to raise £100m in placings;;Monitise, which provides mobile payments for Visa and many UK high street banks, will raise up to £100m in two share placings as the group attempts to beef up its mobile commerce arm.The placings were announced as Monitise agreed to take full control of Mobile Money Network, the mobile ecommerce service in which it had a 50 per cent stake, for £15m in an all-share deal.Monitise announced a fully underwritten placing worth £34.2m gross, with shares priced at a 10 per cent discount to Monday’s close at 30p.Monitise also announced plans, subject to shareholder approval, to raise a further £65.8m gross at 30p per share. Canaccord is the sole bookrunner for both placings.Duncan McIntyre, chairman, said: “The proceeds from our placing will be used to rapidly scale our business as we enhance our mobile commerce capabilities.”Sales at Monitise are forecast to come in at more than $110m for the full year. The group has benefited from a surge in user numbers on its mobile platform, which now has 18m customers against just 5.5m at the end of last year. Monitise now processes $25bn of payments annually, compared with $1bn a year ago.Monitise said last week it was considering becoming the latest company to leave Aim and join the London Stock Exchange’s main market in 2013, despite speculation that the group would seek a Nasdaq listing.Shares in the group closed up 3.9 per cent at 33p before the statement was made.
205;V;Visa Inc;2012-11-01T21:28:15Z;Industrials lead Wall Street higher;;Industrial companies led Wall Street higher on Thursday as positive manufacturing data and fresh stimulus measures from China helped to boost US equities.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 1,427.59 as investors looked to put the weather-related shutdown of the US market on Monday and Tuesday behind them.The S&P 500 industrials index advanced 1.8 per cent to put it among the top rising sector groups in the week’s second trading session. Investors welcomed a survey of US manufacturing activity that showed production in the sector increased in October at a faster pace than expected.That report from the Institute for Supply Management came after the day started with news that China’s central bank pumped $60bn into the world’s second-largest economy this week to support infrastructure investments. Meanwhile, manufacturing data out of China also suggested reason for investor optimism after an important survey said activity in October rose to a four-month high.Masco Corp, the maker of home improvement and building products, rose 6.9 per cent to $16.13. Cummins, the diesel engine manufacturer, moved 5.5 per cent to $98.75 and Joy Global, the maker of mining equipment, gained 5.7 per cent to $66.03.“Broadening manufacturing is one of the pillars of economic growth, along with advancing corporate confidence, which still remains a head wind,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “But the market’s attention right now is on the strong US manufacturing number, which bodes well for the next quarter of corporate earnings.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 1 per cent higher to 13,232.62. Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, rose 3.4 per cent to $87.65.US equities were also bolstered by two pieces of labour market data, ahead of Friday’s important non-farm payrolls report. The labour department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to 363,000, ahead of market forecasts. Meanwhile, private sector payroll processor ADP said 158,00 jobs were created in October, up from 88,000 a month earlier.Mr Cote said: “The focus is now squarely on Friday’s jobs report, which has serious implications on the course of the upcoming presidential election.”LinkedIn shares closed 0.1 per cent lower to $106.85, but it was set to open higher after rising more than 5.7 per cent in after-market trading. The business networking site reported third-quarter results ahead of the analyst forecasts.Starbucks, the coffee chain, finished 1.6 per cent higher to $46.62. The company was also set to open higher on Friday as it reported robust earnings and was up more than 6 per cent in after-market trading.Troy Alstead, Starbucks chief financial officer, said the storm would not have a meaningful impact on its results for the current quarter, noting that most of its stores had reopened and some had become sources of power and sustenance for people affected.The upbeat sentiment among investors on Thursday also helped to lower Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the CBOE Vix index. The measure of implied volatility on S&P 500 options contracts has climbed as US equities have retreated since touching their highest point of the year in September. But the Vix was 10.3 per cent lower to 16.7 on Thursday.CBOE Holdings gained 4 per cent to $30.66 as the US derivatives exchange operator said trading volumes in Vix futures reached record levels in October.Technology sector stocks on the S&P 500 rose 1.8 per cent as chipmaker and micro communications companies saw gains. JDS Uniphase Corp, the fibre optics manufacturer, climbed 8 per cent to $10.48. Micron Technology, the semiconductor maker, rose 6.6 per cent to $5.78. Intel Corp, the chipmaker, moved 2.9 per cent higher to $22.26.The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.4 per cent to 3,020.06. Shares in Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, gained 0.2 per cent to $596.54.Visa, the global payments company, moved 3.7 per cent higher to $143.88 after it reported a day earlier that net income almost doubled in its latest quarter. Rival MasterCard also reported robust results on Wednesday and advanced 1.7 per cent to $468.69 as US consumer spending boosted both card groups.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was among the top rising sectors and advanced 1.3 per cent. Fresh consumer and retail data showed that same store sales in October rose 2.7 per cent in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.Abercrombie & Fitch, the retailer that targets teenage consumers, was 8.7 per cent higher to $33.23. Fossil, the watchmaker and leather goods retailer, gained 7.8 per cent to $93.88.
206;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:12:32+0000;US consumer spending boosts card groups;Net income rises on international growth;Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payments networks, reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates on the back of a rise in US consumer spending.California-based Visa said fiscal fourth-quarter net income rose 89 per cent to $1.66bn, or $2.47 a share, from $880m, or $1.27 a year earlier. Profit per share, excluding one-time items, was $1.54, higher than the $1.50 estimate in a Bloomberg survey.MasterCard’s results were also upbeat, with third-quarter net income climbing 7.7 per cent to $772m, or $6.17 a share, up from $717m, or $5.63, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast earnings per share of $5.92.Both companies benefited from a 0.8 per cent rise in consumer spending in the US in September, which helped offset declines in global growth and concerns about the so-called fiscal cliff. Spending by US consumers accounts for more than half of Visa’s revenue and 40 per cent for MasterCard.Wednesday’s report will be Visa’s last before chief executive Joseph Saunders retires. Earlier this month, Visa named Charles Scharf, the former head of retail banking at JPMorgan Chase, as Mr Saunders’ successor.For the fiscal full-year, Visa’s service revenues were $4.9bn, up 14 per cent over the prior year as international transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border volume, grew 13 per cent to $3bn.Mr Saunders attributed Visa’s results to its focus on its core business and expansion outside of the US.Activity also picked up worldwide, with spending on MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards, adjusted for currency fluctuations, climbing 12 per cent to $676bn. Processed transactions rose 24 per cent to 8.7bn.“MasterCard continues to drive solid financial performance and focus on executing key deals, investments and partnerships,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive.“ Emerging geographies and governments continue to provide great opportunities for growth,” he said.The company continued with a stock buyback programme, spending $216m to buy 500,000 shares during the quarter. MasterCard also bought back an additional 255,000 shares this month for $119m and still has $1.1bn left to spend under a $1.5bn repurchase programme.For the nine months ended September 30, MasterCard reported net income of $2.2bn, or $17.18 per diluted share, excluding a special item taken in the second quarter.MasterCard and Visa this year put an end to a lengthy legal battle with US retailers by agreeing to a settlement of at least $6bn. The US merchants had accused the payment networks of fixing the level of fees retailers must pay every time consumers use cards for purchases.MasterCard has said its share of the settlement would cost $790m, while that of Visa was about $4.4bn.MasterCard’s shares have risen 22 per cent this year and Visa has gained 37 per cent, outpacing gains in the S&P 500 and a 13 per cent rise for the S&P 500 information technology group, which tracks the performance of 70 companies.MasterCard shares rose 0.7 per cent to $456 after the report and Visa traded 1.5 per cent higher to $140.85 in extended trading hours.
207;V;Visa Inc;2012-10-31T20:38:58Z;Wall Street trades flat post-shutdown;;US equity markets closed fractionally higher after trading in negative territory most of the day, following a two-day closure, and recorded their first monthly decline since May.The main US markets were shut on Monday and Tuesday after flooding of the New York financial district following hurricane Sandy, which prevented thousands of workers from reaching their offices when transit along the east coast was crippled.The reopening came as a relief to investors as most portfolio managers tried to reduce their exposure to stocks before key US jobs data on Friday and the presidential election next week.Scott Wren, senior equities strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said: “Traders do not want to have big positions going into the election so we will probably see more of the same down trend we saw in the past few weeks.”As volumes rose after the first few hours of trading, volatility returned to markets, sending the CBOE Vix index, dubbed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, 4 per cent higher to 18.5.Modest opening gains on the benchmark S&P 500 index fizzled out after the first hour and stocks traded lower most of the day. However, late activity brought the index fractionally up to 1,412.16. Still, the index fell 2 per cent in October.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent lower at 13,096.54 and lost 2.5 per cent over the month.The session was dominated by sharp moves in shares of companies reporting earnings results. Shares in General Motors jumped after the carmaker’s third-quarter results beat analysts’ estimates.The largest US carmaker by revenues earned solid profits in its domestic business offsetting losses in Europe. The stock rallied 9.5 per cent to $25.50.Rival Ford’s shares also rallied, up 8.2 per cent to $11.16, with investors responding to the carmaker’s earnings results released on Tuesday while markets were still closed.The company reported robust profits, also driven by sales in North America, and earnings per share beat consensus estimates.Eaton, the industrial components maker, cut forecasts for growth in the markets that it serves for the third successive quarter on Wednesday as it announced third-quarter net income 5 per cent below the same quarter last year.However, shares in the company rose 4.6 per cent to $47.22.Genworth Financial shares rallied 8.8 per cent to $5.86 after the insurer reported a profit as losses at its mortgage unit narrowed.Quanta Services shares also soared, rising 9.9 per cent to $25.93 as the company specialising in offering infrastructure solutions to power companies reported estimate-beating third-quarter results. Investors also pushed the price up on expectations that rebuilding and clean-up measures after the storm would bring more business for the company.MasterCard shares rose as the credit card-payment company announced its third-quarter results, beating consensus estimates.The company increased its operational volumes thanks to increased consumer spending. The stock added 1.8 per cent to $460.93.In contrast, Western Union shares plunged 29 per cent to $12.73 after the money transfer and payments company cut its full-year forecast.The company also reported its third-quarter results on Tuesday during the shutdown of markets. The stock has been downgraded by several analysts.The technology-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.4 per cent lower at 2,977.23 and lost 4.5 per cent in October.Apple shares fell 1.4 per cent to $595.32 after the company’s chief executive Tim Cook reshuffled his top management, replacing senior software executive Scott Forstall on Monday. Retail head John Browett also left abruptly after just six months in the job. Shares in the most valuable company on the S&P 500 index fell 10.8 per cent in October.Facebook shares dropped 3.8 per cent to $21.11 as the second lock-up period expired.The expiration coincided with the storm, and Wednesday was the first day that the company’s employees were able to sell about 230m shares.Shares in Netflix soared 13.9 per cent to $79.24 after reports that activist investor Carl Icahn bought a near 10 per cent stake in the video content streaming company.Banking stocks were among the best performers with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley leading gains. Shares in Goldman rose 2.5 per cent to $122.39 while Morgan Stanley added 2.3 per cent to $17.38. JPMorgan added 1.3 per cent to $41.68.Some companies that were originally due to release results on Wednesday were forced to postpone their announcements.Among those, McGraw-Hill Companies, owner of Standard & Poor’s, and Ralph Lauren, rescheduled for Friday. Time Warner Cable rescheduled its release for Monday.
208;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;JPMorgan’s Scharf  to head Visa;;Visa will appoint Charlie Scharf, former head of retail banking at JPMorgan Chase, to succeed Joseph Saunders as its chief executive officer next month as the credit card company broadens its reach outside of the US.Mr Scharf, 47, a former member of Visa’s board and a longstanding associate of JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, will take over the world’s largest payment network on November 1, the company said.Succession plans for Visa were announced earlier this year ahead of Mr Saunders’ upcoming retirement and the end of his contract in March 2013.“This transition has been carefully planned,” Mr Saunders, 66, told the Financial Times. “Charlie is not only eminently qualified to run the company, he also brings a great breadth of experience to Visa.”Mr Scharf’s departure from JPMorgan makes him the latest member of Mr Dimon’s inner circle to leave the bank following executives such as Heidi Miller, former head of international operations.Mr Scharf has worked for Mr Dimon for more than 20 years, following him to a series of companies including Citigroup, Bank One and JPMorgan.“He’s an extremely talented, smart executive, high integrity, high work ethic. Hate to lose him but someone told me a long time ago that people eventually want to spread their wings,” said Mr Dimon.In the past two years Mr Dimon has reshuffled his management ranks, losing or moving aside key executives to make room for a younger generation that is likely to provide his successor. One of the few longstanding lieutenants to retain power at JPMorgan is Mike Cavanagh, now co-head of investment banking.“We have a strong bench and we’ve had a little more upheaval recently than we would like, but change is natural and these things go in cycles,” Mr Dimon said.While serving on Visa’s board, Mr Scharf represented JPMorgan, one of the largest issuers of credit cards in the US. He left his position at the bank’s retail-banking division in June 2011 and since then has been the managing director at One Equity Partners, which manages $10bn of investments for JPMorgan.“My experience at JPMorgan brings great appreciation and understanding to Visa about this important relationship. But we have thousands of other clients and partners,” Mr Scharf said.Mr Scharf will be paid a base salary of $950,000 and be eligible to receive a target bonus that is 250 per cent of that amount, with a maximum bonus opportunity of 500 per cent, according to a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.The move also comes as Visa is boosting investments in new mobile and online technologies, broadening the reach of its credit and debit-card transactions globally.“We will continue to focus on the core business that we have today while also taking growth opportunities outside the US, where on a percentage basis we are growing faster,” Mr Scharf said.Mr Saunders has served as chief executive since 2007 and has led the company through its initial public offering in March 2008 and through the financial crisis, which hurt many of the businesses and banks that work with Visa’s cards.Visa shares have gained about 35 per cent this year, beating the 14 per cent rise in the S&P 500 and reaching a level nearly triple the company’s IPO price.
209;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Guest post: Fulfilling Myanmar’s economic promise;;"By Elizabeth Buse of Visa IncAfter years of international isolation, the government of Myanmar has a golden opportunity to create a fully-inclusive financial system. It should take it.Market forces are already at work in the country. You can see that if you try to book a hotel room in Yangon. They are in short supply and some that were going for less than $70 a year ago have almost tripled to $200. The country has its first investment bank. Government-led market reforms, promoting liberalization and openness, are taking effect and the outside world is coming in, bringing with it investment, commercial opportunities and know-how. However, with few ATMs and fewer point-of-sale terminals where they can use their cards, corporate executives jetting in for investment meetings, or tourists eager to discover the rich culture of Mandalay, find they must still rummage in their billfolds for crisp, clean US dollars.Many observers warn that this lack of financial infrastructure, after years of isolation and sanctions, will hamper progress. However, it is precisely the lack of infrastructure that may well be Myanmar’s biggest advantage, because the country is starting from a relatively clean slate. The government can target growth in sectors important to economic progress, like finance, with relatively flexible approaches that reduce friction in commerce, because it is not limited to working within the confines of legacy infrastructure.Efforts to build infrastructure should not just focus on technological infrastructure. In industries like finance, technology is no doubt critical but an exclusive focus on IT without a supporting framework of rules and regulations for economic growth will be destined for failure. Equally, provision must be made for scalability and mass adoption and this element requires consumer trust. A technologically advanced bank that is well-regulated by authorities will not have a future if consumers don’t have confidence in it. The triumvirate of technology, rules and trust is critical to a well functioning and inclusive financial society.As an example, let’s look at mobile. In Myanmar, fixed line telecommunications systems aren’t in place and amortizing the cost of incremental infrastructure, such as point-of-sale terminals and ATMs, is very difficult. The obvious answer is mobile payments, which have the potential to reach every citizen. But, according to the World Bank, of the 96 mobile payment schemes live in emerging markets around the world in 2011, just six had 200,000 active users or more. In other words, few were achieving anywhere near the scale needed to be a solution to financial exclusion.A successful mobile payment ecosystem consists of a secure and reliable account management platform that enables consumer payments to be stored and managed. Further, rules need to be put in place to ensure that all constituents have clear ways to engage. In the card world, if someone uses your card fraudulently there is an expectation that you are protected. Would the same hold true in the mobile world, if you lose your phone?To answer this and many other questions it is critical that rules exist with a clear delineation of rights and obligations. At a government level, regulations need to contemplate the treatment of new non-banks in the payments chain, such as telecommunications companies. If your mobile phone holds your money and you can buy and borrow from that account, at what point does it become more like a bank account? Policy makers need to grapple with these questions but the good news is that much can be learned from the successes (and failures) of other countries. Finally, even with mobile payments, the scheme has to engender trust. As consumers, we all have expectations that our cards will work at a supermarket or when we travel overseas. That expectation doesn’t change in the mobile world and an interoperable and secure system is critical.With banking modernisation under way in Myanmar, some local banks are preparing for financial integration with the outside world. Additionally, the Central Bank of Myanmar has already indicated a willingness to have international payment schemes operate in the country. All of these are steps in the right direction and certainly more of such efforts should be encouraged. But policymakers should also swiftly put in place a transparent framework for supervision and regulation. Ultimately, free and open competitive markets will give consumers choices and with these choices comes trust.There are not many advantages to being isolated for as many years as Myanmar has been. But a clean slate may well be one of them.Elizabeth Buse is group president of Visa Inc for Asia Pacific, central Europe, the Middle East and Africa[We have replaced the picture published with the original story with a more recent one]Related reading:

210;V;Visa Inc;2012-10-17T14:10:06Z;MasterCard mines data for marketers;;MasterCard is analysing transaction data to help marketers direct targeted advertising at consumers, after launching a controversial initiative to make money from its vast database of retail purchases.This year the credit card network, which processes 34bn purchases each year, began to help marketers target customers who are more likely to buy their products and services.MasterCard first explored the possibility of using customer data for targeted advertising last year, but delayed those plans because of legal and regulatory concerns over how financial services companies use the customer data they have collected.According to an online sales pitch titled “Leveraging MasterCard Data Insights to Reach Holiday Shoppers”, MasterCard analyses billions of transactions – noting, for example, which consumers are more likely to purchase consumer electronics or luxury goods. “The foundation of all of our solutions is transaction data,” Susan Grossman, MasterCard’s senior vice-president of media solutions, said during the pitch, which has been viewed by the Financial Times.MasterCard, which confirmed that it launched the initiative in February, told the FT it was “committed to protecting individual privacy”. It said the information it sells to marketers is anonymous and is aggregated into groups of potential customers – rather than broken out individually.The company said the transaction information it collects includes credit card numbers – which it does not share with advertisers – but not cardholders’ names or other personal details.MasterCard said that the product is US-based, and transaction data from cardholders outside of the US is not being used.As people spend more time in front of computers and mobile phones, companies are amassing vast profiles about people’s activities both online and away from a screen. Facebook, for example, is working with Datalogix, a data company, to track whether people buy products after viewing an ad on the social networking site.Other credit card companies have explored using data for marketing. Visa sells retailers the ability to send text messages to consumers based on their previous credit card transactions – but those targeted agree to receive the ads in return for discounts and other incentives. American Express also conducts custom research for marketers based on aggregated, anonymous credit-card transaction data.The fast-growing industry is raising concern among federal regulators and policy makers. Last week the US Senate Commerce Committee launched an investigation into the practices of nine consumer data brokers. In March the US Federal Trade Commission advocated for legislation to “address the invisibility of, and consumers’ lack of control over, data brokers’ collection and use of consumer information”.“The digital footprint [consumers] will inevitably leave behind will become more specific and potentially damaging, if used improperly,” John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, wrote in a letter to one large data broker.
211;V;Visa Inc;2012-10-12T17:36:57Z;Anonymous withdraws support for WikiLeaks;;WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lost another high-profile supporter as Anonymous, the hacking collective, said the whistleblowing site had been “ruined by egos”.Anonymous, a loose group of internet “hacktivists”, has been one of WikiLeaks’ closest allies during the past two years, launching cyber attacks against the site’s opponents and, some claim, becoming a source of its material.But leading Anonymous accounts on Twitter, which rallied behind WikiLeaks and Mr Assange despite his legal and financial woes, have now withdrawn their support, decrying the freedom-of-information project as a “One Man Julian Assange show”.Calling the split “the end of an era”, Anonymous tweeted: “It was an awesome idea, ruined by egos.”Anonymous rushed to WikiLeaks’ aid in December 2010 when the whistleblowing site faced what it has described as an “economic blockade” from payments processing companies.Anonymous’ attacks caused service interruptions to MasterCard, Visa and PayPal websites, and the group has remained loyal to Mr Assange and his site throughout his extradition battle over allegations of sexual assault, and despite a crackdown from police around the world against the hackers.However, in the same week that saw Mr Assange’s bail guarantors forced by a court to pay £93,500 after he fled to the Ecuadorean embassy in London, Anonymous lashed out at the WikiLeaks founder and his latest fundraising attempt.WikiLeaks this week erected a banner advertisement asking for donations before allowing visitors to access emails purportedly relating to Mitt Romney, the US presidential candidate, and its other archives. Anonymous described the move as “meretricious”.“We have been worried about the direction WikiLeaks is going for a while,” Anonymous wrote in an online statement published overnight on Friday. “In the recent month the focus moved away from actual leaks and the fight for freedom of information further and further while it concentrated more and more on Julian Assange …But WikiLeaks is not – or should not be – about Julian Assange alone.”The final straw for the shadowy group, which has also supported the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring while at the same time attacking companies including Sony and News Corp, appears to have been Mr Assange’s dinner this week with pop star Lady Gaga.“That’s great for him but not much of our interest,” Anonymous said. “We are more interested in transparent governments and bringing out documents and information they want to hide from the public.”WikiLeaks responded on Twitter, saying: “Thank you for drawing attention to our donation campaign while we have high costs in military courts. Solidarity.” The tweet included a link to its donations page.Attempts to reach WikiLeaks for comment were unsuccessful.Not all Anonymous members agreed with the group’s move to part ways with WikiLeaks. One Twitter account, @AnonymousWiki, said the site was “still a beacon of truth and deserves the peoples [sic] support now more than ever”.However, @AnonymousIRC, which posted the press statement, said that while it could not speak for the entire group, discussions with colleagues found that “the vast majority was appalled by this intrusive form of solicitation”.
212;V;Visa Inc;2012-10-11T15:20:33Z;Ethiopia: growing solo;;"Ethiopia appears to be doing something right. One of the world’s five fastest growing economies in 2010, it’s expected to reach 7 per cent growth this year and next and the government hopes for double digit growth in the medium term.But this is not a natural resources bonanza. The economy is still largely dependent on agriculture, but has seen much of its growth from a boost in services. Yet foreign investment is limited, and the country has not benefitted from the non-cash payments revolution that has boosted other countries in the region such as Kenya. No wonder, then, that companies such as Visa are making encouraging noises.In terms of technology, Ethiopia is lagging behind. The country’s mobile penetration is very low against the regional average. Internet connections are slow and unreliable even by African standards, and content is censored.Financial services are also closed. Foreign investment in financial services is prohibited although domestic, non-state providers exist. Financial services are concentrated in a few towns: Addis Ababa, the capital, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of total branches of commercial banks. The country scores low on financial sophistication, technological readiness and innovation according to the African Development Bank, ranking 3.05 out of 7 compared to the continental average of 3.68.In telecommunications, state-owned Ethio Telecom (formerly known as Ethiopian Telecommunications Corp) dominates mobile, internet and telephone landscape. ETC – so bad that peeved nationals have set up an ‘ETC Sucks’ Facebook group – has outsourced some of its services to France Telecom. If this prompts a more liberal approach to areas like electronic payments, it could boost Ethiopia’s growth further.“When we look at the most successful electronic payment systems, they are those that are open, completely open, but the government sets standards for how different entities can participate,” says Elizabeth Buse, Visa’s group president for Asia-Pacific, Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the company’s fastest growing geographies. Visa acquired of phone payment company Fundamo last year as part of its African expansion plans.The general rule of thumb is that a 10 per cent increase in mobile penetration contributes as much as 1.2 per cent to GDP. “The combination of mobile and electronic payments compounds that” says Bill Gajda, Visa’s head of mobile product. Might the government’s position on foreign investment in finance and communications change?“There are a lot of different models being explored, and what we see – and I think Ethiopia won’t be an exception – is that over time, these models open up,” says Gajda. “Closed systems tend to not achieve the scale they want to, there isn’t the level of customer adoption, of direct foreign investment they are looking for, and they evolve over time to where they do bring in companies”.In banking, there are fragile signs of a thaw. Ecobank have said publicly they want a license in Ethiopia, suggesting the authorities may be planning to open up, according to Paul Wallace, Africa editor at The Banker. And perhaps Ethiopia’s plans to woo back the diaspora lend strength to the argument in favour of greater competitiveness in electronic payments. After all, once you’ve got used to easier payment systems in other countries, it’s hard to revert back.Another version of this article appeared on ThisisAfricaRelated reading:

213;V;Visa Inc;2012-09-30T21:07:36Z;Powa in card reader deal with SA bank;;A British challenger to Square, the system that enables credit card payments with a smartphone, has signed its first large multimillion pound deal with one of South Africa’s biggest banks.First National Bank, the retail and corporate division of First Rand, one of the country’s big four banks, will use Powa Technologies’ card reader and software to replace its existing payment infrastructure for an annual fee.While Square, created by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and valued at $3.25bn, sells to small traders new to using cards, Powa’s product, called mPowa, targets existing users through banks and retailers.Dan Wagner, chief executive of Powa, said banks and mobile telephone companies were looking for a way to allow mobile payments while retaining control.His system, which unlike Square works with cards that use a Chip and PIN, is compliant with Level One PCI, the highest security standard.“I take the view that Visa and MasterCard are not going away,” he said. “Google will not be my provider of credit.”“We are a white label solution. Square is a closed system, we are Android,” he added, referring to the ability of anyone to write software for the operating system created by Google.Mr Wagner, a technology entrepreneur who has spent around £8m of his own money developing the product, said it was negotiating with 15 brands, including at least one British bank. Powa already runs ecommerce websites for many stores.He has already attracted the ire of Square, whose lawyers in June sent a letter asking him to stop using an image of a hand holding the card reader similar to Square’s publicity shot.As well as a dongle that plugs into a phone, he produces a chip reader that connects via Bluetooth to send a receipt by text or email to the cardholder’s phone.Users enter their pin as with existing systems. Mr Wagner said it could be used by those with mobile sales forces, such as the AA or Avon, the cosmetics company.Informa, the business information group, uses mPowa to take payment at trade shows.In September, Square closed a $200m fundraising and takes $8bn of payments annually.A 0.25 per cent fee per transaction is levied by mPowa on top of what the card services provider charges, usually around 2.5 per cent.FNB operates in six southern African countries and is about to enter Angola, Ghana and Nigeria. The company, which had sales in 2011 of R25.8bn and 7.1m customers in South Africa, declined to comment.
214;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Technology: Zap, tap and go;Mobile payment systems such as Square promise a new era of commerce – but will they catch on?;"On a bright morning at the ultra-hip Sightglass Coffee shop in San Francisco this week, Brad Miller, a healthcare technology consultant, is in need of a cappuccino.By the time he reaches the counter, his picture has magically appeared on the iPad the shop uses as its payment terminal. The assistant identifies him by his photo and taps the screen to confirm a sale, and Mr Miller picks up his beverage. As he walks out, a receipt drops on to his iPhone.For tech-savvy natives of San Francisco’s South of Market district, a future without cards or cash cannot come fast enough. “I would love to not have to carry around a wallet and not have to worry about paying for things,” says Mr Miller.Such sentiments are music to the ears of the hundreds of companies – from mobile and tech groups to banks and retailers – racing to use new mobile technologies to upend the payments business. In the process, they are putting themselves at the centre of a world of commerce made possible by smartphones and tablets.The potential is causing ripples among investors. Square, the three-year-old start-up behind the payment system used at Sightglass, scored a $3.25bn valuation this week with its latest round of fundraising. It is now one of the most talked-about groups trying to change one of the most basic human activities: spending money.Square, one of about 150 similar payment systems being developed around the world, has become “the pioneer that has driven global attention”, says Bill Gajda, head of mobile products at payments company Visa, turning heads even in countries like Japan and India that are on the forefront of innovation in payments.Square is headed by Jack Dorsey, who also came up with the idea for microblogging service Twitter. The global attention owes much to the app’s radical simplicity and slick design – qualities that have earned Mr Dorsey a budding reputation in the tech industry as heir to Steve Jobs.Square’s smartphone app is linked to a user’s credit card or bank account. Mr Miller keeps it running in the background constantly on his iPhone, with a virtual tab open for him to spend money at Sightglass or any other store using the system. When he is within 100 yards his face appears on the coffee shop’s register, and a single tap is all that is needed to complete a transaction. Security rests on the store assistant identifying him correctly from his picture and billing only for the goods ordered.Stealing a favourite phrase of the late Apple boss, Keith Rabois, Mr Dorsey’s number two at Square, calls the experience “magical” and says of the way it simplifies and cuts the cost of complex payments for small merchants in particular: “It just works.” He also points out that the experience of using Square for the first time prompts some to rave about it on Twitter. “People don’t do that when they’ve just used American Express.”Yet of all the challenges on the way to this post-cash, post-card existence, one stands out: most people are quite happy with the payment methods they already use. “It’s really worth asking the question: is this a technology in search of a problem?” says Brian Walker, a tech analyst at Forrester Research. “Consumers today aren’t challenged by the card swipe.”Ambitious hopes for mobile payments– of waving a phone in front of a cash register; even, like Mr Miller, not even needing to take it out – have been around for as long as the mobile communications industry. “Changing habits takes time,” says David Marcus, president of PayPal, the payment arm of e-commerce site eBay. “Changing habits in money takes more time.”Nor has the technology been perfected. On a second visit to Sightglass the same morning, Mr Miller’s picture does not appear on the store’s register, something he says happens nearly a third of the time. The magic vanishes fast, he adds, when you are left fumbling at the counter to open an app and make a payment.Other new mobile payment systems are also struggling with reliability. An assistant at a Peet’s coffee shop south of San Francisco in Silicon Valley reports that a rival system backed by Google works only about half of the time. Last week a consortium of US mobile operators called Isis delayed the first trials for its own system as it tried to iron out the kinks.In another sign that mobile payment systems may not be ready for prime time, Apple decided not to include the so-called near-field communications technology that lies at the heart of most mobile payments experiments in its latest iPhone, which went on sale on Friday.None of this damps the mood of the optimists. With the cost of putting NFC technology into a cash register falling below $20, it has become a standard component in almost all machines sold, says Mr Gajda. Most handset makers, despite Apple’s hesitation, are building it into devices.…The allure of the smartphone as a central part of commerce explains why companies are backing mobile payment, even if consumers have yet to catch on.This future can be glimpsed at the Silicon Valley headquarters of PayPal, where a series of mock store fronts is used to try out new forms of shopping. PayPal conjures up the example of a passing customer drawn by a pair of knee-high black boots in a store window. The shop is closed so she pulls out her phone and photographs the matrix barcode in the window – it reveals the designer, the price and the fact that her size is in stock. She taps the screen, sending a message to the store owner to set aside a pair. When she returns, her phone “checks in” at the store, giving the shopowner access to her account. As she tries on the boots, an assistant brings a motorcycle jacket she thinks the customer might like, based on the history stored in her PayPal account. The customer takes both, and her PayPal account is debited to the tune of $768.If visions such as this represent a shopping nirvana, then it is not surprising that companies from a handful of giant industries – banking, retailing, mobile communications and technology – are climbing over each other to get in on the act. All have their eyes on the same prize: providing “digital wallets” where smartphone users will keep the new, virtualised methods of payment, along with the many other items – loyalty cards, coupons, gift cards, receipts – accrued in their relationships with merchants.Walmart, Target and a group of other big US retailers last month made a bid for a place at the heart of this new era with joint plans for a digital wallet. Retailers have already gathered extensive information about their customers and are likely to be more trusted than others to protect all the extra data that will flow from the coming wave of mobile commerce, says Dodd Roberts, a consultant to the project, known as MCX.Meanwhile Visa, which has handled nearly $4tn of payments in the past year, argues that banks should put themselves in the driving seat by launching their own digital wallets. Different types of payment – those currently made with cards well as those made through online banking services – could be merged on to the same mobile platform, simplifying relations with customers. Also, access to a wealth of new data about how consumers are interacting with merchants would make it easier for banks to tailor their services to both groups.Not to be outdone, mobile phone companies are trying to elbow their way to the centre of the action. They are well placed to dictate the payment technologies embedded in handsets, says Ryan Hughes, a founder of Isis, which was set up by Verizon Communications, AT&T and T-Mobile USA, the largest US mobile carriers. They also boast extensive customer service operations: lose your phone, they say, and with just one call to a mobile company all your accounts will be made secure.Big tech companies such as Google and Microsoft are also moving in. Apple may have stopped short of mobile payments but it has seen the potential. Passbook, a new feature included in its latest mobile operating system, will hold digital loyalty cards, coupons and tickets, setting the stage for iPods and iPads to subsume a user’s wallet.Whether consumers are ready for the digital wallet is another matter. Mr Miller and his kind are still heavily outnumbered by those wedded to the ritual of handing over a card and signing a receipt or tapping a Pin number into a portable card reader.Nor is it clear that the companies racing to cash in on mobile payments have worked out how to give as much weight to customers’ interests as their own. A world where much of their shopping data are captured and used, for instance, to send discount coupons or targeted advertising may be welcome to some. But it also raises fresh questions about digital privacy – and risks casting smartphone users as passive objects for marketing campaigns.To the optimists, the laws of the market will prevail. Only companies that give consumers something they really want will survive the inevitable shake-out that will hit the fragmented, confusing digital payments landscape likely to emerge in the next few years, says Visa’s Mr Gajda.Whoever is left standing at that point will be in a strong position to cash in on the new world of mobile payments and commerce.Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw"
215;V;Visa Inc;2012-09-19T18:11:47Z;Smartphones have not yet digested payments;Apple’s view is that consumers still prefer to pay with cards or cash;Are smartphones about to swallow the payments business? Two events this week have given sharply contradictory answers.The first was the $3.25bn valuation put on Square, a Silicon Valley payments start-up, by the company’s latest round of fundraising. This represents a huge bet, given that Square is a business with annualised revenues of only about $200m that is battling with the giants of the banking, retail and mobile industries.A very different message is given in the design of Apple’s Passbook, launched on Wednesday. A new feature in the latest version of the iOS mobile operating system, Passbook has many of the features of what has come to be known as a ‘digital wallet’: you can use it to store virtual loyalty cards, discount coupons, gift cards, tickets – many of the things, in fact, that clutter up physical wallets.The main functionality missing from Apple’s phone, however, is a way to make a payment. While Google plunged into this business some time ago with its own mobile payment service, Apple’s bet is that consumers still prefer to pay with a card or hard cash.In one sense, Apple and Square are not as far apart as they may seem. Both are aiming at the same outcome: helping merchants forge closer relationships with their customers, up to and including facilitating actual transactions. But, as always with new technologies that rely on sweeping changes in consumer behaviour before they can reach their full potential, getting the timing right is everything.To see Square as purely a payments company would be a mistake. At the current rate, it is handling $8bn of payments a year – not a bad start, although barely a pinprick in the greater scheme of things. It would be a foolhardy strategy to compete head-on against giants of the payments industry, which reap small margins on massive volumes of transactions. But the fact that Visa is a shareholder in Square is an indication that their businesses are complimentary, not competitive. Square pays a large slice of the fees it levies on payments over to the credit card companies.In fact, payment is the wedge that Square is using to pry open a bigger market. It gets a foot in the door with the small merchants who are its main customers by making it easy to collect credit card payments, Its deeper appeal, though, rests on the data and analytical tools it gives them to understand their customers better. Its smartphone app also acts as a digital wallet, giving merchants a way to tie in customers through loyalty programmes, discounts and special offers.Digital wallets, in fact, could eventually supply one of the main answers to the conundrum facing the internet and media industries as their users switch en masse to mobile: how to make money in a medium where traditional forms of advertising don’t work?Eventually, with a wealth of information about actual purchases, married to the data collected from its mobile app, Square may be in a position to direct highly targeted advertising and offers to its users.Others see the same potential to use mobile payments as a way of creating closer relationships between merchants and consumers, all the way to stimulating transactions. Eventbrite, an online ticket marketplace, has added a payment system to let its customers make sales, creating a mobile box office to round out its service.Apple’s bet with Passbook, meanwhile, is that there is much that can be done with mobile apps to draw consumers and merchants closer to a transaction, but handling an actual payment is not yet part of the mix.Technology standards are still in flux and surveys point to high levels of consumer concern about the privacy and security risks from making a payment simply by waving a smartphone.There is also the payment industry’s unavoidable chicken-and-egg problem: how to get customers to try out a payment system that most merchants have yet to adopt, and vice versa. This is the biggest single problem faced by Square, whose payment app is designed to let a consumer make a purchase in a store without even pulling out a phone. The company scored a coup last month when it secured a deal with – and investment from – Starbucks. But Starbucks will not be enabling the full Square payment experience in its stores.Not that Apple is sitting on its hands. In an EasyPay experiment earlier this year, it began letting visitors to its stores buy by phone: first download an app, then point your iPhone’s camera at the bar code and just walk out with your purchase. As with many other aspects of the retail business, the Apple Store could be the place to go for a real glimpse of the future.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast managing editor
216;V;Visa Inc;2012-09-18T22:38:20Z;Square – upwardly mobile;Ambitious payments service hampered by high fees and big tech rivals;Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ boss, has called mobile payments “the fastest growing opportunity we’ve ever seen in terms of customer acceptance”. That explains why the coffee shop chain is investing in Square, the company led by Jack Dorsey (the co-founder of Twitter) that aims to become the default “wallet” service for mobile payments. The latest round of financing, to which Starbucks contributed, shows how high expectations for the business have become. The fundraising – $200m – values Square at $3.25bn.Various companies play roles in the payment processing chain. Square makes a plastic card reader that enables the start of the process to occur over smartphones and iPads as well as software for initiating payments with the wave of a phone. Charging a 2.75 per cent transaction fee, Square claims to be processing $8bn in payments on an annualised basis. To put that in context, Visa processed nearly $4tn of payments in the last year.If Square can drive its volumes to say, 1 per cent of Visa’s level, or $40bn five years from now, it would make $1bn in annual revenue. Visa-like margins of 60 per cent would mean net profit of some $225m, suggesting that the latest investors paid a reasonable 14 times future earnings. But that is unlikely. The majority of the 2.75 per cent fee goes straight back to credit card companies. Unless the business has extraordinarily low operating and marketing costs, it is hard to see how Square makes much money, even when it is processing five times today’s volumes.Clearly, Square needs to achieve enough scale to negotiate better terms with credit card companies. And, with companies including Google and PayPal mobilising with their own wallets, competition on share and fees will be fierce. Like all big opportunities, it will attract big opportunists.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
217;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
218;V;Visa Inc;2012-09-13T18:19:06Z;Apple snubs key NFC mobile payment method;;Apple’s decision to exclude a near field communications (NFC) chip from its new iPhone handset will threaten the adoption of contactless mobile payment systems, analysts have warned.NFC is being promoted as the payment method of the future, with Visa, MasterCard and Google – as well as mobile phone manufacturers Samsung and Nokia – making substantial commitments to the technology.But, following the iPhone launch, Tudor Aw, KPMG’s European Head of Technology, said that Apple’s snub could hold back the adoption of NFC.“It had been hoped that Apple would turn its famous ability to deliver new technology through great user experience to kick-start the widespread adoption of mobile payments by consumers,” he said. “The interesting question is whether this omission will mean further delay in mobile payments taking off – or if it presents an opportunity for its competitors to take a lead in this field.”Instead of NFC, Apple’s iPhone offers the ‘Passbook’, where users can store electronic coupons, vouchers and even airline tickets. They can make payments using a barcode displayed on the phone’s screen.Widely reported comments from Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, suggest Apple still sees NFC as a technology in search of a problem and that it believes Passbook fulfils most users’ needs.However, some industry observers believe Apple may still include NFC in future phones.“The reality is that we’re still two to three years away from mass adoption of mobile payments and, with so many companies jostling for attention in this space, it’s likely Apple will wait another 12 months before including NFC in iPhone technology,” said James Richards, vice-president of mobile at Intelligent Environments, the digital banking company.NFC technology developers insist Apple’s snub will not stop wider adoption of the technology.“NFC is going to progress at a pace without Apple – this could be Apple’s loss,” said Miles Quitmann, managing director of Proxama, a company that offers NFC wallet technology.Aside from NFC, the other significant hardware omission was the lack of support for the microUSB connector standard backed by the EU and the GSMA, the European-based mobile phone trade group.MicroUSB is already used by Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Research In Motion and Nokia for charging their handsets and for exchanging data with other devices.But Apple has introduced a new proprietary connector called ‘Lightning’ with the iPhone 5. In a minor concession to the EU and GSMA lobby, however, it has agreed to sell a Lightening-to-microUSB adaptor in its European stores. The adapter will cost £15 in the UK (€19).

220;V;Visa Inc;2012-09-07T11:23:29Z;Indonesia credit cards: going solo;;"After restrictions on foreign banks, foreign mining companies and foreign fruit and vegetables, the latest protectionist push in Indonesia is focused on credit card payment systems.Bank Indonesia, the central bank, and a number of major state-owned banks are trying to breathe new life into an old proposal to develop a national credit card payment system to break the dominance of MasterCard and Visa, as has been done in China with UnionPay.Y F Sri Suparni, BI’s director for payment systems, told local journalists at a briefing this week that discussions on the plan had become “more intensive” recently.Although there are still only around 7m credit card holders and 15m credit cards in this nation of 240m people, the numbers are growing by around 7 – 8 per cent a year as the large middle-class continues to expand.Credit card sales, which average around Rp1,700bn ($178m) per month, are growing at 12-13 per cent a year, according to Dodit Probojakti, who manages the credit card division at state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia, Indonesia’s fourth-biggest bank by assets.While this growth is steady rather than spectacular, bankers believe the number of card users is likely to take off in the coming years as credit cards become more widely used and more and more people shop online.With more than 90 per cent of credit card transactions in Indonesia involving two domestic parties, local banks, backed by the central bank, want to grab a bigger slice of the rapidly expanding fee income that Visa and MasterCard earn.“I think its time for state-owned banks to start thinking in that direction and BI has asked us to drive this,” Probojakti told beyondbrics. “It will drive the cost down because we can negotiate with Visa and MasterCard to have a better pricing structure or we can create our own.”Another senior banker in Jakarta said that BI’s plan was not just about economic nationalism but was part of a bigger global shift by emerging market governments keen to keep financial data and transactions onshore.“Following the 2007-08 global financial crisis, regulators and national governments are much more concerned about the safety of payment systems, banking systems and information,” he said.Creating a trusted nationwide payment system is costly and complicated but Indonesia’s Bank Central Asia already has its own extensive closed loop system.“It’s technically possible and it is likely to take a long time but this will be worrying for Visa and MasterCard,” said the senior banker. “It’s a challenge to their dominance.”Visa and MasterCard both said they were open to discussing collaboration with the Indonesian authorities and that they were happy to compete on a “level playing-field”.The problem for the credit card giants is that Indonesian officials, with an eye on national elections in 2014, are increasingly talking about tilting the playing field toward domestic companies.Still, Visa and MasterCard can take some comfort from the fact that while Indonesian officials like to issue proposals about many things, from building a national car to creating a unified time zone, they are not so good at implementing them.Related reading

221;V;Visa Inc;2012-09-05T22:23:54Z;MasterCard sets pact to enter Myanmar;;MasterCard Worldwide has become the first international payments network to grant a licence to a Myanmar bank, paving the way for issuance and acceptance of branded credit and debit cards in the country.The move follows an agreement last month by Visa, MasterCard’s rival, to train selected local banks to use electronic-payments systems as a first step towards a similar, but yet to be finalised, deal to license local banks for card issuance. China UnionPay and Japan Credit Bureau are among other financial services firms negotiating with local banks to bring in branded cards.International sanctions against Myanmar and domestic restrictions on currency exchange and other transactions have prevented the use of credit card facilities and international ATM networks for decades in Myanmar. The result has caused problems for tourists and business travellers alike. Since the easing of most sanctions earlier this year, financial services firms have been negotiating with banks on a vast range of services and products.A new foreign investment law, which is expected to facilitate the entry of foreign business to Myanmar, has been bogged down in parliament, frustrating many would-be investors.On the financial front, new laws will have to be enacted to open up the banking sector. However, domestic banks have already received approval to move forward with some aspects of liberalisation, including on foreign exchange, letters of credit and other international transactions, while more than 14 foreign banks have gained permission to open representative offices.MasterCard’s licence agreement with Myanmar’s Co-Operative Bank, one of the country’s 19 private commercial banks, will see the issuance of MasterCard branded cards and the acceptance of MasterCard/Maestro/Cirrus cards by a new network of automated teller machines.ATMs were only introduced in Myanmar earlier this year and the system is still in its infancy, with a total of about 82 ATMs throughout Myanmar. Co-Operative Bank claims the biggest ATM network in the country with 24 machines. Foreign cards are still not acceptedIssuing the licence is the first crucial step in the process of building up credit card acceptance in Myanmar, a MasterCard spokesman said. While Co-Operative Bank would ultimately determine the timing, “in our experience, the first MasterCard branded cards can be issued anywhere from three to 12 months after the licence has been issued”, he said.International financial institutions have forecast that Myanmar’s economy will expand by 5.2-6 per cent in 2012-13, while tourism industry projections suggest tourist arrivals could increase in 2012 by 40- 50 per cent from last year.Already, 2011 saw a record 816,369 tourism arrivals in Myanmar, almost double the 2003 level and up from 791,505 in 2010, according to official figures. In the first four months of 2012, the country received nearly 130,000 foreign visitors, a 36 per cent increase from the same period last year.The tourism industry is set for further gains next year when Myanmar hosts the Southeast Asian Games and a regional World Economic Forum meeting, and in 2014 when the country becomes chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.The issuing and acceptance of branded cards in the country will inevitably “have a huge impact on tourism and travel, and will bring more of Myanmar’s citizens into the financial system”, said Vicky Bindra, MasterCard Worldwide’s president for Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa. “Electronic payments will also be crucial in helping Myanmar connect to the global economy.”
222;V;Visa Inc;2012-09-04T16:52:58Z;EU set to approve UK mobile wallet system;;Britain’s largest mobile phone payment platform, which is being created by the three leading network operators, is set to be granted unconditional EU approval despite objections by rivals such as Google.Vodafone, Telefónica’s O2 and Everything Everywhere – the merged UK businesses of Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom – have been preparing for the launch of a “mobile wallet” system this summer.Those with knowledge of the talks about the venture – codenamed Project Oscar – told the Financial Times in July that it was expected to be given approval by the competition authorities. The decision is now due this week after some delay, according to those with knowledge of the situation.The payments technology is designed to be easily adopted by retailers, banks and financial services companies to allow mobile phones to be used as a secure alternative to cash and credit cards.On the back of these third party services, the mobile operators envisage revenue generating opportunities for advertising, billing and sales that can run across the operators. The digital “cards” stored in phones could be kept when switching networks.Mobile payment systems are seen by telecoms groups as a key area for revenue growth to offset declining parts of their businesses, especially as more phones use the near field communication (NFC) technology that allows a phone to be “swiped” for payment. The latest smartphones being launched this month by Apple, Nokia and Samsung are expected to feature NFC technology.The operator joint venture that owns the platform had been opposed by rivals such as Google, which has its own plans for a mobile wallet, as well as Three, the smallest UK mobile operator, which was concerned about its exclusion from the business. There were concerns that the venture would have monopolistic powers of control over the fledgling mobile payments industry, prompting an in-depth investigation by Europe’s competition watchdog.The European Commission’s approval means that the mobile operators will be able to compete with rival payment platforms such as the rumoured Google Wallet, which is also expected this autumn, although it is not yet known which will be first to the market.● Monitise, the technology company that provides mobile payments systems for Visa and UK high street banks, has doubled full-year revenues for the third successive year on the back of the growing use of phone-based payments.Monitise, which is 10 per cent owned by Visa, provided the technology behind the mobile payments services used at the London Olympics.Full-year revenues rose to £36.1m, from £15.3m in the previous year, with gross margins up from 62 per cent to 66 per cent. There was a group earnings loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £10.4m for the year owing to investments in technology and on acquisitions as it sought to grow its customer base globally, although this figure had narrowed by £1.5m on the previous year.
223;V;Visa Inc;2012-08-30T16:34:41Z;Gemalto lifts forecast on mobile boom;;Gemalto lifted its profit targets for 2012 on Thursday saying that the move to mobile banking and mobile payments had boosted demand for the company’s security software.Gemalto, best known for providing the security features on mobile phone Sim cards, said it expected to reach €300m in operating profit this year, a year earlier than planned.The company, one of Europe’s largest listed software companies by revenues, beat analyst expectations in the first half with profits up 56 per cent to €115m and revenues passing €1bn for the first time.Sales at Gemalto’s mobile business, which accounts for nearly half of all revenues, were up 6 per cent in the first half.“The results show that all these large trends – the world becoming more digitised, the growth of mobile transactions – are really helping us,” said Olivier Piou, chief executive.A number of banks and mobile operators have launched services in the past year allowing customers to pay for items and transfer money using their mobile handsets. Both Walmart and Starbucks in the US, for example, recently announced mobile wallet plans.Visa and Samsung, meanwhile, showcased technology at the London Olympic Games, which allowed customers to pay for food and goods with mobile phones.Juniper Research predicts that mobile payments could reach $1.7tn by 2017 – or about 4 per cent of all global retail transactions.“A lot of start-ups in these areas, such as Square, are making a lot of noise. But people don’t know that we are already providing security for more than 800m customers on our platforms,” Mr Piou said.Gemalto provides security software for Barclays’ mobile and online banking services in the UK. It also provides security for Chase, one of the big four US banks, and América Móvil, one of Latin America’s biggest mobile operators.“Our products are in most consumers’ pockets in one way or another,” said Mr Piou.Gemalto, which has a market valuation of more than €5.2bn, was previously known as a maker of Sim cards, but has diversified over the past few years to provide security software for other uses.This year, for example, the company won a contract with the UK’s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to provide the next generation of digitised drivers’ licences.Revenues were up 7 per cent at €1.016bn, while pre-tax profits rose 17.5 per cent to €107.5m. Earnings per share were €1.09.Shares in Gemalto, which have nearly doubled in value over the past year, rose a further 6.6 per cent to €63.37 in early afternoon trading.
224;V;Visa Inc;2012-08-21T13:22:46Z;Anonymous attacks UK government websites;;The hacking group Anonymous says it has attacked a number of government websites in protest against the UK’s handling of the Julian Assange extradition case.The Home Office and Ministry of Justice websites became unreachable after hackers flooded the computers running the sites with hundreds of thousands of requests for information, known as a distributed denial of service attack.The Number 10 Downing Street website, the Department of Work and Pensions and the official website of the British royal family were also attacked.Mr Assange, who founded the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website, has taken refuge inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning on sexual assault charges, which he denies.Mr Assange has said he is concerned that the Swedish government would extradite him to the US which has been angered by WikiLeaks revelations and has launched an investigation against the organisation.On Sunday night Mr Assange made a speech from the balcony of the embassy, calling on the US to “end the witch hunt” against WikiLeaks. The UK government has said it will not grant Mr Assange safe passage out of the country, despite the Ecuadorean decision to grant him political asylum.Anonymous, a loose collection of hackers, which often uses Twitter to publicise its exploits, sent messages on the microblogging site on Monday night urging members to join its #OpFreeAssange campaign.The group attacked UK government sites in April this year to protest against the UK’s extradition arrangements to the US as well as against proposed new data interception laws.Anonymous also launched a series of attacks on Visa and MasterCard two years ago after the companies stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks, choking off the organisation’s source of funding.The Ministry of Justice confirmed it had been the subject of an online protest starting at 9pm on Monday but it reassured the public that no data had been taken by the hackers.“This is a public information website and no sensitive data are held on it. No other Ministry of Justice systems have been affected. Measures put in place to keep the website running mean that some visitors may be unable to access the site intermittently. We will continue to monitor the situation and will take measures accordingly,” the ministry said in a statement.
225;V;Visa Inc;2012-08-17T14:54:10Z;More companies join mobile payments rush;Household names get behind smartphone projects;"With Wal-Mart and Starbucks both announcing plans in the past week to make it easier for customers to pay using smartphones, the mobile payments market is finally moving into the mainstream.The bold prediction by PayPal that by 2016 people would no longer need to take their traditional leather wallet with them on shopping excursions seems less futuristic as big household names get behind mobile wallet projects.It is not just retailers who are looking to claim the increasingly crowded market for mobile payments. Google Wallet launched in the US last year, while three of the big US telecoms operators, Verizon, T-Mobile USA and AT&T are developing a service known as Isis.Elsewhere, Ebay’s PayPal unit, has also launched an app that allows users to pay for items with their mobile phones across a number of stores in the UK and Barclays has launched Pingit, a mobile-to-mobile money transfer service earlier this year.The Mobile Money Network has a payment app that can be used in stores such as Carphone Warehouse, Thorntons and HMV and the UK’s biggest operators are planning their own wallet service, nicknamed Project Oscar.Visa has also invested heavily in mobile payments services and predicts that by 2020 over half of all the payments it processes will come from mobiles.The danger is that consumers will be left confused by these competing offerings and stick to more familiar options such as credit and debit cards, or cash.“The market won’t sustain more than a a few of these services and so there will have to be a big shakeout,” says Steve Ledford, partner at Novantas, the US-based management consulting company.“It is a safe bet that nine out of 10 of these will fail. The more difficult thing is knowing which ones,” he said.One of the reasons for so many different offerings for mobile payments is that a number of factions are vying to control the mobile customer relationship. Banks do not want to lose their role as a primary handler of payments. The mobile operators want to make money from their close relationship with mobile handset owners, and retailers want to avoid being charged heavy fees for using a new payment mechanism.When Wal-Mart and its peers announced they are building their own mobile payment system, they said part of the reason for doing so was “eliminating unnecessary costs to all stakeholders”.All of them would like access to the details about consumers’ shopping habits that can be gleaned by monitoring mobile payments – what are people buying, where and at what time.The danger, say some industry analysts, is that the proliferation of competing and incompatible mobile payment systems will confuse consumers. Significantly the US-based Electronic Transactions Association formed a Mobile Payments Committee last week in a effort to oordinate the wide range of mobile payment inititives underway, establish standards and prevent fragmentation in an effort to c.The committee consists of the big four US mobile operators, Verizon, whose Federal Relations Director chairs the group; AT&T; T-Mobile USA; and Sprint which partnered with Google to launch the Google Wallet using NFC (near field communications) technology.Among the others involved in the initiative are Google, Wells Fargo, Paypal, and Isis. Credit card companies,including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and Capitol One, have also signed on.“All the three main parties – banks, retailers and mobile operators – are all having a go at this. There is now an initiative from all of them,” said Fred Huet, analyst at Greenwich Consulting.It is still hard to tell whether any of the mobile wallet services are gaining real traction, with scant data available publicly. Visa, which was looking to showcase contactless payments at the London Olympics said about 15 per cent of all payments under £20 were made using a contactless card or mobile phone.However, an IT failure that prevented tills at Wembley Stadium from taking Visa credit or debit card payments during one of the Olympics matches may have undermined Visa’s attempts to showcase the new technology during the games.PayPal, meanwhile, said it was expecting to process $10bn in payments made on mobile devices this year, up from $4bn last year.However, overall, usage levels are still low. Starbucks has seen perhaps one of the biggest successes in this area, with more than 1m people a week using Starbucks’ mobile application to pay for their coffees. But this is still less than 2 per cent of the over 60m weekly transactions at the coffee shop chain.“We haven’t seen any of the wallets really take off yet. Someone getting a little bit of traction can can go a long way at this point,” said Hank Israel, partner at Novantas.Clunky customer service and difficulties setting up mobile payments accounts are turning many customers off, says Mr Huet. “Barclays Pingit is a good idea, for example, but installing it is too complicated and has stopped people adopting it,” he says.Nevertheless, if those involved in developing mobile payments can strike the right balance and develop services that consumers find convenient and easy, and above all else is secure, the potential is enormous. Juniper Research predicts that mobile payments could reach $1,700bn by 2017 - or about 4 per cent of all global retail transactions."
226;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;The partnership of coffee and tech;;Coffee and techies go together like donuts and policemen, one the voracious consumer of the other. They have named programming languages after the stuff. And so the alliance between Starbucks and Jack Dorsey’s Square mobile payments start-up seems quite natural.Starbucks has never been shy of experimenting with technology, having been one of the first US coffee shop chains to offer customers free wi-fi access. Starbucks also has its own mobile app, which allows customers to pay for their coffees using a phone. Although these mobile payments are still just a tiny fraction of overall revenues, it is considered one of the most successful mobile payments systems in use so far. Starbucks even recruits from the tech world, having brought in ecommerce entrepreneur Adam Brotman, in 2009 to oversee its digital developments.But is there a danger that the coder-coffee continuum is becoming cozy to the point of representing a conflict of interest? Jack Dorsey is, after all, already an investor in another coffee company, San Francisco’s Sightglass Coffee. It is a single shop, not quite the empire Starbucks controls, but became an early adopter of Square technology following Dorsey’s investment.Another, slightly more uncomfortable series of links is with Visa, which also invested in Square last year and has a seat on the advisory board. Visa recently stopped Visa payments from being made in a number of Scandinavian countries using iZettle, Square’s Swedish rival. No clear reason has emerged for this. But it all feels, well, a little bit cozy.
227;V;Visa Inc;2012-08-06T21:23:00Z;Nuance’s Nina is more business-like Siri;;It’s an open secret that Nuance powers the speech-recognition capabilities of Apple’s Siri personal assistant, whose capabilities will increase this autumn with the iOS 6 update allowing it to answer questions about sports scores, movies and restaurants, as well as opening hard-to-find apps with a voice command.But Apple has not allowed third-party developers to integrate Siri into their apps yet, something that Nuance is offering from today with its Siri soundalike, Nina, for iOS and Android devices.Nina exploits Nuance’s natural language processing (NLP) smarts that makes possible structured conversations with these kinds of digital personal assistants.Nuance is offering a software developer kit (SDK) for app developers to include Nina in their offerings along with a cloud service that will do NLP and voice biometrics.Nina’s biometric capabilities can authenticate users to access their data using their voice pattern, rather than having them input the usual user ID and password.Nina has what Nuance describes as “navigate” capabilities to take users wherever they want to go in an app and “transact”, for things like booking a flight, paying a bill and transferring funds.In a demo, Nina had the same female voice as the US version of Siri, although Nuance executives said it had 40 different voices that could be used.A sample banking app I was shown received accurate Nina-spoken answers to this succession of questions and instructions: “Find the nearest ATM”, “What are your mortgage rates?” “What is my account balance?”, “How much did I spend this month?”, “Show me transactions over $250”,“How about in March?”, and then “Pay a bill on Friday to Visa of $185.35”.“This is very different from what Apple has done, which is creating an Apple product that defines an Apple experience to consumers,” said Robert Gary, general manager of Nuance Mobile Care.“This allows an enterprise to express themselves to their consumers with a heavy emphasis on their vertical depth.”The first customer to license Nina is USAA, a financial services provider that is launching a pilot version of its mobile app this month.For direct-to-consumer apps, Nuance already has Dictation and Dragon Go!, the latter allowing users to speak a search query and receive tabbed and targetted text-based results.
228;V;Visa Inc;2012-07-25T22:49:55Z;Visa reports loss after settling suit;;Visa, the world’s largest payments network, reported a quarterly net loss of $1.8bn after it set aside more than $4bn to cover litigation costs related to a dispute over fees charged to US merchants.Excluding the provision, Visa’s net income for its fiscal third quarter was $1.1bn, or $1.56 per share, up 25 per cent over the same period a year ago and ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.45 per share, according to a Bloomberg survey.The company raised its full-year earnings forecast for the second time this year, saying a growing number of customers are moving to card-based payments globally. The company also announced a new $1bn share repurchase programme.Joseph Saunders, Visa’s chief executive, said growth in global payments volume, cross border and processed transactions outside the US was “solid”.Net operating revenue rose 10 per cent to reach $2.6bn in the quarter. The increase was driven by double-digit growth in service, data processing and international transaction revenues.There was no significant impact on the results related to movements of the US dollar, the company said.Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard put an end to a seven-year legal battle with US retailers by agreeing to a settlement of at least $6bn. The US merchants had accused the payment networks of fixing the price of fees retailers must pay every time consumers use cards for purchases.Visa’s share of the settlement was about $4.4bn, while that of MasterCard, which is scheduled to report results next week, previously announced the settlement would cost it $790m.Visa shares have risen almost 40 per cent this year in part because investors have welcomed the terms of the settlement. Visa shares were up 1.5 per cent in extended trading after the earnings release..“We are pleased that we were able to come to a resolution in the merchant litigation which was acceptable to most parties while ensuring the long-term health of the US payments industry,” Mr Saunders said in a statement. “We remain focused on launching new payment solutions and products for our financial and merchant partners and consumers, while supporting the Visa brand and the advancement of electronic payments.”
229;V;Visa Inc;2012-07-25T19:39:18Z;Social media make mark at London games;;"Days after Gabrielle Douglas, the American gymnast, made the US Olympic team, the 16-year-old posted to Twitter a picture of flowers, cake and a giant plastic tub filled with paper towels, soap, deodorant and mouthwash. The package was a congratulatory gift from her new sponsor Procter & Gamble, the consumer packaged goods company.“I love all of my goodies thank you so much for everything!” she tweeted to her 29,000 followers.The message represents a new wave of athletic endorsements, where a star’s presence on Twitter, Facebook and the like factors into which athletes marketers choose to sponsor. Those endorsement contracts often require that athletes share messages, photos and videos about the brand with their social media fans.Several of those relationships are taking centre stage during the 2012 London Olympics. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt recently posted a photo of a refrigerator filled with Gatorade sports drink to his 620,000 Twitter followers. Michael Phelps, the American swimmer, mentions Visa, Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Hilton Hotels amid the training updates he shares with his 5.4m Facebook fans.“It is an absolute phenomenon,” said Lowell Taub, the global head of sports endorsements at Creative Artists Agency talent agency who is representing several athletes competing in this year’s games.“With almost every single deal that my group puts together, sponsors ask, ‘Can you tell me about the athlete’s social media footprint, how many Twitter followers do they have? How many Facebook fans? Will they do some tweets for the campaign?”The online sponsorship battle is just one reason some people are dubbing the London Olympics the Social Media Games.“We are at a dawn of a new age of sharing and connecting and London 2012 will ignite the first conversational Olympic Games thanks to social media platforms and technology,” says Alex Huot, head of social media for the International Olympic Committee.The four years since the last summer Olympics have ushered in a new era of digital media. Facebook has 900m users, up from 100m in 2008. Twitter has 140m users, up from 6m in 2008. Other popular social media programmes, such as Pinterest, Instagram, and Foursquare did not even exist for the Beijing Olympics.As the Olympic torch makes its way to London, social media are lighting up with posts about the games. There were more tweets about the Olympics on a single day during a recent week than the total number of tweets during the entire Beijing Summer Olympics, according to Twitter.Can an ad for an egg-and-spoon race contravene the Olympics’ strict rules on branding and constitute ambush marketing? Seemingly, yesAthletes are taking to the medium by storm. Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova on Monday shared a picture to her 7.7m Facebook fans of her first trip to the Olympic Park to pick up her credentials. After basketball star Kobe Bryant gave her a pair of Nike shoes Australian swimmer Stephanie Rice posted a photo of them to Instagram.The trend has yielded some unsavoury moments. A Greek triple jumper was expelled from her team after she tweeted comments that were deemed racist about African athletes and forwarded tweets by a far-right politician to her followers.LeBron James, basketball player

43,864 followersBut it is when the conversation turns to the business of sponsorship that things get more complicated.Strict guidelines from the International Olympic Committee encourage Olympic athletes to use social media but bar them from mentioning commercial sponsors without a special waiver. Those rules could mute the impact of endorsements from marketers that are not official Olympic sponsors.A flurry of social media activity about the games also could make it difficult for a sponsor’s message to stand out – particularly if the athlete is endorsed by multiple brands.Meanwhile, many Olympic athletes view the games as their shot to land sponsorship deals and have to be careful to use social networks to interact with fans but not to annoy followers with too many commercial messages.Hoping that an Olympian’s halo would extend to the brand, marketers for years have struck sponsorship deals with athletes based on the star’s performance on the field, looks and personality, among other factors.Until recently, marketers had to spend sponsorship budgets on both endorsement contracts and advertisements promoting relationships with athletes. That dynamic has changed now that athletes can promote themselves through social media followings that rival the audiences of traditional media.“Brands are smart enough to say, ‘You are having a direct dialogue with your fans. Please try to include our message in that communication.’”said Kevin Adler, founder of Engage Marketing, a Chicago sports and entertainment marketing company.Indeed, most Olympic sponsors including Procter & Gamble, Visa and General Electric are incorporating athletes’ social media presence into their Olympic marketing campaigns.General Electric created a Facebook application that lets users to “workout like an Olympian.” GE selected the four athletes featured in the campaign, in large part, because of their social media presence, said Linda Boff, global executive director of digital and advertising at GE. ““That part was really important to us,” she said. “This is the social games.”"

People who don’t keep scores and who shrug off slights because they do not notice them. People who swing between happy-go-lucky and carefree and back again, people who are strangers to huge flights of fancy and the doldrums. You know who you are.I wonder how it feels to put your Visa debit card in to the machine at the corner shop and see the word “approved” or “accepted” flash on the screen and not experience a little stab of joy that your character passes muster?I wonder how it feels to be a person who is not cut to the quick when she sees that a favourite local restaurant, which started doing well and bought the place next door but could not sustain both premises, and has had to shut down altogether?What does the inside of the brain look like of a person who does not ponder for hours on end the nature of the thing that isn’t said, or the thing that was mumbled but not repeated, even at the second request?What would life be if you didn’t get wildly embarrassed when anyone used the word “eclectic”?What must it be like to start your Christmas shopping in December? What would driving a car be like, filling the boot with groceries and the back with children?What must it feel like to harbour no childhood dinner sorrows, such as the time you went to a fancy restaurant at five years old, and you boldly ordered the steak Rossini, which was delicious, and you had nine mouthfuls and put your knife and fork down for a second to take a sip from your glass and the pesky waiter whisked away your plate (and your hopes and dreams)?There are persons, I believe, who possess natural bounce-back-ability.This is apparently not just a character trait we are born with but a skill that can be learnt on a resilience course. There are people who Google resilience courses and see they are all the rage because resilience is the capacity to tolerate excessive demands and stresses without experiencing any stress-related problems or threats to performance – and who wouldn’t want that?There are, perhaps, people who telephone the number straight away in a state of high excitement and do not feel stung when the fellow at the end of the line says he only runs resilience courses in the workplace for 12 people and not in the home, to order, you great silly.…There are people who do not feel dreadfully guilty when they are brought a bunch of flowers that is only half as nice as the one that is already sitting on the table.There are people who go for pedicures on their birthday, in their best sandals, and are assessed by the receptionist for a fitting magazine match and are promptly given Good Housekeeping to read, and do not take it at all personally, but perhaps not many.There are people who go a whole month without entering a hospital building.There are people who when other people remark, “Your daughter is so beautiful, she takes after her father,” do not give those people a big thump, or dream of doing so.There are people who go to an end of term mass for children and are not appalled to hear the priest begin the service by asking the girls aged five to 11 to say a big sorry for all the wrong things they have done.There are people who detect a wildly unjust comment in their daughter’s school report and are not stung and do not write letters of protest to the headteacher, in their head, livid in the small hours, losing six hours sleep over it, several nights in a row. There may be persons who, in this situation, do not think of telephoning their lawyer and citing character defamation and demanding a formal retraction, and damages.But I am glad to say, thank God, I am not one of them.susie.boyt@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/boyt

Analysts had forecast earnings on average of $1.10 a share, according to Bloomberg.Kenneth Chenault, chairman and chief executive, said the company was closely managing discretionary expenses in response to an “uncertain economic outlook” but it would continue to make substantial investments in marketing initiatives and on its loyalty programmes.Consolidated expenses rose 2 per cent to $5.6bn in the past quarter versus $5.5bn in 2011. Amex had the benefit of these expense levels being reduced in the previous period by settlement payments from MasterCard and Visa totalling $220m, related to a lawsuit over anti-competitive behaviour.The US commerce department reported on Monday that retail sales in the country, which accounts for about two-thirds of Amex’s revenue, fell for a third month in June. Still, Amex’s net income from US card services rose 8 per cent in the second quarter to $718m.A shift towards global commercial services, which reported a 24 per cent jump in second-quarter income to $219m, also boosted Amex’s results.“Consumer, small business and corporate card member spending, along with the business volumes generated by our network of bank partners, remained healthy despite a very uneven economy,” said Mr Chenault.Earlier this year, Amex boosted its quarterly dividend by 11 per cent to 20 cents a share, from 18 cents a share, after passing the so-called “stress test” by the Federal Reserve.Amex shares are up more than 20 per cent this year, making it one of the top performing stocks in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. The shares fell 0.8 per cent to $57.73 in extended trading hours after the earnings report.Earlier this year, the company announced plans to repurchase as much as $4bn of its outstanding shares by the end of December and an additional $1bn in the first quarter of 2013. The company said on Wednesday that it had so far bought back $2bn of shares, Bloomberg reported.

As part of this organisation’s unstinting commitment to the games we are now applying strict Olympic governance conditions to the production of this article.For a start, all Olympic marketing rules will be vigorously applied and we will not let any free-riders or parasites hijack this column for their own purposes and to the detriment of our sponsors. As is well understood there can be no mention in this article of any products or businesses that have not paid through the nose to be here. Our sponsors have paid good money for the prominence they expect in this column and so as I sip my mouthwateringly refreshing Coke and type away on a computer purchased with my Visa card I am resolved not to let them down.Security staff are on high alert for guerrilla marketing campaigns that might undermine the spirit of this article. There was, for example, an attempt in the paragraph above to sneak in a reference to Pepsi but the word was caught by one of the 10,000 burly production editors hired to keep the word Pepsi out of this column. We have reassured our sponsors that the word Pepsi will not appear in this newspaper for the duration of the games and severe penalties await those who flout the rules.A series of specially created draconian laws has been enacted to protect the integrity of events and the person responsible for attempting to sneak in the reference is now under lock and key at the Olympic police station, where he is likely to be charged under the new criminal offence of mentioning the word Pepsi in a built-up Olympic area within the hours of August. Anyone caught doing so will have their hair dyed blond to be made to look like Julian Assange, and handed over to the Americans. We have promised our sponsors that this will be a festival of fun and freedom and we will not let anyone ruin it by speaking out of turn. Watch and learn Beijing; this is how things work in a free country. We are prepared to act ruthlessly. Extremism in defence of sponsors is no vice. Our security staff stand ready to frisk everyone attempting to read this article and sniffer dogs are on hand to detect any traces of MasterCard.We have faced criticism about some of our choices of sponsors. You will know of the concern that the presence of McDonald’s and Coke are hardly conducive to promoting healthy lifestyles. Well, we too have faced a similar backlash over the decision to site a large Spearmint Rhino lap dancing club in the middle of the newsroom, with people questioning how this sits with our commitment to gender equality even if it is popular with some of our City readers. We would like to stress that we remain absolutely unwavering in that commitment and that we have extracted a promise from Spearmint Rhino that at the end of each dance, every customer will be given a booklet on 50 great women, entitled You Don’t Have to be Hot to be Great, with biographies of Marie Curie, Margaret Thatcher, Abigail Adams, Amelia Earhart and Kim Kardashian.That said, readers should understand that this is a huge logistical exercise and we know there have been problems. The private outsourcing company hired to produce a number of the paragraphs has let us down badly, informing me only last night that they had not been able to recruit enough words to fill the available space. Several of their phrases did not show up for duty as expected, having been caught in severe traffic delays on the M4. As a result we are mobilising 3,000 troops currently on standby to deliver sentences at short notice. So fall in, you horrible shower.As part of the extensive security concerns we have stationed surface-to-air delete buttons around the author’s desk to prevent purple prose from flying into the middle section of this article and attacking the Banx cartoon. Some local residents have objected to the presence of these weapons on their roofs but we have assured them that it is part of the inclusivity agenda that is a core mission of this organisation.Sadly, some recommendations of the Notebook Delivery Authority are still to be implemented. The editor is still resisting my insistence on priority coffee lanes for me and my mates at the staff canteen. We know it was not universally popular but it is designed to ensure a smooth running of this Notebook and its omission is to be regretted. I only hope it doesn’t detract too much from your enjoyment of this article.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
234;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Monitise vows to double revenue again;Mobile payment provider forecasts a bright future;Monitise, which provides mobile payments technology for Visa and most of the UK high street banks, said on Tuesday that it was on track to double revenues for the third year in a row this year, and promised to double them again in 2013.Alastair Lukies, chief executive, said the company was forecasting revenues of £70m next year, as more consumers become accustomed to making payments over their mobile phones.Full-year 2012 revenues are expected to be £34m – nearly two and a half times the £14m reported last year.”Last year, when we said we were going to double revenues, people warned me to be careful,” Mr Lukies said. “But we have more than done that, and for me to say we are going to double again shows the confidence we have in this market.”Monitise, which is 10 per cent owned by Visa, is providing the technology behind the mobile payments services that Visa will be showcasing at the London Olympics later this month. The company also provides the back-end software for services ranging from mobile money transfers in Africa to mobile cinema ticket payments in India.It reported that it has nearly 16m people using its services and is now adding close to 1m customers every month.However, the 700-employee company is still lossmaking due to the heavy investment it has been making in technology, and on acquisitions – such as the purchase of Clairmail in the US last month. However, Mr Lukies said the company remained on track to reach break even in 2013.Monitise has benefited from a surge of interest over the past few years in mobile banking services. A number of large companies, such as Visa, Google and Telefónica, are currently vying to launch mobile wallet services. Analysts at Jupiter Research estimate that about $240bn of transactions were made over mobile devices in 2011 and that amount is expected to triple over the next five years.Shares in Monitise, which is listed on London’s Aim market were flat at 29p.FT CommentMonitise operates in one of the few areas of excitement in the UK technology sector at the moment. While many established technology companies are eking out single-digit growth rates, Monitise’s revenues have doubled and doubled and doubled again. For a lossmaking company, a market capitalisation of more than £300m may seem too steep – but it equates to 4.5 times next year’s sales, well below the 6-10 times sales that high-growth US tech stocks, such as Salesforce.com, traded on during their revenue-doubling phase. Backers such a Visa and tier-one banks also make Monitise seem less of high-risk bet. Unless, of course, Mr Lukies makes good a threat to take the company to Nasdaq instead.
235;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:30:29+0000;WTO rules against China on payment cards;;The World Trade Organisation has ruled that China discriminates against foreign electronic payment providers, handing the US its latest victory in a trade dispute over market access in the Asian nation.A panel of the global trade body said China was maintaining a monopoly for certain types – but not all – renminbi-denominated card transactions, in a manner that was inconsistent with WTO rules.China only allows one company – China UnionPay – to process domestic currency transactions and requires that all payment cards issued in the country bear its logo, limiting foreign providers such as Visa and MasterCard.Although the US did not prevail in every argument it made before the WTO panel, the ruling was being treated as a win by the Obama administration, which is seizing every opportunity to tout its tough stance on trade enforcement with voters.“Today’s win highlights that tackling unfair Chinese trade practices has been a priority of this president,” said Jay Carney, White House press secretary, as Mr Obama travelled to Cincinnati in the swing state of Ohio for his latest campaign rally. “This is another judgment in the US’s favour,” Mr Carney said.Last month, the WTO ruled in favour of the US in its challenge to antidumping and countervailing duties imposed by China on a certain kind of high-tech steel product manufactured mostly in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, the US challenged other duties imposed by China on US car exports, with the announcement coming just as Mr Obama embarked on a two-day bus tour through Ohio.The win on electronic payments may have less political impact than the cases directly related to manufacturing, which affect a number of key swing states. But Tim Reif, the general counsel at the office of the US trade representative, said it would still yield job gains of about 6,000 across the country.Mr Reif signalled that the Obama administration would continue to be as aggressive as possible in bringing trade cases against China.“Where China intends to use measures that discriminate against foreign providers, we will figure it out, we will do our homework, we will put the case together, we will bring it to the WTO and we will win, “ Mr Reif said on a conference call with reporters.China said it welcomed aspects of the WTO ruling but had reservations over others.Visa and MasterCard are among the US companies that stand to benefit the most if China overhauls its rules in response to the ruling, though this may take some time, especially since China now has the right to appeal.“We are hopeful that this ruling will pave the way for international payment companies to participate in the domestic payments marketplace in China,” said Will Valentine, a Visa spokesman.Jim Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, said: “Today’s news from the WTO clarifies the market situation and makes those opportunities for our company all the more interesting in this important region.”“If the WTO adopts these findings, they will require reform in the sector,” said Carolyn Gleason, head of the international trade group at McDermott Will & Emery, a law firm. Ms Gleason says there have been relatively few WTO cases challenging China’s practices in the services sector, so the ruling could embolden countries and business interests to seek greater access to China’s services market.
236;V;Visa Inc;2012-07-13T23:35:40Z;MasterCard and Visa in $7.25bn settlement;;Visa, MasterCard and leading US banks have announced a proposed $7.25bn settlement with retailers over allegations of fee fixing for credit and debit cards.The news on Friday afternoon sent Visa and MasterCard shares up more than 2 per cent in after-hours trading. Both companies have outperformed the broader stock market this year as investors anticipated a settlement of class action and individual retailer claims over card fees they pay to banks on each transaction.The settlement includes the Visa and MasterCard card networks and banks that issue cards such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo and Capital One.The $7.25bn settlement would consist of a payment of more than $6bn for alleged past damages to retailers and a temporary reduction in the level of interchange fees paid by merchants on Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions.The case dates to 2005 and was set for trial in September. The settlement was made on behalf of a class of about 7m merchants in the US, said Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, a law firm that revealed details of the settlement.Visa said its share of proposed settlement payments for both the class and individual claims would represent about $4.4bn. “We believe settling this case is in the best interests of all parties,” said Joseph Saunders, Visa chief executive.MasterCard said its share of the cash portion of the settlements will total $790m on a pre-tax basis. It will incur an additional $20m pre-tax charge for the second quarter after a $770m charge in the fourth quarter of 2011.“Although we have strong defences to all claims, a settlement avoids years of litigation and uncertainties that are inherent in such cases,” said Noah Hanft, general counsel for MasterCard. “We believe that today’s settlements should resolve all issues with the merchant community.”Peter Welch, a Republican member of the US House of Representatives who has led on card fee issues, said: “This proposed settlement does not solve the problem of excessive fees or the opaque business practices of these financial institutions, but it is a step in the right direction.”In after-hours trading on Friday shares in Visa were up 2.4 per cent at $127, while MasterCard was up 2.2 per cent at $439. Both have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 this year.Visa will pay its settlement out of an escrow account set up ahead of its public offering.
237;V;Visa Inc;2012-07-11T22:43:54Z;Facebook goes for gold in Olympic coverage;;Facebook is teaming up with broadcasters across the globe on coverage of the 2012 London Olympics, underscoring the powerful role that the internet and social media is playing in this year’s Games.The social networking site on Wednesday announced a partnership with Comcast’s NBCUniversal. The US broadcaster will post Olympics-related news, interactive polls, photos and other exclusive content to Facebook. The partnership does not include payments.Facebook is also collaborating on Olympics programming with other international broadcasters, including the BBC. The British broadcaster plans to live stream coverage of the Games on Facebook.The London Olympics is expected to be the most social and digital Games to date. While social media existed during past Olympics, audiences have flocked to Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites in large numbers in recent years to consume media and chat about current events. Facebook now has more than 900m users, compared to 100m during the last Summer Olympics in 2008.Broadcasters, the International Olympic Committee and marketers are incorporating several social elements into their Olympics plans in attempts to spur interest in the Games among younger viewers and capitalise on the chatter surrounding the event.The IOC is working with several social media outlets, including Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, the location-based social application, and Weibo, the Chinese social network. The official mascots for the games, Wenlock and Mandeville, have their own accounts on Facebook and Twitter.To squeeze the most out of their expensive Olympics sponsorships, marketers are preparing social extensions for their ad campaigns. Visa, for instance, is tapping Facebook and Twitter for its global marketing campaign to encourage fans to cheer for the athletes it sponsors.Broadcasters see social media as a viable channel to drive a bigger audience to tune into their traditional television coverage. The Facebook-NBC partnership will influence on-air coverage, for instance, with Facebook employees working with NBC producers to create programmes about the results, athletes and other stories.“This is a new generation of the Olympic fan, and we really want to reach them,” John Miller, head of NBC Sports Agency, said at a press event this month.But there are limits. NBC, which paid $1.18bn for the US media rights to the London Olympics, is live streaming every Olympic event on the web, or more than 3,500 programming hours, but will not broadcast live video of the Games to Facebook.
238;V;Visa Inc;2012-07-08T20:50:31Z;Rogge hits back over sponsorship criticism;;With less than three weeks to go until the opening ceremony for the London Olympics, Jacques Rogge’s comments on sponsorship by fast-food giant McDonald’s will reignite debate about how commercial the games have become.But the International Olympic Committee chief takes issue with the notion that on his watch they have become more so.“I would say no, the fundamentals have stayed the same,” says the 70-year-old Mr Rogge, IOC president for the past 11 years.In that time, IOC broadcasting and global sponsorship revenues have grown from $2.3bn to $4.9bn.Broadcast revenues for the four years up to and including the London Olympics are up 40 per cent on the previous four-year period to £3.9bn.Sponsorship revenues from 11 multinationals, including McDonald’s – whose 3,000 sq m restaurant in the Olympic park will seat 1,500 and serve up to 14,000 customers a day – General Electric, Dow Chemicals, Panasonic, Visa and Coca-Cola, have grown less steeply but have still brought in $957m since 2009.Mr Rogge’s point is that as an organisation the IOC has not gone out of its way to be more commercial, although he does note that it has divided up its European broadcast rights to bring in more money.But from his office at the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, the one-time surgeon who represented Belgium in the yachting events at three Olympics, insists the Games are no more or less commercial than when he took over in 2001. Uniquely among sports bodies, the IOC allows no advertising inside competition venues.“Our approach is not more commercial, the returns or the revenues we get have augmented,” he says, seeming to suggest that money has come to the IOC rather than that the IOC has raised it.However, asked if the IOC’s financial needs meant there had to be a trade-off with the Olympic movement’s values – respect, excellence and friendship, with a stress on taking care of one’s health and the environment – Mr Rogge said: “I admit that in some cases we had long discussions. It’s the same with Locog [the London organising committee].”But although IOC revenues may look healthy, he says, they need to be maintained and sponsorship is vital. Hosting the Games is a costly affair – both building the venues and putting on the show – and the present economic climate will strain future hosts. The IOC helps host cities with funds to put on the show but not with the cost of building the venues.London’s organisers, he says, can be praised for raising most of the event’s domestic sponsorship before the 2008 crash and for getting close to its ticket sales target.But Rome has pulled out of the 2020 race, and as for Madrid’s bid, “it is first a matter for Madrid to convince us that the bid is financially viable”.Mr Rogge says the IOC is providing $1.3bn to London in cash and value in kind. But he insists it is not the IOC’s responsibility to help fund the construction of venues and determine the legacy of hosting the games.However, London persuaded the IOC to let it host the games partly because of its legacy promises, and Mr Rogge says legacy is “more than ever” important to choosing who hosts the games, neutralising critics who see the games as a waste of money.“We’re not going to set up this very complicated, sophisticated operation for staging the Games just for two weeks of pleasure and fun and enthusiasm,” he says. “This has to leave a legacy for the city, the region and the country for generations to come …And the legacy must be sustainable. We do not want white elephants.”
239;V;Visa Inc;2012-06-25T20:04:47Z;Next national sport agony – tennis;;Barely 13 hours after England made their narrow but time-honoured exit from the European football championships, the next phase in the cycle of national sporting agony began when the tennis started at Wimbledon.The same outcome is confidently expected when Andy Murray is beaten some time in the next fortnight. There is a school of thought that this year, that might come sooner rather than later. But in the meantime, a small quantity of hope springs eternal. The Sun newspaper’s front-page headline, against a background of inconsolable England footballers, was “Anyone for tennis?”The first-day atmosphere at Wimbledon was subdued, but the reason was not immediately obvious. This is not a particularly footbally crowd so post-traumatic stress is an improbable explanation. The recession? Wimbledon seems immune.It could be the impending Olympics, the all-purpose explanation for anything that goes wrong in London this year. (It’s like the war: “Don’t you know there’s an Olympics on?”)Maybe it’s the weather. The air seemed heavy, brooding, as though everyone was just awaiting another downpour, or perhaps a thunderclap from David Nalbandian.Lightning nearly did strike again. Nalbandian, the one-time Wimbledon runner-up from Argentina, who was disqualified for kicking a line-judge at Queen’s Club last weekend, was the opening attraction on Court One. His malfeasance cost him his chance of being seeded here, and he immediately had to face the No. 8 seed, Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia.The crowd was too dozy to either boo or cheer him, but Nalbandian was in a state of barely suppressed rage with officialdom. Are they against you, he was asked. “I don’t know,” he said. “They never do mistakes in 15-all. All mistakes are in the deuce, the break points, very important moments.” He had just lost in straight sets, by the way.Nalbandian, a 30-year-old underachiever still raging against the dying of the light, was not the most famous casualty. That was Venus Williams, five times the champion but now struggling against the nasty autoimmune disease, Sjogren’s Syndrome. She was walloped by the little-known Russian Elena Vesnina, but refused to moan (“My opponent played well”), discuss her health (“It is what it is”) or contemplate surrender. She is desperate to play in the Olympics. Vulnerable, she seems more of a star.The No.6 men’s seed Tomas Berdych also went out but the big two men in action – the reigning monarch Novak Djokovic and the old king Roger Federer – won easily enough. In the opening days of the tournament it is necessary to look to the outside courts for the best shows.There was a corking match on Court 3 between John Isner, the 6ft 9in American famous for winning the set of the century – 70-68 – here two years ago. He was up against the Colombian Alejandro Falla. It was a glorious contrast in styles: Isner serves, at up to 138 mph, as though he is dropping blazing projectiles from the castle ramparts on to a besieging army. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have much of a Plan B. This match also went to five sets, but he lost the last one 7-5. He is probably still knackered from 2010.In one sense, the Olympics hung over the place. The tennis takes place here (where else?) and so, in two weeks’ time, the makeover will start to provide a “clean venue” to conform with Olympic rules. This normally means removing extraneous advertising to make way for the Games sponsors, but at Wimbledon the branding is far less intrusive than at the forthcoming extravaganza.One remaining job is to fix the cash machines so they take nothing but Visa, who are among the Olympic sponsors and are determined to make sure everyone knows it. Now that’s intrusive.
240;V;Visa Inc;2012-06-13T18:02:01Z;Companies vent anger at Olympic gag;;"Ministers are under growing pressure from companies, frustrated that they are unable to “shout” about their involvement in creating this summer’s Olympics.They want the government to relax strict rules drawn up by the International Olympic Committee to protect the official sponsors.All businesses that won work on the 2012 games had to sign a “no marketing rights protocol”, banning them from issuing press releases, running advertising or any marketing or public relations campaigns publicising their link to the event. It also prevents them from using Olympic logos.Business leaders have called on ministers to override such “over-protective” measures.Arup, a London-based engineering and construction group that designed the Sydney Opera House, has said the protocol puts innovation and growth at risk.Tom Foulkes, the company’s head of marketing, said Arup was unable to talk about the various projects it had built at the Olympic Park because of the protocol. “This is a very strange world given the innovations that have been made and the great work that has been done,” he said. “This protocol puts UK plc at risk.”Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said companies should be able to “shout from the rooftops” about their hand in delivering the games.He said that under the protocol, some restrictions would remain in place even after the games. “This puts a lot of companies in a pretty difficult position,” he said.Suppliers cannot create games-related job titles such as “2012 Unit” or “Olympic Group”. They can mention Olympic bodies only on client lists where at least nine other clients are mentioned.The agreement was drawn up by the IOC to protect companies – including British Airways, Thames Water, McDonald's, Visa and Deloitte – that have paid more than £1bn towards the games.But critics are reminding ministers of David Cameron’s pledge that the Olympics will deliver a “lasting economic legacy that will benefit the whole country”.Pierre Williams, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, castigated Locog (the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) for a “wasted opportunity”, “petty officiousness” and for having been “absurdly over-protective” of its corporate sponsors.“In its almost paranoid attempts to protect the Olympic brand and its corporate sponsors, it has largely destroyed the goodwill that was there for the taking from businesses supplying the games,” he said.●STL Communications Oxfordshire-based STL Communications has been contracted to supply telephone systems and handsets that will be used to co-ordinate the opening and closing ceremonies

●Arup The UK engineering services group has been involved in several schemes within the Olympic Village. It also designed the “water cube” aquatics centre for the 2008 Beijing Olympics●Make Architects The firm won the tender to design the handball arena in the Olympic Park. After the games, the venue will be converted into a multi-use arenaChuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the Olympics were a “fantastic opportunity” to showcase the best of British business to the world. He called on ministers to explore what could be done “to give due attention” to that companies that had delivered the games.Whitehall officials admitted there had been discussions on how to relax the protocol, but said lawyers had given warning that it would be too difficult. “If we allow companies who have done some work on it to advertise that, it devalues the sponsorship and also the Olympics brand,” said one official.Mark Prisk, the enterprise minister, said that construction groups had “rightly” taken the issue up with the business department. “I think I can understand their frustrations,” he said. “I also understand why Locog has the rules they do.”The culture department said Locog had developed a “detailed protocol” allowing companies to refer to their contracts but only in some limited ways.“Businesses are allowed to talk about the facts; they just can’t proactively market in a way that creates an association with the games, which our sponsors have paid for,” said a Locog spokesperson.Sir John Armitt, the chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority, which was in charge of building the Olympic Park, urged businesses to “use their imagination” to report their involvement in the games.“You don’t develop business by taking adverts. You develop your business by knocking on doors and making presentations and talking to people – they have not been prevented from doing that,” he said.Sir John said most of the restrictions would be lifted after this year, when domestic sponsors’ rights expired."
241;V;Visa Inc;2012-06-13T00:08:52Z;Credit data breach may be worse than thought;;Global Payments, the payment processor, said that a breach of its systems reported earlier this year may have compromised more information than previously thought.The company, which processes transactions involving Visa, MasterCard and American Express, said on Tuesday that its ongoing investigation had revealed that hackers may have gained access to servers containing personal information from its merchant customers.“It is unclear whether the intruders looked at or took any personal information from the company’s systems,” it said.When Global Payments first revealed the breach in March, the company said that the thieves may have accessed card numbers, but not cardholders’ names, addresses and social security numbers.Global Payments said that its investigation has established that the actual card numbers that may have been stolen did not exceed its previous estimate of 1.5m.Company officials were not immediately available to elaborate on what kind of personal information may have been compromised.Global Payments works behind the scenes in card transactions, serving as the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.The breach has prompted Visa and MasterCard to remove the company from a list of data processors that meet industry standards for security.In the coming days, Global Payments will notify individuals whose personal information may have been hacked and provide them with identity protection insurance at no cost.Paul Garcia, the chairman and chief executive of Global Payments, said: “We sincerely apologise for this incident and are working diligently to conclude our investigation. We are committed to fully resolve any issues arising from this matter and we, of course, continue to provide uninterrupted transaction processing for our customers worldwide.”The company plans to provide information on how much the breach will cost no later than its July 26 earnings call.The share price of Global Payments has fallen about 20 per cent since news of the breach surfaced.

It is an attractive idea that big brands are keen to be identified with.“Olympic sponsor brands start with a huge advantage,” says Peter Walshe, Global BrandZ director at Millward Brown. “Sponsorship acts both as a flag waver for the brand in some very important areas, as well as a defence against some key competitors.”Five top 100 brands, Coca-Cola, GE, McDonald’s, Panasonic, Samsung and Visa, are members of the International Olympic Committee’s The Olympic Partner (TOP) programme. Meanwhile the London 2012 Olympic Partners include Top 100 Adidas, BMW and BP, and Cisco is an official supporter.BrandZ compared the TOP sponsors with their closest competitors. These were Coca Cola with Pepsi, GE with Siemens, McDonald’s with KFC, Samsung with Sony and Visa with MasterCard. They scored 118 on leadership, against 105 for their competitors, 113 on brand desire (104) and 108 for corporate reputation (101).“They are powerful brands that are leaders in their field,” says Mr Walshe, “There is no evidence that they are stronger and more powerful simply because of the Olympics. The bigger, more successful brands tend to be the sponsors.”It is no coincidence sports sponsorship is dominated by large global brands as multinational companies need to extend the reach of their products.“Global sporting and other events are ideal platforms for businesses to move from national to global brand identities and become familiar around the world,” says Terry Tyrrell, worldwide chairman for The Brand Union, a global branding agency within the WPP Group. “These platforms are good value when you compare them with standalone global corporate advertising campaigns. If a big organisation is not building its reputation on a global basis, it will be ‘gobbled up’ by 2030.”However, he warns clients to be wary of associating themselves with sports tarnished by bribery, corruption, match-fixing and bad behaviour. This is why aligning with the Olympic philosophy is a great opportunity.The BrandZ research shows that discontinuing TOP sponsorship would give competitors an opportunity to replace them. “There can be almost as much value in stopping someone else doing it as in you doing it yourself,” says Mr Walshe.He adds: “Being in possession of a great property, and the leadership stance that confers on you, gives you powerful support.”While Beijing was an opportunity for brands to establish themselves in a growing market, London is a mature market and is a popular tourist destination.Heather Hancock, lead 2012 partner at Deloitte, a London 2012 Official Supporter, she believes Olympic sponsorship has reached a turning point.“Big, heavy overt marketing-style brand activity and ‘splash’ advertising is
giving way to more subtle values-led activity,” she says. She cites the example of BP, oil and gas and also sustainability and carbon offset partner, positioning itself to being a new generation energy company rather than just linked to fossil fuels.Steve Martin, chief executive of M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, a communications agency, says sponsors are linking culture and the “look and feel” of London. “Creatively, London is a rich territory,” he says. “It is globally renowned with a unique personality that travels very well, and brands can attach themselves to that.”An example is Coca Cola’s “Anywhere in the World” 2012 song and its Beatbox interactive musical pavilion in the Olympic park. “We aim to bring teenagers closer to the Olympic Games, and to sport in general, by harnessing their passion for music and drawing inspiration from London’s musical heritage,” says the company.One problem for the TOP sponsors is that they have to commit several games ahead, without knowing which cities and national markets they will be supporting. Matt Rogan, managing director of Two Circles, a sports business consultancy, and a board director at the European Sponsorship Association, says “second world”’ nations are increasingly interested in hosting such events and the Olympic movement is aspiring to drive long-term societal benefit.This may be very worthy, but Mr Rogan can see a possible tension with sponsors who want to be in first world nations or at least in very fast-growing emerging markets.“We should not underestimate the reach and power of sport to engage with large audiences, both consumer and business,” adds Mr Walshe. “If you can link your brand positively, without interrupting the audience’s enjoyment, and actually be seen as helping to deliver it, then the credit that comes to you as a brand is absolutely enormous. You are getting to people with something that is highly enjoyable and engaging, rousing those emotions like few other things can do.”"

It zigzagged before closing up 0.6 per cent at $38.23. Its underwriters – a group of 33 banks led by Morgan Stanley – stepped in when the shares fell back to their offer price and bought stock to keep the price from dipping further, according to a person familiar with the intervention.Nasdaq held a call after the close to hear grievances from traders who said the glitches – including disconnections, delayed confirmations and stale quotes – resulted in improper trades. The Securities and Exchange Commission said it would review the incident.The US’s third-biggest initial public offering raised $16bn, trailing only Visa’s IPO in 2009 and a General Motors‘s in 2010.Facebook’s underwriters, a group of 33 investment banks led by Morgan Stanley, stepped in when the shares fell close to their original offer price and bought shares to keep the price from dipping further, according to a person familiar with events.Analysts at Morningstar said the company’s record $104bn valuation, set against the backdrop of a weak stock market and setbacks for its advertising business, may account for the lacklustre debut.Several other highly anticipated technology IPOs rose much higher on their opening days, including 109 per cent and 31 per cent gains, respectively, for shareholders at LinkedIn and Groupon.Some will see the modest rise as a coup for Facebook, leaving the company more money at the expense of day-traders and justifying its aggressive pricing at the very top of its indicative range.“They found the perfect equilibrium point for the offering,” said Manuel Henriquez, a Facebook investor. “Taking the money off the table gives them a lot of dry powder to go pursue acquisitions and allow the stock to trade a lot cleaner in the future.”The company has demonstrated to Wall Street throughout the IPO process that it will maintain as much control over its affairs as possible.Mr Zuckerberg, in trademark hoodie and jeans, rang the opening Nasdaq bell remotely from Facebook headquarters. Allowing no reporters access to the event, Facebook controlled a video feed showing the chief executive flanked by Sheryl Sandberg, his chief operating officer, and surrounded by executives. Thousands of employees watched and clapped as he pushed the button, then erupted into cheers.The first day of trading marks the official turning point in Facebook’s eight-year history from private start-up ruled by “hackers,” to massively valued public company, ruled by one chief “hacker.”Mr Zuckerberg maintains more than 50 per cent of the company’s voting rights, ensuring his long term control. By the close of trading, his stake in the company was valued at $19.2bn. He personally sold $1.1bn of shares in the IPO, which he said would be mainly used to pay taxes.In a “hacker” sign of support for their leader, Facebook engineers rigged the Nasdaq button in the days before the IPO launch. When Mr Zuckerberg pushed it Friday morning to symbolise the start of trading, it sent an automatic post to his Facebook profile page: “Mark Zuckerberg has listed a company on Nasdaq.”Mr Zuckerberg was among the first to “Like” the post.Separately, in a sign of the battles Facebook will face as a public company, lawyers filed an updated lawsuit seeking $15bn damages over allegations Facebook improperly tracked the internet use of members.Additional reporting by Jane Croft in London
244;V;Visa Inc;2012-05-17T20:37:28Z;Facebook valued at $104bn in IPO;Valuation of $104bn at top of the range;Facebook set the share price for its initial public offering at $38, giving the social-networking company a $104bn valuation and propelling it into the ranks of the top 25 US public companies.Mark Zuckerberg, the 28-year-old founder and chief executive, raised $1.1bn, leaving him with a stake valued at $19bn, firmly establishing him as one of the richest men in the world.Investor appetite for the stock was so high in the days leading up to its market debut, especially among individual investors, the price range, valuation and number of shares for sale were all raised.“Many people are not buying Facebook because it’s an investment, but because they feel like they want to own a piece of history,” said Mona DeFrawi, chief executive of Equidity, an IPO consultancy.The demand surpassed most analysts’ expectations in spite of growing criticism of the social network’s mobile strategy and advertising business. General Motors this week withdrew from Facebook’s paid advertising platform.The company’s $104bn valuation has raised doubts over whether the company will develop enough new and effective advertising tools or other revenue streams to match investor expectations.“There’s an awful lot of optimism built into this valuation,” said Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. “The company really has to perform in order to avoid the stock price declining due to these lofty expectations.”A pop on first day of trading was likely, Prof Ritter said. According to his analysis of IPOs since 2001, when a company’s final price is set higher than the originally filed price range, the first day price jumps 30 per cent, on average. Facebook’s original price range was $28-$35, which was raised to $34-$38 this week.The company raised $16bn, making it the third-largest public offering in the US, behind those of Visa in 2009 and General Motors in 2010. If investors and underwriters sell an additional “overallotment” of 63m Facebook shares in the coming weeks, as is expected, the IPO could surpass Visa’s.Fellow internet group Google’s IPO was one-tenth the size of Facebook’s.What is Facebook really worth? This calculator illustrates how variations in key assumptions can change the potential market value and share price of an IPO.The deal will generate huge returns for many venture capital firms, which acquired shares at a fraction of the IPO price, as well as create other billionaires besides Mr Zuckerberg. Dustin Moskovitz, an early employee, sold no shares, but will now have a stake of $5bn.The largest share sales were by Accel Partners, the venture capital firm headed by Jim Breyer, one of the company’s earliest backers. The firm raised $1.8bn in the offering and has a remaining stake of $300m plus a large A class (non-voting) stake worth $5bn based on the offer price. It paid $20m to acquire its stake, according to figures compiled by PrivCo, a boutique research firm.DST Global, run by Russian investor Yuri Milner, raised $1.7bn, and Peter Thiel, another of Mr Zuckerberg’s early confidantes, raised $638m.
245;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa reveals DoJ demand as card groups shine;Profits driven by shift away from cash;Visa shares fell as much as 3 per cent as it disclosed that it had received a civil investigative demand – the official request for information that is the first indication that a formal investigation is under way – from the US Department of Justice in March.The disclosure came as Visa and MasterCard, two of the world’s largest payment processing networks, reported strong quarterly profits driven by a global shift by consumers from cash to card payments.Programmes to encourage credit card usage over debit cards helped lift Visa’s second quarter operating revenues 14.8 per cent to $2.6bn compared with the same period a year ago.Adjusted net income jumped 23 per cent to $1.1bn, with earnings of $1.60 a share coming in 10 cents better than analysts had forecast.Speaking to investors on a conference call, Joseph Saunders, chief executive, raised full-year profit guidance and said earnings per share growth could be as high as the “low-twenties”, up from previous guidance in the “high-teens”.“Our strong financial performance this quarter was fuelled by continued growth of US credit products, strong cross-border spending and expansion of Visa’s core business in international markets,” said Mr Saunders.Regarding the justice department letter, Darrin Peller, analyst at Barclays, said the intermediary companies who process payments between retailers and the card companies may have lobbied the government to look into Visa’s pricing adjustments. Visa has made changes to its payments business in response to new regulations that are designed to increase competition among providers.Mr Saunders said that the company had received other requests of this nature before and that the process may take up to a year to resolve.“My impression is Visa will get through this. They’ve been through multiple reviews before and have come out extraordinarily strong or well-positioned before,” Mr Peller said.Earlier on Wednesday, MasterCard said that its net income rose to $682m, or $5.36 a share, in the first three months of the year from $562m, or $4.29 a share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts’ expectations.“We had a good start to the year with solid first-quarter results driven by an increase in processed transactions, the highest quarterly growth rate since our initial public offering, as well as positive volume growth in all regions as consumers continue to adopt electronic payments,” said Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s president and chief executive.Net revenues rose to $1.76bn from $1.5bn in the year-over-year quarter, but officials warned that growth would probably slow as the year progressed.The extra day from a leap year and the US tax season helped results in the first three months, while growth was strong last year, making for tough comparisons as the year progresses.Company officials nonetheless reiterated guidance that MasterCard could achieve a compound annual growth rate of 12 to 14 per cent in net revenues and at least 20 per cent in earnings per share this year and next.Worldwide purchase volume during the first quarter was up 17 per cent on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2011 to $629bn. Processed transactions jumped 29 per cent in the quarter to 7.7bn and MasterCard branded cards issued reached 1.8bn.The rise in cardholder spending was partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives. Total operating expenses were $758m, up 14 per cent from the first quarter of 2011.Gross dollar volume, a combination of purchases and cash withdrawals on cards, grew by 19 per cent in Europe in spite of the problems in the region. Growth rates exceeded 20 per cent in the Asia Pacific, central Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer, said MasterCard had gained market share in the US versus Visa, its larger rival, following the changes to regulations on transaction fees and processing.Shares of MasterCard dropped 1 per cent to $451.45 during the regular session.
246;V;Visa Inc;2012-05-02T18:06:30Z;MasterCard: plastic progress;People are using their cards more but keep an eye on issuers’ margins;You’re in a rush, but pop into a corner store for a can of Coke. The exact change is in your hand. Is there anything more frustrating than that person in front of you buying a loaf of bread with plastic? Well, get used to it. MasterCard’s first-quarter results on Wednesday showed a 29 per cent rise in global processed transactions versus last year – the fastest rate of growth since the company went public in 2006.Sometimes it is easy to complicate a story.This is particularly true in electronic commerce with opaque financial arrangements between customers, retailers, banks and the big networks such as MasterCard and Visa. Then there are new regulations such as those that recently capped transaction fees. But the simple story here is that people are using credit and debit cards more. In the US, for example, three-quarters of spending in the early 1990s was via cash or cheques – today it is about a third. More exciting is the developing world. Across all of MasterCard’s credit, charge and debit programmes, gross dollar volumes grew by almost a quarter in Latin America in local currency terms compared with a year ago, and by even more in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Globally, 85 per cent of transactions are still by cash or cheque. The death of cash is always exaggerated, but an $80tn untapped market is exciting over any timeframe.The trouble with simple stories, however, is that they tend to be reflected in share prices. This is the case with MasterCard and Visa, both trading on about 20 times forward earnings after outperforming the S&P 500 index by more than 75 per cent over the past five years. Such racy multiples would normally be worth it given the growth potential. But margins at both companies are at record highs. Any investor who thinks margins could normalise should not reach for their wallets.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
247;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Fresh blow for Global Payments;;Global Payments, a processor of debit and credit card transactions that reported a breach in March, said late on Tuesday that “certain card associations” had removed the company from their lists of processors that meet industry standards for security.The company processes transactions involving brands including Visa, MasterCard and American Express.Global Payments reiterated assurances it gave in March that no more than 1.5m card numbers were at risk in the breach and that it was confined to its processing system in North America.Days after the breach was revealed, Visa, the world’s largest payment processor, removed Global Payments from a list it publishes for merchants of data processors that meet industry standards for security.A spokesperson for Global Payments was not available to comment on card associations that may have taken similar steps.Global Payments said it hoped to regain its security status following an investigation into the breach.“We anticipate that we will be reinstated to those lists at the conclusion of the revalidation and any required remediation,” the company said on a website it set up to provide information on the security breach.In April, MasterCard had said it would consider what steps to take based on the findings of an external and independent investigation.Losing the seal of approval on security from Visa or other brands does not preclude Global Payments from processing transactions.Global Payments is the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to the Nilson Report, a payment industry newsletter. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.Global Payments said it continued to work with third parties, regulators and lawmakers to minimise the impact of the breach on cardholders.On Tuesday, Global Payments shares rose 1.1 per cent to $46.92.
248;V;Visa Inc;2012-05-01T18:41:33Z;Visa delays overshadow passport queues;;"Ministers have tried to allay criticism from business and travel leaders about the painfully slow processing of visas by deploying 150 extra consular staff to China over the busy summer period.The Heathrow queues fiasco prompted the CBI employers’ group and tour operators to put pressure on the government to act on the issue of visas, the other major bugbear affecting travellers trying to come to the UK.The deployment – formalised by Damian Green, immigration minister, during a trip to China last month – is an attempt to lessen delays after an 80 per cent increase in demand for visas from Chinese tourists between 2009 and 2011.More than 200,000 visitor visas were issued to Chinese nationals last year.Visitors from China and Brazil are having to take several days off work to get UK visas processed, according to David Scowsill of the World Travel and Tourism Council.The visa issue was “a much bigger deterrent” for visitors than passport queues, he said, adding that Brazilians “have to have a great determination to come to the UK”.The US, which has also infuriated visitors with its draconian visa policy, took action in January when Barack Obama signed executive orders to expedite visas from Brazil and China by recruiting more consular staff.“President Obama now gets it; he understands the economic benefits,” Mr Scowsill said.Business leaders have long argued that the UK economy is losing out to Europe in attracting visitors because of visa policy.Neil Carberry of the CBI said the “critical frustration” facing members was long processing times for prominent individuals.“One of the things we get a lot of feedback on is having to wait a long time, or even not getting a visa quickly enough, for a key figure to attend a particular meeting,” Mr Carberry said.For non-European passport holders already in the UK but trying to extend their visas or apply for indefinite leave to remain, the situation is no better.Some lawyers are so fed up with the UK Border Agency’s backed-up booking system that they have taken to lobbying Mr Green’s private office directly.Others reported that their clients faced delays of one-and-a-half months even to get an appointment at the UK Border Agency’s “super premium” service which costs £6,000.Kamal Rahman, immigration partner at Mishcon de Reya, a law firm specialising in wealthy clients, said: “This is stopping clients who are senior investors, who want to travel freely. Captains of industry are not going to sit and wait.”The UK visa processing system is regarded by tour operators as “the most problematic” in the world.Visas to the UK are costlier, more complicated and take longer to process than the Schengen visa, which grants access to 26 European countries. The UK visa application form is nine pages long, compared with three for Schengen, and must be completed in English.It costs £78, which is non-refundable, and requires photographs and fingerprints. A decision on the application can take up to three weeks, according to the European Tour Operators Association.One Mumbai tour operator last year advertised the benefits of taking a trip to Europe “without London”, emphasising the benefit of not having to apply for a UK visa.According to Tom Jenkins, executive director of the European Tour Operators Association, a three-hour wait at Heathrow passport control is minor compared to having to set aside working days at a British consulate.“The visa issue represents a huge malevolent block on people coming to the country,” Mr Jenkins said."
249;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Governments embrace e-payments;;Governments around the world are increasingly using electronic platforms to collect taxes, procure goods and services and other key transactions as part of a global shift away from cash payments, a study released this week showed.Advancements in technology and heightened security measures to bolster the public’s trust in transferring funds through the Internet are driving adoption, the research conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the research arm of the publisher of the Economist magazine, and sponsored by Visa, showed.Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payments processors, stand to gain from the move away from cash and both are aggressively pursuing opportunities to promote the acceptance of e-payments, particularly in emerging countries where large parts of the population may not be using banks at all.“Submitting a tax return online, swiping an electronic card to pay for a bus journey or even, perhaps, receiving government health and/or social benefits directly in a bank account are now a way of life in many countries,” the study said. “The ability of governments to offer these services via electronic platforms benefits all parties in the form of reduced costs and increased access.”Of the 62 countries studied, not surprisingly, wealthy and developed countries have the most widespread adoption of e-payments. The US, UK and Norway were the top performers in the study, while Nigeria, Uganda and Ukraine were the bottom three.Elizabeth Buse, president of Visa’s business in the Asia Pacific countries, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa, said that government adoption of e-payments “engenders trust,” paving the way for other types of electronic transactions.“In developed countries it is simply more convenient to make or receive a payment electronically, but it emerging countries it can drive economic development,” Ms Buse said.Advocates argue that e-payments reduce costs and corruption by increasing transparency and that they help to bring citizens into the mainstream economy.With more than 5bn mobile phone users worldwide, the study predicts that mobile payments will “boom” in the coming years. Visa is hoping that mobile devices will be the link to legions of “un-banked” people in developing areas where mobile phones may be more ubiquitous than bank accounts.“There are places where we have made very significant progress to electronify the economy and there are places where we still have lots of room for additional focus and investment,” said Bill Sheedy, president of Visa’s business for the Americas. “It is a huge business opportunity.”Among the most common services now available, more than 90 per cent of the countries researched have a system in place to enable citizens to calculate and file their income taxes electronically, while eight-six percent have an electronic system that helps governments collect sales tax from businesses. Nearly 84 per cent have electronic or automated systems for vehicle-related costs such as tolls and fines.The development of e-payment facilities for obtaining or paying for identification cards, requesting unemployment and other welfare benefits and the disbursement of loans to businesses fared lower.
250;V;Visa Inc;2012-04-19T22:36:56Z;Wall Street edges lower on jobs data;;Ebay shares soared to a new 52-week high as the company’s ambitious plans to lead the mobile payments race encouraged investors, but another weak jobs report added to Wall Street’s woes on Thursday.Elsewhere, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley said first-quarter profit was boosted by rebounds in their respective trading divisions.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 1,376.92 in the week’s second-to-last trading session.The benchmark US index is up about 1 per cent for the week but continues to trade below its cyclical high of nearly 1,420 achieved on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 0.5 per cent lower to 12,964.10, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.8 per cent lower at 3,007.56.Shares in eBay rose 13.2 per cent to $40.62 as the online marketplace provider said it had moved to “define the future of money” through its payment arm, PayPal.The unit launched several new initiatives in the first quarter that it plans to test throughout the year to compete against the likes of Visa, American Express and Google as companies race to create “mobile wallet” offerings for consumers.“PayPal continues to gain market share and drive profitable growth, and in the first quarter benefited from a higher take rate and accelerating growth in number of payments,” said Colin Sebastian, analyst at Baird.Revenues at PayPal jumped 32 per cent to $1.3bn as eBay posted overall sales of $3.3bn – beating analyst expectations of $3.15bn – and up 29 per cent over the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share rose 18 per cent to 55 cents on a diluted basis.“We downgraded eBay shares [to ‘hold’] on March 18 [and set a price target of] $38 as we found the risk-reward outlook less compelling,” said Mark Mahaney, analyst at Citigroup. “First-quarter results appear to have made our call premature, which is another way of saying wrong.”Meanwhile, Michael Graham, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said he was raising his forecast of earnings-per-share growth for 2012 to 18 per cent and for 2013 to 15 per cent.Mr Graham set a price target of $41 and issued a “hold” rating for eBay shares, which are up more than 30 per cent over the past year.Also on Thursday, the US labour department said first-time jobless claims fell by 2,000 to 386,000 in the week to April 14. Despite the drop, the figure came in above expectations of 365,000 new claims.Last week’s figures were revised upwards and, coupled with the March jobs report, recent employment data has suggested to market watchers that labour market recovery is increasingly unsteady.“The muddy waters surrounding the employment picture darkened after jobless claims fell, albeit from an upwardly revised prior reading,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economist at Miller Tabak.Morgan Stanley shares rose 2.3 per cent to $18.07 as the US bank said first-quarter earnings came in ahead of analysts’ expectations due to strong fixed income sales and trading.Net revenues climbed to $8.9bn as the bank reported earnings of 71 cents a share, beating estimates of 45 cents expected by analysts.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Great trading results, OK banking and wealth management numbers and solid expense trends all combined to produce the best quarter we have seen at Morgan Stanley in a long time.”Despite the results, Mr Schorr kept his price target at $20 and a rating of “hold” for the shares in the bank.Shares in Bank of America, which have risen more than 60 per cent in the year to date, lost 1.8 per cent to $8.77.Excluding one-offs relating to its debt valuation, Bank of America reported first-quarter revenues of $27.3bn, down to 2.5 per cent from the same period last year. Earnings declined from 17 cents to 3 cents a share.The bank, which passed the Federal Reserve’s stress test last month but declined to return capital to shareholders, said core profits improved in the first quarter on gains from its sales and trading unit.But the bank’s mortgages unit failed to turn a profit, highlighting the problem’s that continue to persist since it took over Countrywide in 2008.Keith Horowitz, analyst at Citigroup, said he thought the results would have a positive effect on shares in the near term.“We would expect the stock to outperform today given recent weakness and relatively better core results and capital outlook,” he added, while keeping his “hold” rating and a price target of $8.50 for the company’s shares.The New York Times Company, publisher of the national paper, rose more than 4 per cent to $6.38 after its first-quarter earnings came in ahead of expectations while shares are still down almost 30 per cent over the past year.The group said that paid digital subscriptions totalled 472,000 as of March 18, up 16.2 per cent from the end of the last quarter.Microsoft shares climbed almost 3 per cent to $31.90 in after-hours trading after the computer giant released first-quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations on revenue and earnings.Thursday also saw the most successful market debut in almost a year, as shares in Splunk, a search software company, more than doubled on their first day of trading, closing at $35.48, after their $17 initial public offering. That was the best first day “pop” since the market debut of LinkedIn in May last year, according to Dealogic.

That compares with analysts’ estimates of $1.01 per share, according to Bloomberg.Consolidated revenues, net of interest expense, rose 8 per cent to $7.6bn in the first quarter from $7bn in first quarter of 2011.“Spending on the American Express network rose 12 per cent, remaining strong throughout the quarter, both in the US and internationally,” said Kenneth Chenault, the company’s chairman and chief executive. “Credit quality continues to be among the best we have ever experienced, and our lending portfolio continued to grow at moderate levels.”Billed business to Amex cards totalled $211bn in the quarter, up 12 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2011, helped by the extra day a leap year added in February. Average card member spending rose 10 per cent to $3,772 in the first quarter from $3,438 in the previous quarter.In spite of economic stress in the region, billed business in Europe rose 6 per cent in the first quarter in line with the “stabilising” trend seen in the fourth quarter, said Dan Henry, chief financial officer.Consolidated expenses totalled $5.4bn, up 4 per cent from $5.2bn a year ago as higher salaries, employee benefits and other operating costs were partially offset by lower marketing, promotion and expenses related to card member rewards.In the year ago period, consolidated settlement payments from MasterCard and Visa, the payment processors, totalling $220m related to a lawsuit over anticompetitive behaviour reduced consolidated expenses.A pledge by the company to contain expenses has raised concerns about its ability to stave off growing competition. “Our concern is that expenses typically do not go down or stay flat when competition is going up,” said Jason Arnold, an analyst at RBC Securities. “The concern for the year ahead is: Will [American Express] be able to control expenses and how well, if indeed the competition is heating up?”In particular, Mr Arnold noted efforts by JPMorgan and Citigroup to attract American Express’ customer base of affluent individuals and businesses.To expand to other types of customers, American Express itself has been investing in digital technology focused on the so-called alternative payments sector, which includes online and mobile payment platforms.American Express earlier this year boosted its quarterly dividend by 11 per cent to 20 cents a share, from 18 cents a share after passing the so-called “stress test” by the Federal Reserve. The company plans to repurchase as much as $4bn of its outstanding shares this year and an additional $1bn in the first quarter of 2013.Mr Henry said that the company would also consider strategic acquisitions. “If we see strategic acquisitions, we will do them,” he said. “If not, we will use capital to do share repurchases.”American Express shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $57.80 in after-market trading.

For just over a year now, he has been sticking to Loeb’s guidance to put all his eggs in one basket – and then watch the basket.I have been executing trades on his behalf through a dedicated account for which he is listed as beneficiary and which he will take over when he turns 18. So, a year into this venture, what have been the early lessons from George’s “learning account”?I opened the account in March 2011 with £2,000 of his own savings. In April, George chose his first stock – he put all of the money into Office2Office, the business services company. This allowed him to benefit from its generous dividend, receiving a cash payout of £110 in May. He then sold in mid-August for £2,232, making a total profit of £342 on the trade.Two weeks later, with a balance of about £2,300, he chose to invest in Burberry. George saw the luxury apparel retailer was benefiting from an uptrend following its August 2011 decline. It was a volatile time, so we only held the shares for three weeks, selling in September 2011, for £2,480. His profit from this trade came to £190, taking the balance to a total of about £2,500.He then sat on his cash for a while, pondering what, if anything, to invest in. In early December, a good opportunity presented itself in the form of Monitise, the Visa-linked mobile payment technology firm, so George invested the whole £2,500. This holding was sold about three months later, for £2,850, bringing another £350 in profit.That brought us full circle, back to March. Just a year after he first ventured into the stock market, his beneficiary account balance has risen from £2,000 to £2,850, a whopping 42 per cent increase.Admittedly, this is not exactly newly found wealth. It would not be enough to cover even a term of his tuition fees. If, however, he manages, to get the same return on investment on his current capital, he could double the original £2,000, to £4,047, next year.More importantly, he has learnt some good lessons along the way.First of all, he will have discovered that, unlike spending, investing can make his funds grow in a way that allows him to keep his capital intact and still have enough to spend on the latest computer games, or whatever else teenagers buy.Second, he will have realised that there is no need to be invested all the time. It is better to dip into the market when things are likely to go the right way.Third, he will have learnt the importance of proper research, of planning a trade, and of sticking to a plan. This plan means engaging in one trade at a time and watching it closely; sell when the target is hit (even if you are tempted to hold on in case the price rises further); or sell promptly if the trade goes against your expectation and forget the loss.With this style of short-term trading, you need to focus on the coming days, weeks or months: when markets are volatile, one cannot say which way things will go. These are the lessons of legendary traders Loeb, Jesse Livermore and Curtis Faith.Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments.

253;V;Visa Inc;2012-04-03T03:17:23Z;Concerns remain over data security standards;;The data security breach at Global Payments, an Atlanta-based credit card payment processor, has highlighted once again that those companies involved in the complex payment processing chain are among the prime targets for hackers and cyber criminals.Global Payments said the breach involved the “export” of “Track 2” data related to about 1.5m Visa and MasterCard-branded cards, but insisted that cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers were not compromised.Global Payments is the latest in a long list of companies including Citigroup, Epsilon Data Management, Heartland Payment Systems and CardSystems Solutions that have suffered data breaches in recent years affecting hundreds of millions of consumers and causing considerable expense for card issuers, banks and others in the payments chain. The Heartland Payment Systems attack alone in 2009 is estimated to have compromised up to 130m credit and debit cards.Despite detailed investigations, the perpetrators of these attacks are often never caught. However the arrest and subsequent conviction of Albert Gonzalez, a former law enforcement informant, who pleaded guilty in 2010 to the Heartland attack, provided a rare insight into the shadowy world of cybercrime.During a five-year cybercrime spree Gonzalez, who was given a 20-year prison sentence for the Heartland attack, is believed to have netted almost $3m which he used to buy an apartment in Miami, a car, Rolex watches and a Tiffany ring for his girlfriend. After his arrest, federal investigators found more than $1m in cash buried in a barrel in his parent’s backyard in Florida. Meanwhile, his crimes cost companies, banks and insurers almost $200m, according to the justice department.So far, Global Payments has made few details about the breach available and has yet to quantify the costs that it might incur though it has acknowledged that it is likely to record a charge once all the costs have been tallied.It may, however, have already suffered what some security experts term a “reputational hit” to its brand. Visa’s decision to drop the company from its registry of providers that meet the PCI credit card processing security standards is an inevitable consequence of security breach.Global Payments executives said they are confident that the company will regain its compliance rating with Visa and MasterCard “as soon as possible”. But the latest breach is likely to raise questions about whether the industry’s security standards are set high enough.As one security expert told a ZDNet blog, “the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is highly prescriptive in nature, but simply complying does not ensure credit card security. Companies that rely on PCI DSS to solely dictate their security measures will continue to remain vulnerable to attack.”It may also reignite demands for a comprehensive review of security breach notification rules in the US – currently a patchwork of mostly state-level laws requiring disclosure to consumers when personal information is compromised.While the Global breach reportedly happened between January 21 and February 25 and was discovered in early March, it was not until Friday after trading of its stock was halted following press reports that the company publicly acknowledged the breach.
254;V;Visa Inc;2012-04-02T22:35:01Z;Scale of credit card breach revealed;;Global Payments, a processor of credit and debit card transactions involving brands such as Visa and MasterCard, on Monday sought to ease concerns about a security breach that put up 1.5m card numbers in North America at risk of being stolen.Officials stressed that the company detected the hacking itself and Paul Garcia, the chairman and chief executive, said it was “making significant progress in defining and rectifying the event”.That was not enough to convince Visa. The world’s largest payment processor removed Global Payments from a list it publishes for merchants of data processors that meet industry standards for security. The move does not preclude Global Payments from processing transactions, including those involving Visa, but it could be a disincentive for some customers to do business with the company.Global Payments works behind the scenes in card transactions, serving as the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.MasterCard said it would consider what steps to take based on the findings of an external and independent forensic investigation.Global Payments said it was too soon to even estimate the cost to the company, but that it has insurance for these events.“This is manageable,” Mr Garcia said. “We will get through this.”The company also plans to spend more money on security and will work to get back on Visa’s registry.The breach occurred on a small number of Global Payments’ servers. The thieves did not obtain cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers. Company officials said Global Payments was “on the hook” for replacement cards.The three largest consumer credit lenders – Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan – would not comment on whether they had detected any fraudulent transactions. Discover, a card issuer that also owns its own network, said it had seen “some fraudulent activity that we believe is related to this compromise and will reissue accounts as appropriate”. American Express said it was still trying to ascertain any related theft using its cards.Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said that “there is some concern about how much the breach will cost Global Payments in the future and what it says about their technology platform and their franchise”. But 1.5m accounts was “rather small” for a breach of this kind, Mr Brendler said, referring to a 2009 hacking at Heartland Payment Systems, which compromised 130m accounts. “If they can act quickly and get back on Visa’s approved list, the damage could be contained.”On Monday, shares of Global Payments fell 3.7 per cent to $45.74. The shares dropped 9 per cent on Friday before they were suspended from trading.
255;V;Visa Inc;2012-04-02T21:06:38Z;Groupon shares sink on revenue revisions;;Shares in Groupon sunk by nearly 17 per cent on Monday as investors reacted to a restatement of revenue figures by the offers website as well as the company’s admission of “material weakness” in its internal controls.Revenues for the largest online offers website by sales were lowered $14.3m to $492.2m, the company said late on Friday after trading. Groupon blamed the revision, which wiped out its operating profits for the final months of last year, on its failure to account properly for the increased likelihood of customers seeking refunds in its newest markets.Analysts were mixed in assessing the impact the restatement would have on its shares, which are trading almost 25 per cent below their initial public offer price of $20.“We do not view the restated financials and internal process weakness as indications of fundamental softening in Groupon’s model, as indicated in the [first quarter 2012] guidance affirmation,” said Doug Anmuth, analyst at JPMorgan.“Instead we believe they reflect Groupon’s dynamic deal mix and the company’s extremely rapid growth in a very short amount of time,” Mr Anmuth added, while reducing his price target for the company’s shares to $22 from $24, but maintaining his “hold” rating.Justin Post, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said Groupon has been his team’s most disappointing call of 2012. “While we remain constructive on the local deals opportunity, and we see this accrual change as an estimation mistake in an evolving hard-to-predict business, it should take several quarters for Groupon to gain investor confidence,” he said, downgrading the company from “buy” to “hold” and lowering its price target from $30 to $20.Shares in Groupon finished down 16.9 per cent to $15.28 and have fallen by more than 26 per cent in the year to date.Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, rose 17.3 per cent to $22.70 as it rejected a $10bn cash bid from Coty, the privately owned fragrance group.Avon rebuffed the latest Coty proposal one hour after the fragrance group made the bid offer public. Avon said the proposal undervalued it and that it was “substantially the same as” an offer made two weeks ago, which it had also rejected.Shares in the cosmetics group are now up by more than 30 per cent in the year to date.After a negative start to the day, the S&P 500 climbed 0.7 per cent to 1,418.90 and reached cyclical highs yet again, as the first session of the second quarter commenced.The benchmark index was buoyed by US manufacturing data that showed growth picked up in March on stronger hiring and production.The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.4 in March from the February reading of 52.4, beating economist estimates of 53. Readings above 50 indicate growth in the sector. Elsewhere, the commerce department said construction spending unexpectedly dropped by the most in seven months despite the unseasonably warm weather.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,264.49, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.9 per cent at 3,119.70.Express Scripts, the health benefits manager, climbed 2.4 per cent to $55.50 as the Federal Trade Commission approved its merger with rival Medco Health Solutions. The takeover bid was valued at $29.1bn. If the deal is completed, it would create the biggest manager of prescription-drug benefits for corporate and government clients.Shares in Medco were down 1 per cent to $71.85, having risen nearly 30 per cent in the year to date.Lions Gate Entertainment, producer of the television series Mad Men, fell 4.5 per cent to $13.30 as the company’s latest blockbuster, Hunger Games, dominated box office returns for a second consecutive weekend, grossing $61.1m in ticket sales. The movie has generated more than $250m in the US and Canada in its first 10 days of release.Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, added 3.2 per cent to $618.63 as a report said one analyst at Topeka Capital had set a price target of $1,001 for its shares, with “no end in sight” to its recent gains.Hartford Financial Services Group, the insurance provider, rose 4.1 per cent to $21.95 as the company said it would repurchase $2.43bn worth of securities it sold to Allianz, the German insurer, during the depths of the financial crisis. Under the terms of the deal, Hartford will replace $1.75bn of debt – yielding 10 per cent – it owes to Allianz with lower yielding new debt.Global Payments, a processor of credit and debit card transactions involving brands such as Visa and MasterCard, fell another 3.7 per cent to $45.74 as it updated markets on the security breach of its system. The processing company said on Sunday up to 1.5m card numbers in North America may have been stolen by hackers.Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payment processors, were both up however on Monday, gaining 0.8 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively.
256;V;Visa Inc;2012-03-30T22:52:12Z;MasterCard and Visa warn of data breach;Visa and MasterCard;Visa and MasterCard, the word’s largest payment processors, warned that their cardholders’ account information may have been put at risk as a third-party processor of card transactions reported that its systems had been breached.Both companies said they had alerted card issuers regarding accounts that may have been affected. Visa said card account information from “all major card brands” may have been affected.Global Payments of Atlanta, Georgia, a provider of payment processing services for credit, debit and gift cards, said on Friday that it had determined in early March that card data may have been accessed, and contacted federal law enforcement. It said it identified “unauthorised access into a portion of its processing system” and continues to investigate.Global Payments, Visa and MasterCard all declined to comment on how many cardholders were potentially at risk. Visa and MasterCard said their systems were not compromised.The US Secret Service was investigating the breach, said George Ogilvie, a spokesman for the agency.Global Payments also said it “promptly notified appropriate industry parties to allow them to minimise potential cardholder impact”.Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, the three largest consumer credit card lenders, declined to comment, but people familiar with investigations said lenders were working with payment processors and were preparing to field customer inquiries about suspicious charges on their cards. It was unclear if any fraudulent charges had been made.American Express and Discover also said they were monitoring their accounts for suspicious activity.Global Payments is the seventh largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. Last year, it processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.Global Payments’ shares fell 9.1 per cent to $47.50 before they were suspended from trading early Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.“This situation speaks fundamentally to questions about how safe and secure our data is with those who have been entrusted with it,” said Denee Carrington, an analyst at Forrester Research.Last year, Citigroup fell victim to a hacking attack that exposed data on hundreds of thousands of credit card holders and raised broader concerns about online protections. This prompted the US Department of Homeland Security to join with federal law enforcement authorities to advise financial institutions on how to protect themselves from online breaches.Ms Carrington said she was troubled by the lack of information that card issuers and payment processors were providing on how the latest breach happened and how many cardholders were affected. She said the timeline of when the breach occurred and how quickly Global Payments detected it will be key for future consumer confidence in these systems.Additional reporting by Kara Scannell in New York
257;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;A bit rash to write off cash so soon;;From Mr Ron Delnevo.Sir, Maija Palmer’s article heralding a so-called cashless future (“More flash than cash”, Analysis March 21) comes as a surprise in the week the Payments Council announced that UK cash withdrawals last year reached an all-time high.The article also fails to consider the fact that the vast majority of retailers and consumers are far better served by cash payments.The British Retail Consortium recently concluded that “cash remains king” for retailers, noting that card payments are far more expensive to process than those using cash (an average cash transaction costs 1.7p in transportation and banking costs, while credit card payments cost 37.1p). Furthermore, retailers without the global scale of Starbucks (one of the main examples in Ms Palmer’s article) do not find it as easy to subsidise the installation of expensive contactless equipment, or strike bulk deals that might somewhat reduce the heavy cost of processing debit and credit card payments.Little wonder then that Visa itself refuses to disclose the number of contactless transactions that took place over the last year, but concedes that “low acceptance levels” of contactless payments are “preventing usage from becoming an everyday habit”.Ron Delnevo, Director, Payments CouncilManaging Director, Bank MachineHatfield, Herts, UK
258;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Rural Teesdale receives a digital boost;;The sports lovers set to board Transport for London’s buses this summer might be surprised to learn where the announcements telling them to “alight here for the Olympic Stadium” were recorded.Emma Hignett, whose voice will become familiar to people from around the world during the London 2012 Olympics, made the recordings at her home-based studio in Staindrop, a village in County Durham.The professional voiceover artist, whose corporate clients include Visa in the US and PayPal, exemplifies how the countryside can be a good location as long as infrastructure matches urban alternatives. Mother to a three-year-old son, she can work flexible hours with no commuting in a home studio that has broadband connectivity and ISDN technology.“I have the lifestyle I want. In the voiceover industry you can be located anywhere,” she says, but she notes that most people in the sector are based in London.Urban locations may offer support networks not apparent in the countryside but in Barnard Castle, near Staindrop, Ms Hignett can access support including advice on marketing, search engine optimisation and back-up broadband at the NeST Business and Community Hub, a rural satellite of Middlesbrough-based DigitalCity Business.This public-private body is encouraging the growth of digital businesses, in urban and rural Teesdale. Barnard Castle, a historic market town, and its countryside is an attractive environment to live and work in. This has helped the area retain Teesdale’s largest employer, a GlaxoSmithKline plant.Last week, the site’s continued importance to GSK was reinforced with the announcement of a £20m investment to make it the company’s global centre for the manufacturing of dermatological products.
259;V;Visa Inc;2012-03-15T11:53:52Z;Mobile payments company Boku raises $35m;;The frenzy to invest in mobile payments providers continues with Boku, the San Francisco-based start-up raising $35m, in a funding round led by Telefónica Digital. It will take the total raised by the mobile transactions company to more than $75m since 2008.Investors in this round also included New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, Index Ventures and Khosla Ventures.Boku allows users to make online purchases over their mobile phones, and to pay for goods physically in shops using a near field communications (NFC) chip. The company works with 250 mobile operators worldwide.The new funds will be used to help Boku expand even further. It will need to do this fast. In an increasingly crowded market where every bank and telecoms operator is launching a mobile payments service, now is the time to try to put on a sprint to grab market share.The investment is yet another way that Telefónica is looking to ensure that it will have a place in the mobile payments market. The Spanish telecoms operator has a number of irons in the fire with payments. It is developing a joint platform for payments with two of the biggest UK mobile operators, and it has been working with Visa to equip all the shops in Barcelona with readers that can take mobile phone payments. Boku is now yet another option.There is still no way of knowing which will emerge as the dominant mobile payments platform so companies such as Visa and Telefónica, which are determined not to miss out, are investing in all of them. For mobile payments start-ups there has never been a better time to raise money.
260;V;Visa Inc;2012-03-09T19:46:29Z;Cyberhackers are the most sinister of troublemakers;The practice has become a much more serious, society-threatening crime;There is at first sight a mystery about the six internet hackers revealed to be facing criminal charges in related cases in New York and Chicago on Tuesday. It is that one of the group’s ringleaders, Hector Xavier Monsegur, should have turned state’s evidence. Mr Monsegur pled guilty to several charges of hacking and conspiracy last August. He has since closed the net around his comrades. Intelligence agencies and prosecutors dream of finding a “grass” near the boss. But actually having an organisation rolled up by one of its key figures is rare.What made Mr Monsegur turn? After all, he and his associates were not just ideologically committed to a “free” internet – they were the best in their shady business. Between them, those indicted face allegations such as disrupting PayPal, MasterCard and Visa last autumn to protest their refusal to process donations to the secret-divulging website WikiLeaks. Government servers were allegedly infiltrated: Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen and Zimbabwe, the US Senate, and the Fine Gael party in Ireland. Prosecutors imply they took particular delight in hacking anti-hacking organisations: the FBI, the CIA website, the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Irish Garda and a number of private security companies.Many of the intrusions cited in the indictments were of media outlets sceptical of hacking in general and WikiLeaks in particular. Someone stole information about a Fox TV show, filched personal codes from employees of the Public Broadcasting System in the US, broke into Sony’s computers in Belgium, Russia and the Netherlands, and hacked the Tribune Company. One operation involved leaked passwords and emails from the online foreign-policy newsletter Stratfor. (Defenders of this attack who described Stratfor as a “shadow CIA” used the word “shadow” the way conspiracy theorists do: as a portentous and sinister-sounding synonym for “non-”.)The groups Mr Monsegur belonged to and the broader movement of hackers, known as Anonymous, cast themselves as either good-humoured or idealistic pranksters. Until recently there was sympathy for this view even among hackers’ most dogged adversaries in law enforcement. One of the Americans arrested this week had been sentenced to two years for a hacking offence half a decade ago. One of the Soca hackers had been arrested last year and released.But there has been a sea change in attitudes towards hacking. When the internet was a corner of the economy used by a few relative sophisticates, it was easier to analogise hacking to crimes such as breaking and entering or pickpocketing. But increasingly, the internet is the economy. Although hackers aim at institutions they find noxious, they inflict collateral damage on a lot of poor schlubs minding their own business.The charges unveiled this week include misuse of login credentials, publication of other people’s mail and filching hundreds of thousands of credit cards together with fraudulent use. Mr Monsegur had four car engines sent to him and used hacked credit cards to pay his own bills. Prosecutors in the Anglo-Irish case allege a “deliberate campaign of online destruction, intimidation, and criminality”. A favourite practice is doxing – revealing a great deal of personal data “with the object of, among other things, intimidating the victim and subjecting the victim to harassment”.To borrow the distinction Johan Huizinga drew in Homo Ludens, hackers are not cheats but spoilsports, a far more dangerous class of troublemaker. They don’t just threaten the outcome of a particular game or convention. They threaten the existence of the community that makes the game possible. Over time, hacking has become a much more serious, society-threatening crime – less like pickpocketing, say, than counterfeiting. All governments are bound to come down on it like a tonne of bricks. That is what flipped Mr Monsegur. Authorities were able to threaten him with 124 years in prison.Why did the US government permit the group around Mr Monsegur to carry out several devastating hacks in the seven months since they turned him? Perhaps it believes the group had the potential to engage in even more destructive operations. Anonymous has tried to feed this unease, posting on its Twitter feed: “LulzSec was a group, but Anonymous is a movement. Groups come and go, ideas remain.”True, but there is an ironic role-reversal here. Hackers used to be savvy futurists. They understood something about technology’s impact on society that others did not. But now it is they who have been passed by. Are hackers cyberterrorists or cyber-activists? The public is increasingly inclined to say the former. You have to be a bit stuck in 1998 to say the latter.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard
261;V;Visa Inc;2012-03-08T03:05:24Z;Three fights UK mobile payments plan;;An ambitious plan by the UK’s three largest mobile phone operators to create a mobile payments system has come a step closer to reality, with plans finally submitted to the European Commission for approval after months of discussion.However, the plan – handed to Brussels on Wednesday – faces fierce opposition from Three, a fourth competitor in the market, which raised competition concerns after being excluded from a meaningful role in the project. Three’s objections could result in damaging delays at a time when many companies are rushing to roll out mobile payments services.Everything Everywhere, the joint venture of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and O2, which is owned by Telefónica, are planning to create a platform that would allow customers to pay for goods using their smartphones, either through contactless terminals in shops or over the internet. Customers can also collect coupons, buy tickets and access other services. The joint venture, code-named project Oscar, hopes to create an alternative to ventures such as Google Wallet, which is expected to launch in the UK this spring.However, the project has been delayed after being branded “discriminatory” by Three. Talks to include the group have failed, although the operators say the platform will be run independently and will be open to all.“The JV will control and sell access to over 90 per cent of UK mobile subscribers and their data, thus allowing Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Vodafone and Telefónica to foreclose the market to third-parties and neatly do away with the inconvenience of competing with each other,” said Stephen Lerner, regulatory affairs director at Three.“We will continue to work with the competition authorities in Europe and the Office of Fair Trading in the UK to ensure that consumers benefit from the development of a competitive market for these services,” he said.Delays have meant that the joint venture will be coming into a crowded market for mobile payments, in which a number of banks and other groups have launched their own services.Barclays last month launched Pingit, a service that allows the customers to transfer money to anyone via a mobile phone, and had more than 200,000 downloads within the first two days. Other UK banks are understood to be looking at similar services. Visa and Mastercard are also investing heavily in mobile payments technology.Visa took a 15 per cent stake in the Mobile Money Network, a rival payments platform that is backed by Carphone Warehouse and works with retailers such as HMV, Goldsmiths and Thorntons. Visa expects about half the payments it handles to come from mobile services by 2020.
262;V;Visa Inc;2012-03-06T22:24:35Z;Anonymous hacker turns FBI informant;;Federal prosecutors have charged six alleged members of the Anonymous “hacktivist” group with conspiracy and computer hacking-related crimes after it emerged that an alleged leading member of the collective had turned informant of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Among those charged by the US Department of Justice in the US and elsewhere was Hector Xavier Monsegur, a New York resident whose online identity is alleged to be Sabu, one of Anonymous and LulzSec’s most prominent figures.Mr Monsegur has been co-operating with the FBI for months, a law enforcement official said.Others charged in the case include Ryan Ackroyd, alleged to use the online name Kayla, and Jake Davis, the teenager who police believe operated as Topiary, both among several arrests made in the UK last year as part of an international swoop against the hacker network.Anonymous is a large, amorphous group of so-called hacktivists who have aligned themselves with the anti-capitalist protesters Occupy Wall Street and the whistleblowing site WikiLeaks. They have carried out hacking raids on corporations and institutions including Sony, the CIA, News Corp’s British tabloid The Sun and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency.Court documents said that Mr Monsegur had been involved in denial-of-service attacks – whereby a site is flooded with so much traffic it becomes swamped and is knocked offline – against Visa, PayPal and MasterCard in December 2010. The attack was dubbed “Operation Payback” after the companies refused to process funds for WikiLeaks.The court papers said he had also hacked government IT systems in the Middle East, including Tunisia and Algeria.In an attack on News Corp’s Fox Broadcasting, Mr Monsegur is alleged to have stolen confidential information relating to contestants on the reality TV show X Factor. He is also accused of having used his hacking skills for personal gain, including credit card fraud and hijacking the systems of an automotive parts supplier to have thousands of dollars of engine components shipped to him.Although a key part of Anonymous’s philosophy is that it lacks hierarchy and is open to any volunteers, Sabu was among the most prominent members of the group alongside others with the online names Kayla, T-flow and Topiary, who claimed to execute some of its most aggressive online attacks, including on the security firm HBGary.In a posting to his Twitter account, which has remained silent since news of the arrests broke, Sabu told his 45,000 followers that the US government was run by “cowards”: “Don’t give in to these people. Fight back. Stay strong.” In his last public post, in German, he quotes Rosa Luxemburg, the German communist revolutionary: “The revolution says I am, I was, I will be.”“This is not the end of Anonymous,” said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, an internet security firm. “But it’s going to take them a while to recover from the paranoia they must be feeling right now. While Anonymous is often characterised as having no leaders, Sabu was clearly one they were looking up to. Now that they realise they should not have trusted Sabu, who can they trust?”
263;V;Visa Inc;2012-03-05T18:03:35Z;Libya bars Egypt workers in revolt reprisal;;Egypt is paying the price for its ruling military council’s failure to wholeheartedly back last year’s revolution in neighbouring Libya in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, officials in Tripoli’s transitional authority say.Libya has tightened rules for thousands of Egyptian labourers eager to return to old jobs or to find new work in the oil-rich country while lifting restriction for Tunisians, who have flooded the Libyan service sector.“I was in Libya for seven years,” said Farag Mohammed, an Egyptian fisherman among the hundreds waiting outside the Libyan embassy in Cairo to get a visa to return to his old job. “Now they are telling me my papers are missing. There are no visas.”Libyan officials say they tightened visa requirements because they worry that some Egyptians share kinship ties to tribes that supported the ousted regime of late Col Muammer Gaddafi. But privately they say they are also upset at Egypt’s ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), accusing it of harbouring former Gaddafi regime loyalists and harassing Libyan revolutionaries at border crossings and airports as they tried to make their way to eastern Libya last year.“They didn’t help us during the revolution,” said Yousef Salabi, whose older brother, Ali Salabi, is a leading cleric and part of Libya’s rising new political elite. “Now there are some big fishes from the former regime hiding in Egypt.”Egyptian officials deny the accusations, insisting they played a key role in providing humanitarian aid to Libya’s rebels. They also say they are co-operating with Tripoli authorities to bring alleged Gaddafi allies to justice.“Those people, after the fall of Libya, entered Cairo and Egypt like any Libyan because we had visa exemptions,” said Ayman Mousharafa, Egypt’s deputy assistant minister of foreign affairs for north Africa. “If the Libyan government has a full detailed demand for extradition of people, saying they are criminals or misused the funds of the Libyan people, they should present it. There are international processes that should be done to according to international laws.”The issue is crucial for Egypt’s economy, which has suffered in the aftermath of the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak last year. Its deficit is widening and its foreign reserves have plummeted. Unemployment officially stands at 12 per cent but analysts say the real figure could be far higher.Up to 1.5m Egyptians worked in Libya before the revolution, sending back remittances of up to $1bn a year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Libya also has investments worth at least $10bn in Egypt, according to Libyan and western analysts, and some worry the new authorities in Tripoli could liquidate the holdings.Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, head of Egypt’s ruling military council, visited Libya in January in an attempt to mend ties but was heckled by protesters demanding that his country return former Gaddafi loyalists to Libya. Libyans accuse SCAF of harbouring, among others, former interior minister Nasser Mabrouk and Khaled al-Touhami, a former security chief allegedly responsible for a long-running crackdown on Islamists.“We are insisting and sending calls to all countries that friendly relations should be enhanced by showing sympathy for the Libyan cause by not harbouring these elements,” a Libyan diplomat said. “It is causing anger in Libya.“On the Libyan street, the population is thinking the government bodies are not putting pressure and doing enough work to legally chase these remnants of the old regime. Some of them are very dangerous.”Ideological differences between Libya’s ascendant political class and Egypt’s military rulers also colour the dispute. Former president Hosni Mubarak and Col Gaddafi collaborated for decades in suppressing Islamist movements that are now taking power across north Africa. Libyan officials privately say they believe Mr Tantawi and his entourage remain hostile to the new political forces unleashed by the continuing wave of revolutions across the region.Mr Mousharafa gave details of how Egypt helped Libya during the uprising, including receiving tens of thousands of refugees and dispatching physicians to treat wounded in Benghazi.“We had 1.3m people scattered all over Libya,” he said. “We were scared that if we recognised the Libyan revolution, Col Gaddafi would use them as human shields.”But a former Egyptian health ministry official who transferred humanitarian supplies to Libya during the uprising said help was provided to Libya by individuals and organisations, and even the foreign ministry, without the co-operation or knowledge of the ruling military council.In reality, security officials under the command of SCAF systematically harassed Egyptians trying to provide aid as well as Libyans trying to move back and forth, he said. “They didn’t care about the political relations,” added the former official, a doctor who asked that his name not be used for fear of retribution. “The people in Tunisia wanted to help [in Libya], so they did. But here, the generals wouldn’t take the political decision whether to help or not.”
264;V;Visa Inc;2012-03-02T18:25:18Z;Ping, swipe or wave – pay by mobile;Vodafone and Visa announce latest tie-up;Vodafone and Visa have announced a deal that will allow shoppers to make purchases using mobile phones instead of cash or cards – but customers have so far been slow to take up new contactless payment options.“Visa payWave”, as the new system is known, will allow customers to pay for small items by swiping their smartphone on a reader. It has the potential to become the largest virtual wallet scheme of its kind in the world, the companies claim – with Vodafone’s chief executive, Vittorio Colao, describing it as “the next stage of the smartphone revolution”.However, technology analysts said companies have a long way to go before phones replace coins, paper money or plastic.Mobile wallets that enable users to pay for goods and services by holding their phone against a reader are already available, but are used for very few payments.Last year, Orange and Barclaycard released the Samsung Tocco Quick Tap phone, the first handset able to make contactless mobile phone payments in the UK. Users can top-up their pre-pay account and use the phone for transactions of up to £15.O2, Google and T-Mobile all plan to launch similar devices in the UK, and high street chains, including Boots and McDonald’s, have so far installed 80,000 contactless payment readers in outlets around the country. By the time the London Olympics begin, there are expected to be 100,000 contactless readers in use.Mobile phone users should be able to set a maximum monthly spending limit, according to the communications industry regulator, after finding that millions of customers are hit by unexpectedly large charges each year.Research by Ofcom shows that 1.4m phone customers received a surprisingly heavy bill in the past six months – often as the result of having their phone stolen, or using it abroad.The regulator believes that phone price plans do not do a good enough job of clarifying how much customers will pay if they use their phone in the UK and overseas.As a result, it wants UK operators to extend the existing limits on “roaming” data charges in Europe to customers using their phones in the UK.“Consumers have low levels of awareness about how to protect themselves and can find it difficult to find information about data charges from their provider,” Ofcom argues.Companies are also in talks with the regulator about the potential to set a cap on a customer’s bill if it is stolen. At present, if thieves run up a huge bill on a stolen phone, the consumer can be liable for the full amount.Consumer group Which? is calling for new measures to help users manage their spending“We want clearer information for customers from the phone companies about what they charge for services in the UK and abroad, plus greater protection for consumers from hefty data charges,” said executive director, Richard Lloyd. “We want to see more pressure put on UK operators to adopt data caps and spending alerts.”In Africa, where people are more likely to have a mobile phone than a bank account, these payment systems are already widely used. In the west, though, the take-up of mobile payment options has been patchy.Sandra Quinn, of the UK Payments Council, said mobile transaction volumes remain low because consumers already have payment options, and are still worried about security.“It’s a chicken and egg situation,” she argued. “Retailers and handset sellers are reluctant to invest in something unless they know customers will use it. But customers won’t start using it until retailers install it and phone providers promote it.”Analysts suggest providers would need to offer incentives to encourage customers to adopt the new payment method.Orange has started to do this, unveiling Quick Tap Treats for customers who pay with their phone in the restaurant chain Eat. Once mobile payments are more widely used, providers say they plan to offer loyalty schemes in the same way as Nectar or Boots reward cards. But mobile phones can only be used as electronic wallets if they are fitted with certain technology – and, so far, few handsets in the UK have the “near field communication” capability needed.At this week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the online payment provider PayPal said waiting for new phones to be released would take too long. It is promoting its own payment system, already accepted in Pizza Express restaurants, that allows users to pay a bill using a PayPal application download on to a phone.An alternative to mobile payments – mobile money transfers – have proved more popular. Barclays says its new Pingit app, which allows customers to make payments to other bank accounts via text message, was downloaded 20,000 times in two days after its launch in late February. But mass adoption of mobile wallets is likely to take longer.Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile at Visa Europe, said the goal is to allow customers to pay with mobiles regardless of who their bank or phone provider is.But, so far, the banks, shops, telecom companies and phone-makers cannot agree on who will get the lion’s share of the lucrative customer data that mobile payments would generate.
265;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Mobile operators submit pay plan to Brussels;;The UK’s largest mobile operators are preparing to submit plans for a mobile payment system for European regulatory consideration next week, although they will face continued opposition from rival company Three.Everything Everywhere, Vodafone and O2 have agreed to submit their plans to Brussels for approval next week after months of discussion. They have held exploratory talks with European regulators about the joint platform of mobile payments in the UK, code-named Project Oscar, and hope for approval in advance of the rumoured launch of the Google Wallet payment system.However, Three – the UK mobile operator owned by Hong Kong’s Hutchison Whampoa – will continue to object to the process after the end of talks to join the platform, which it views as discriminatory. The operators say that the platform will be run independently and open to all.People close to the submission said that they had been waiting for further engagement with Three, although it said that the talks had ended at the end of last year.Stephen Lerner, regulatory affairs director at Three, said: “Fundamental questions about the scope, intent and competition implications of the JV’s plans to establish a ‘one-stop shop’ for both mobile wallets and mobile marketing remain unanswered. We are concerned that the proposed joint venture will not benefit UK consumers and should be robustly investigated.”A spokesman for the joint venture said: “Everything Everywhere, Telefónica and Vodafone are creating a platform for mobile advertising and mobile payments which will provide open access and participation to all interested parties on non-discriminatory terms. In our forthcoming submissions to the European Commission we will be further detailing the reasons why the joint venture will strengthen competition and benefit consumers.”Payment schemes have dominated the announcements at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, with partnerships announced between the operators, banks and credit-card providers as companies begin to position themselves for what they hope will be a lucrative revenue stream.Operators want payments to be made by their phones, allowing them access to billing and advertising businesses, by replacing debit and credit cards with applications and an ability to swipe the phone using a technology called near-field communications.However, even though they will compete at a retail level for customers – for example with Vodafone having this week agreed a joint venture to produce a branded cash debit service with Visa – the largest operators are working on a common system to provide the service backbone. Banks and companies with financial services arms such as Tesco can then adopt the “mobile wallet” for their own credit or debit services.Operators worldwide have begun to form or rollout their own local mobile payment platforms. In the US, there is a similar joint venture to Project Oscar that is called Isis. There have also been talks to form a European platform for payments. Aspects such as portability are still to be resolved. Stephane Richard, chief executive of France Telecom, on Monday said that every SIM shipped this year would contain near-field technology.Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile at Visa Europe, which has partnerships with several operators, said that the Vodafone agreement would be compatible with the various industry attempts to form common platforms. “This is a move from plastic cards to mobile devices,” she said. “We are at the frontier of new applications on the back of the growth in smartphones.”
266;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
267;V;Visa Inc;2012-02-27T22:47:49Z;Visa in partnership with Vodafone;;Visa, the world’s largest payment processor, has announced a “worldwide partnership” with UK telecoms group Vodafone that will allow mobile phone customers to pay for goods and services using their handset.The mobile wallet service will be available across all 30 countries that Vodafone operates in, starting with the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey.Initially customers will be required to set up a pre-paid account in order to make payments, but the platform will be opened up to other financial institutions that offer Visa in the future, according to Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile at Visa Europe.The gradual shift away from cash boosted Visa Europe’s revenue 15 per cent last year, to £1bn, and the group identified electronic banking services as the future of payments.Visa’s partnership with the Vodafone is the latest in a stream of deals between telecom groups and the financial services industry to launch services that will allow customers to use their smartphone as a way to access their money.Google, PayPal, Orange and Barclaycard have all staked a claim on the new market, but the number of handsets equipped with the necessary technology remains limited.Retailers have also been wary of installing the readers necessary for contactless payment by phone, although chains such as retailer Alliance Boots and McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, have now introduced terminals.Card issuers have made the transaction charges less than those for credit or debit card payments, but retailers are unsure if this situation will last.Retailers which install readers pay a lower merchant service charge per transaction than that charged for debit or credit cards, but Sarah Cordey at the British Retail Consortium questioned how long this would last.“At the moment it’s an incentive for trials,” she said. “We will be keeping an eye on how the charges levied by the banks for retailers that allow customers to pay with mobile phones develop in the future.”Providers are now working to educate customers, who have expressed concern at the security of using their phone in place of their wallet. Orange recently launched a new incentive scheme to encourage its customers to use their phones to make payments, offering “Quick Tap Treats” such as coffee or baguettes in restaurant chain Eat.“There are not very many live users yet,” said Sandra Quinn at the UK Payments Council, which co-ordinates payment systems. “It has not been an industry-wide scheme, but perhaps now it’s time has come. Customers need time to get used to the idea of using the phone for payments.”Visa plans to use the London Olympics later this year to showcase mobile phone technology, linking up with Samsung to offer athletes and visitors the chance to purchase goods at the games with their phone.
268;V;Visa Inc;2012-02-19T03:39:21Z;Success is built on concentrated effort to find bargains;Focusing on a few select stocks can pay off over the longer term;"Running concentrated funds is one way for active managers to avoid being labelled as index-huggers, failing to depart significantly from their benchmark indices. The question is whether investing with conviction delivers outperformance.Judging by the results from one such strategy, focusing on a few select stocks can pay off over the longer term. The Concentrated Value Equity Composite strategy, run by Chicago-based Harris Associates, which holds only 24 US stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 on an annualised return basis over three, five, 10 and 15 years, net of fees.It beat the index in 11 of the past 20 years, often substantially (in 2001 by 44 percentage points and in 2009 by 30 percentage points), while its worst underperformance was 9.5 percentage points in 1998. In 2011, it trailed by 4.5 percentage points.A Luxembourg-based mirror fund, the €146.86m Concentrated US Value Fund, launched in September, has underperformed so far, having returned 6.15 per cent (annualised) since launch in September, against 8.97 per cent for the S&P 500.Michael Mangan, one of three portfolio managers running the Concentrated US Value Fund, says all the portfolios run by Harris Associates are concentrated, typically holding either 18-22 stocks or 40-50. This approach is “born of a feeling that active management should be active”, he says.The group, which is owned by Natixis Global Asset Management and has $44.5bn under management, looks for companies it can buy at a discount to perceived value – ideally 60 cents on the dollar, a dollar representing what a “rational business person would pay”, says Mr Mangan. It looks also for “a business value that is growing over time”, and for management teams that “think and act like owners”, and have significant ownership.Finally, “we want the comfort that, when they have free cash flow they will use it in the best way for the business”.Managers select stocks from an approved list – of 160 for US portfolios, and tend to hold them long term. Mr Mangan says annual turnover on the portfolios is around 35 per cent.The focus on value means the Harris funds did not participate in the tech boom of the late 1990s, and like others who stuck to their style were “considered dinosaurs”. But, “we didn’t believe the math had changed”, says Mr Mangan. So they did no better than the market, sometimes worse, “only to be rewarded post crash”.In 2008, once again, “the math had not changed in terms of present value and future cashflows”, and although during the panic period, Mr Mangan and team did not perform any better than others, “we thought if we were right on valuation we should get paid more than average on the other side. We were up 57 per cent in the Concentrated [strategy] in 2009.”Being right on valuation is not just about buying cheap companies with low price/earnings ratios, he adds, pointing to the group’s holdings in Visa and Mastercard, which could be seen as growth businesses. “Our focus is on discount to value,” he says, describing how an opportunity came up late in 2010 to buy these companies cheaply thanks to one of the Dodd-Frank rule changes that capped the transaction fees for large card issuers.The stock price fell a lot on news of this change relative to the impact it would have on the business of Visa and Mastercard, says Mr Mangan. Debit card business makes up about 15-20 per cent of Visa’s US business, for example, and 50 per cent of its business is outside the US. “So 80 per cent of its business was not affected by the rule change – and that is growing at 13-14 per cent.”Investing in a few companies clearly has capacity implications. Harris has closed products in the past, says Mr Mangan, generally to ensure it has flexibility to pursue the best ideas and move the portfolio around.“In the current environment, for the concentrated strategy, we have $2bn-$3bn of additional capacity.” Much depends on the market environment: “If the market went to eight times earnings, there would be some good ideas to exploit; if it went to 20 times, there would be a lot less.”The group’s US balanced fund is closed to new investors, he adds, “because we can’t stomach buying any more bonds”, and its equity exposure is already close to 70 per cent – at the high end of the permitted range."
269;V;Visa Inc;2012-02-13T23:46:48Z;Aim’s Monitise leans towards Nasdaq listing;;Monitise, which provides the technology behind the mobile money services of most UK retail banks, says it is considering a float in the US as interest in mobile banking increases and the company begins to outgrow its quotation on Aim.The London company revealed on Monday that it had tripled revenues for the six months to the end of December, and raised its full-year forecasts in the latest sign of the speed at which the mobile banking industry is growing.“Aim has been good to us, we have raised money on Aim five times, but at some point we are going to hit a ceiling,” said Alastair Lukies, chief executive, who appointed Goldman Sachs as financial adviser to the company this month.“No decisions have been made yet, but our aspiration is to be the biggest company in this space. We have to ensure we can continue to grow,” he said.The company has seen its stock market valuation increase more than 40 per cent to £295m in the past year.Mr Lukies said he was still undecided between London’s main market and Nasdaq, but hinted that he was leaning towards the US where valuations for technology companies are typically much higher.“The way people attribute value to a company in the technology sector is completely different in the US,” he said. “And look at the fact that we have had 110 technology floats in the past three years, and 107 of them have been in the US.”Monitise, which was spun out of Morse, the UK IT services company in 2007, is being buoyed by a wave of interest in providing payment and banking services over mobile phones and has benefited from a strong relationship with Visa.The company is providing technology for Visa’s debit processing service in the US, which will allow bank customers to check their balances and transfer funds via their mobile phones. Visa DPS reaches about 70 per cent of US consumers.Visa is vying with companies including Google and Telefónica to launch mobile wallet services. Analysts at Jupiter Research estimate that about $240bn of transactions were made over mobile devices in 2011. That amount is expected to triple over the next five years.Monitise, which works with UK retailers including Carphone Warehouse and 250 US banks, says it handles about 480m transactions a year, up from 120m in 2010.Sales grew to £15.8m, from £5.3m a year earlier, and the company raised its forecast for full-year revenues to £34m from £28m.The company is still loss-making, due to the heavy costs of expansion, including into Asia.
270;V;Visa Inc;2012-02-09T21:57:41Z;Muted share price reaction to foreclosure deal;;US bank stocks saw a mixed reaction, as US regulators announced a deal that could be worth up to $39.5bn to resolve allegations that the largest US mortgage lenders improperly foreclosed on homes.The five biggest lenders will take a $25bn hit on mortgage principal writedowns and interest payments but the majority will come out of existing reserves.This is just a shuffling of losses. There will be almost no impact on bank balance sheets this quarter,” said Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities. Bank of America, which has $30bn in loan loss provision and an additional $8bn in litigation reserves according to Atlantic Equities research, climbed 0.6 per cent to $8.18, its highest level since August.But JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent to $37.86, despite announcing that it will not require new reserves to cover its share of the settlement. Citigroup was off 1.7 per cent to $33.66 and Wells Fargo fell 0.2 per cent to $30.58.Exposure to legal risk stemming from the housing crisis has weighed heavily on bank share prices.But Tom Burnell at Wells Fargo cautioned that the banks remain open to litigation on mortgage origination and securitisation practices, as well criminal prosecutions by federal and state governments and claims brought by individual homeowners.News that leaders of the main Greek parties had reached a deal on spending cuts broke just before markets opened in New York, but US stocks barely flickered in response.“The market has seen such a big move up, that to break out again we need to see a significant catalyst, which the Greek deal is not,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.The S&P 500 closed up 0.15 per cent to 1,351.95 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1 per cent to 12,890.46.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,927.23, as Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, set an all-time high of $496., before falling back to $493.17, still up 3.5 per cent on the day.Reports suggested the company may launch a new iPad model in March, while Canaccord Genuity analysts said Apple shares could climb as high as $665 after its retail checks showed “strong sales trends for the iPhone 4S at all three US carriers and overall strong iPhone sales in international markets”.The S&P 500 is just 12 points short of its post-financial crisis closing high of 1,363 hit last April with Apple at the centre of that recovery.Technology stocks now account for 20 per cent of the benchmark US index’s market capitalisation, an increase of more than 10 per cent since April. The weighting of financials remains a full percentage point lower than last April. Payment processing companies have been one of the few bright spots for financials and Visa climbed 3.8 per cent to $112.42 yesterday, after reporting strong results that suggested new regulations on card payments were not weighing on the company.Visa’s shares are now up 60 per cent since the start of 2011, while those of MasterCard have climbed 77 per cent over the same period.But Donald Fanetti at Citigroup warned that credit card companies are likely to see a seasonal uptick in delinquencies when they publish data on parts of their portfolio next week, which could weigh on the stocks.Shares in PepsiCo fell 3.7 per cent to $64.27, after the company said it would cut 8,700 jobs and said “structural” changes, such as divestitures or joint ventures, would be considered if the North America beverage business does not show improvement in the next 18 months.Shares in Groupon fell 13.7 per cent to $21.75, after the discount coupon website declared a loss in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company.That eradicated gains made in the first two days of February, when Facebook’s IPO filing triggered a rally in social media stocks. It may also have generated profit for short-sellers, who had borrowed and sold more than two-thirds of available Groupon shares ahead of earnings.TripAdvisor fell 14.6 per cent to $28.29, after the online travel-recommendation service missed analyst estimates with its first earnings report since being spun off from Expedia.Lorillard, a cigarette maker, climbed 9.7 per cent to $124.37, after it lifted its dividend 25 cents to $1.55 in strong results. That helped rival Philip Morris climb 2.8 per cent to $80.06.Akamai Technologies surged 10.5 per cent to $38.06. The network server provider reported quarterly sales and profit that topped analyst estimates.Shares in Diamond Foods fell 37 per cent to $23.13 after the company ousted its chief executive and said it would restate its accounts after a probe. That put at risk Diamond’s planned purchase of the Pringles brand from Procter & Gamble, although shares in P&G were up 0.6 per cent to $64.04.Hospital operators sold off as a note from Gary Taylor at Citigroup said inpatient admissions in January fell 1.75 per cent compared to the same month in 2011.Tenet Healthcare fell 4.8 per cent to $5.58 and HCA was off 4 per cent to $27.80.
271;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa beats expectations in first quarter;;Visa beat analysts’ earnings expectations in its fiscal first quarter as consumers increasingly pay with cards versus cash.The world’s largest payment processor also announced a fresh $500m share buy-back programme and raised its forecasts for its full-year financial performance.Net income rose to $1bn or $1.49 a share in the three months ended December 31, up from $884m and $1.23 a share in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts’ estimates were for net income of just under $1bn and earnings of $1.45 a share, according to Bloomberg.“We continued to benefit from the secular shift to electronic payments,” said Joe Saunders, chairman and chief executive.That trend drove an 8 per cent jump in Visa’s total processed transactions to 13.6bn.Net operating revenue was $2.5bn, up 14 per cent from a year ago, driven by double-digit growth in revenue from service, data processing and international transactions. Operating expenses climbed 7 per cent to $929m.For 2012, Visa forecast net revenue growth in the low double digits versus previous guidance for growth in the high single to low double digits. It raised expectations for earnings a share to grow in the high teens versus the mid-to-high teens.Mr Saunders said the outlook took into account new regulation limiting debit swipe fees and preventing banks from setting exclusive deals with payment networks. “2012 will take the brunt of debit regulation,” he said, adding that he expected growth to accelerate in 2013.In after-hours trading, Visa’s shares rose 3.1 per cent to $111.65.
272;V;Visa Inc;2012-02-07T19:04:32Z;Itaú to buy out Redecard;;Itaú-Unibanco plans to spend almost $7bn to buy out credit card processing company Redecard, as Brazil’s biggest private sector lender fights for control of one of the most lucrative sectors of the country’s banking industry.Redecard and its rivals have posted some of the biggest gains on Brazil’s stock exchange recently as the surging middle class increases demand among retailers for card processing services.The São Paulo-based bank said on Tuesday it planned to buy the 49.99 per cent of Redecard it did not already own, offering R$11.77bn ($6.84bn) to take the company private.In the past 12 months, Redecard’s shares have risen 60 per cent, while the sector’s biggest company, Cielo, has soared about 80 per cent.However, competition has become fierce after Redecard and Cielo lost exclusivity agreements with MasterCard and Visa respectively in July 2010. Although the two groups still hold more than 80 per cent of the $400bn-a-year industry, new competitors have started to enter the market, such as Elavon from the US, following the end of the so-called duopoly.“After the market opened, new opportunities became available for lots of different companies as commercial establishments could just choose whatever machine they wanted,” said Luis Miguel Santacreu, an analyst at Austin Asis, a banking sector consultancy.According to a securities filing on Tuesday, Itaú will offer R$35 for each of the 336.39m Redecard shares currently trading on São Paulo’s stock exchange.The offer, which represented about a 9 per cent premium to Redecard’s closing price on Monday, caused the card processor’s shares to surge almost 10 per cent on Tuesday and notch up their biggest daily gain since October 2009.Provided the offer was approved by shareholders, Itaú said it planned to delist Redecard after acquiring the company’s outstanding shares.Aside from giving Itaú greater access to Brazil’s growing consumer class, the credit card processing sector was attractive because of its relative low costs and high returns, said Mr Santacreu.“The operational cost of credit cards is much lower than that of cheques, and banks can make money both from the commercial establishment where the machine is and also from the high rates the customers have to pay,” he said.“Also many Brazilians who don’t have current accounts at banks, have credit cards. It’s their first introduction to the banking system, so we are seeing an explosion in the number of credit cards being emitted.”According to Abecs, Brazil’s credit card and services association, more than half of purchases of groceries, petrol, and clothes in Brazil last year were made using electronic payment methods.However, when it came to leisure spending, 71 per cent of purchases were made using traditional methods such as cash.
273;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard profits sunk by litigation costs;;MasterCard, the payment processing network, on Wednesday said that it took a $495m after-tax charge in the fourth quarter related to litigation against what otherwise were better than expected earnings.MasterCard and Visa, its rival, face lawsuits from merchants alleging price fixing over fees. MasterCard said that the fourth-quarter charge represented the company’s financial portion of the potential settlement in these cases, which have carried on for several years. A trial is expected to commence in September.Excluding the charge, consumers’ increasing propensity to spend money using credit and debit cards drove a 24 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit from the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $514m, or $4.03 per share, in the three months ended December 31, beating analysts’ estimates for net income of $498m and $3.91 per share. Net revenue increased 20.2 per cent to $1.7bn, matching Wall Street forecasts.“We are seeing sustained momentum driven by new deals and the ongoing shift away from paper-based payments,” said Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s president and chief executive officer.Including the charge, however, MasterCard reported net income of just $19m, or $0.15 cents per share in the fourth quarter versus net income of $415m and $3.17 per share in the same quarter a year ago.By mid-morning in New York, shares had surged 6 per cent to $379.02.In the quarter, processed transactions rose 23.2 per cent to 7.7bn, the company said, while the amount spent on MasterCard branded cards rose 16.3 per cent to $863bn. As of December 31, the company’s customers had issued 1.8bn MasterCard and Maestro brand cards, up more than 11 per cent from the previous year.The increase in MasterCard’s volumes came in spite of sluggish US economic growth in the second half of last year and an escalating debt crisis in Europe.“For the full-year, despite ongoing uncertainties, we posted strong performance ahead of our long-term objectives,” Mr Banga said.For the full-year 2011, the company had net income of $2.4bn, or $18.70 per share, excluding the litigation charge in the fourth quarter. Last year, MasterCard stock rose 66 per cent, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500.Company officials said they were confident MasterCard could achieve a compound annual growth rate of 12 to14 per cent in net revenues and at least 20 per cent in earnings per share this year and next.MasterCard’s financial results are seen as a barometer of broad-based consumer spending. American Express last month reported higher than expected earnings for the fourth quarter, capping a year of record cardholder spending, but its customers are more affluent.

Think of it as a taster course:The government reduced the cap on permitted cash payments to €1,000 (down from €2,500) in December. According to the designers, who acknowledge the law’s positive genesis — it’s an effort to clamp down on tax evasion (one friend described shopping in Italy as entering a multi-dimensional pricing universe, in which there was the “cash price” and the “charge price” — i.e. the recorded price and the one that was a little more…fungible) — in practice it has meant, says Gabbana, that “we are losing a lot of money in the January sales.”According to Mssrs Dolce & Gabbana, customers who want to pay cash for their cashmere coats and embroidered bustier dresses, when told it is impossible, rather than handing over an Amex or Visa, are simply leaving the shop empty handed instead — and not just Italians, but also Chinese tourists, who often pay in cash overseas because their cards are not compatible with Western chip-and-pin terminals.“The law was the right thing to do, but…” Dolce shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.“…it’s a problem,” finished Gabbana.Now the question is what they, and other designers, are going to do about it. I guess we can chew on that one for awhile.
275;V;Visa Inc;2012-01-23T12:42:07Z;An awful lot of file sharing in Brazil;;When the US Justice Department shut down Megaupload.com on January 19, it must have expected a furious reaction. Under the banner of hacker collective Anonymous and using the slogan Mega Tango Down, global attacks were launched almost immediately that, among other things, briefly removed all content from the website of CBS, the US network, on Sunday.A lot of the hacker action happened in Brazil, where more than 100 government sites were blocked over the weekend along with the Brazilian sites of Visa, Mastercard, and singer songwriter Paula Fernandes, a rising pop phenomenon.How so? According to DomainTools, an internet analytics website, Megaupload drew 8.4 per cent of its traffic from Brazil (click on the Site Profile tab to view) - second only to France, responsible for 10.3 per cent.From the Brazilian end, Megaupload is even bigger. Sandvine, an internet analysis site, says the file sharing site accounted for an extraordinary 11.39 per cent of all internet traffic in Brazil before its abrupt end.Part of a broader problem of copyright infringement? Brazil has been criticised for years for failing to protect intellectual property. In spite of some recent crackdowns, pirated CDs and DVDs are readily available at street markets around the country. File sharing sites – and there are plenty of others apart from Megaupload – have spread like forest fires.It may also reflect the fact that Brazil faces its own version of SOPA, the US anti-piracy bill delayed last week by vigorous internet-based lobbying. Brazil’s bill has been before Congress since 2003 but the debate over SOPA and the related bill PIPA has brought it back under public attention.If nothing else, shutting down Megaupload should free up a lot of bandwidth in Brazil. Perhaps internet users will take the opportunity to access legitimate sources of free music. Perhaps.Which gives us a flimsy excuse to offer this YouTube clip of Paula Fernandes with guests Victor & Leo – 27m hits and counting.
276;V;Visa Inc;2012-01-17T16:30:51Z;Debit card boost for Visa Europe;;Visa Europe, the payments business, generated a record £1bn of revenue last year as consumers increasingly used their debit cards to purchase goods and services.The independently owned European arm of Visa said spending on debit cards rose 27 per cent in the UK in the year to September 2011 and 16 per cent in Europe. In total Visa Europe processed 1bn transactions every month and, on its busiest day in the run-up to Christmas, recorded more than 1,200 card payments a second.Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe, said the growth had been fuelled by consumers turning to debit cards for even low value items and more online purchases.He expected strong growth to continue this year as the group prepares to launch a mobile payments system and a new “digital wallet” service. These kinds of electronic banking services allow consumers to store details of their debit and credit cards in one place on their mobile phone. They can then tap the card they want to use to make fast payments.Visa is in discussions with a number of the big UK banks to provide digital wallet services for them to offer customers.Electronic payments are also likely to receive a boost as retailers and transport providers in the UK and across Europe move to offer so-called contactless payments.Mr Ayliffe expected London travellers to be able to use contactless debit cards, which do not require pin codes, to pay for bus journeys around the capital from April this year. He said the London tube network was looking to install similar technology.Last year Visa Europe issued 20m contactless cards in the UK and expects another 10m this year.The group is owned by 4,000 banks and other payment providers and passes profit that is not used to build up capital reserves back to its members.Revenue last year rose 15 per cent to £1bn, from £878m a year earlier.
277;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Barcelona first ‘tap and go’ city in Europe;;La Caixa, Spain’s largest retail bank, will on Thursday begin rolling out contactless, “tap and go” payments cards and terminals across Barcelona, in one of the biggest deployments of the financial services technology in Europe.The bank will issue 1m cards to its customers containing a wireless computer chip which transmits payment straight to a merchant’s terminal when it is waved or tapped on a special reader. La Caixa is providing 17,000 payment terminals to merchants across the city, to ensure that customers can pay with a single tap everywhere from the largest department store to the smallest tobacconist’s shop.The bank, which has teamed up with Visa Europe for the project, will also provide 500 ATM machines with contactless readers.Contactless payments are beginning to be introduced in many parts of the world, with banks and payment services companies such as Visa and MasterCard hoping the system will gradually replace the use of physical cash for small purchases.Banks receive a small fee for processing card payments – typically about 0.5 per cent per transaction for La Caixa – and are keen to extend the use of cards as far as possible. Card payments also allow them to collect data on their customers shopping and lifestyle habits, which can be valuable for sales and marketing purposes.“The payment industry is changing and we want to have a leading position in this technology. It is a tool that creates a lot of convenience for customers, and will increase the share of card payments,” Antonio Massanell, managing director of Caixabank, said.Although La Caixa is issuing the wireless chip embedded in traditional-looking bank cards, they can also be embedded in mobile phones or watches. Samsung already makes handsets containing payment chips and a number of other contactless-enabled mobile phones are expected on the market this year.Last year, Google partnered MasterCard and Sprint, the telecoms operators, to launch the Google Wallet, for mobile payments. Restaurant chains such as McDonald’s and Starbucks have introduced contactless card readers across their stores, and Orange and Barclaycard launched a mobile payment system in the UK last year.However, Barcelona will be the first European city in which the technology will be close to ubiquitous. Barcelona was selected as a starting point because La Caixa hopes to showcase the technology during next month’s Mobile World Congress, the key trade show for the mobile phone industry.Mr Massanell said the bank would spend about €9m on equipping Barcelona, and would spend between €35m and €40m extending the programme across Spain over the next three years.La Caixa, which has 10.5m customers, carried out pilot programmes for the payment system in Sitges, a small town in Catalonia, and in the Balearic Islands, which Mr Massanell said had been a “great success”.Some 86 per cent of cardholders in those trials said they preferred using contactless cards, and merchants saw a 23 per cent increase in sales volumes.
278;V;Visa Inc;2012-01-06T22:00:11Z;US stocks start year on front foot;Strong US data buoy markets;US stocks started the year on an upbeat note as economic data continued to surprise on the upside.By the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was 1.8 per cent higher over the week at 1,280.68, breaking above its 200-day moving average, an indication some investors think the rally has further to run.After opening lower on Wednesday and Thursday, the benchmark index turned positive each day as stocks gathered momentum, almost repeating the trick on Friday but closing down slightly.“At open, the market is still dominated by European fears,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers Investment Research. “But it’s a positive sign that bulls are tending to take charge on the realisation that the US economy appears to be improving faster than expected.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average produced a weekly gain of 1.2 per cent at 12,359.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.7 per cent to 2,674.22.Stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied on higher than expected fourth-quarter shipments. Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.
279;V;Visa Inc;2012-01-06T18:56:05Z;Baseball fan steps up at Yahoo;;If his surprise ascension this week to one of the top jobs in the internet world left many observers feeling underwhelmed, Scott Thompson was not about to let it ruin his day.“I’m a confident person,” he declared, after being named to the vacant chief executive position at Yahoo. Wall Street may have questioned his apparent lack of relevant experience, but the man himself barely missed a beat.“I’m comfortable about acknowledging what I know, and what I don’t know,” he said with a level of equanimity that belied the intense pressure he will be under in one of the most exposed positions in the media and internet industries.The job of turning round Yahoo has proved too much for a succession of chief executives, most recently Carol Bartz, who was sacked in September after a two-and-a-half-year stint.Yet as with his predecessor, Yahoo’s board is again gambling on an executive who is largely unknown in the wider business world and who comes with a solid, if limited, reputation earned outside the media and advertising industries.“He’s not exactly a household name,” complained one long-suffering Yahoo shareholder, who has been among those agitating for Yahoo to move faster with its deliberations over a structural overhaul, including a possible sale of its valuable Asian assets.Yet, reviewing Mr Thompson’s record, and the early impression he left after facing down sceptical questioning from some analysts this week, even this investor was prepared to acknowledge that Yahoo’s latest new broom brings strong qualities.FT tech writers upload their viewsMr Thompson’s route to the top of one of the biggest digital media concerns has not been an obvious one.After graduating in accounting and computer science from Stonehill College, a small Roman Catholic institution close to his home town of Raynham in Massachusetts, he worked as an IT consultant with Coopers & Lybrand. His experience with financial services clients eventually led to a series of positions in the finance industry, as chief information officer of Barclays Global Investors and at Visa, before he became chief technology officer at PayPal, the online payments arm of Ebay.A genial, fast-talking executive with a strong Boston accent, Mr Thompson, 54, slips easily into the standard persona of the US male. With a self-deprecating laugh, he declares himself a passionate supporter of the Red Sox baseball team and swears allegiance to all his native region’s main sports franchises, even if he and his family have long been residents of the San Francisco bay area.But behind the bonhomie is a barely disguised impatience. To the biggest question he faces – if a succession of other Yahoo bosses have failed to rekindle growth from its large online audience and strong brand, why should he do better? – he offers only his personal leadership style.Pointing to his record at PayPal, where revenues doubled during his four years in the top job, he promises he will move fast.“We got after stuff, we executed there,” he says of PayPal’s rapid expansion on his watch.After the focus on cost-cutting and profit margins of the laconic Ms Bartz, the expansive, growth-focused Mr Thompson will certainly be a change of style. Whether the result will be any better is a different question.

It either goes direct to charity or funds Sarah’s and Mr Brown’s staff for continuing public service.”The former prime minister, as an MP, is entitled to Commons expenses to maintain a handful of aides for parliamentary work. For the majority of his speeches abroad, the hosts have paid for the travel and accommodation of Mr Brown and one of his staff.David Miliband, foreign secretary in Mr Brown’s last cabinet, has earnt more than £470,000 since the election, double the prime minister’s income during the period.Mr Miliband, who lost the Labour leadership contest to his younger brother Ed, has developed a wide range of outside interests while remaining on the Labour backbenches.He has business roles including senior adviser to the VantagePoint CleanTech Advisory Council in California for up to £95,000 a year.Mr Miliband has received payments for speeches around the world, including £10,890 to address a Pakistani company, Agroventures, in Islamabad in May, and £19,258 for a lecture to the Ericsson Networked Society Forum in Hong Kong in November. In September, he received £25,027 for a week’s teaching at Stanford University in California.Lord Mandelson has set up a “strategic advice consultancy” with former aide Benjamin Wegg-Prosser called Global Counsel, part-owned by WPP.Under House of Lords rules, the former business secretary does not have to disclose his clients. Nor does Lord Mandelson have to say how much money he receives for public speaking and writing, payments for which are made to another company, Willbury Limited.Lord Hutton, former energy secretary, is now chairman of the Nuclear Industries Association. He also works as an adviser to Eversheds, the law firm, and Bechtel Corporation, a company involved in engineering, building and project management. Under Lords rules he does not have to disclose his income.Alistair Darling has made £81,000 from speeches at dinners organised by Cinven, Macquarie, Bloomberg, Bank of New York Mellon/Pershing and others. The former chancellor, who is still an MP, also received £75,000 for his memoirs, Back from the Brink.Jack Straw is paid up to £30,000 a year as a consultant to ED & F MAN Holdings, the commodity traders. The former justice secretary also is also paid for speaking engagements, book reviews and columns.The website for the company says: “We are budgeting to meet salaries, accommodation costs and staff expenses of around £550,000 a year.”The site adds that the costs of the office include “salaries and rent”, and gives its address as Broadgate Tower in the City.Calls to the reception desk at the office block are directed upstairs to Reed Smith, the law firm whose partner David Boutcher is company secretary for the Brown’s organisation. Mr Boutcher told the Financial Times that the office was based there but said he did not know how many employees it had nor whether it sublet from Reed Smith.The Labour MP supports good causes including the Jennifer Brown Institute and the PiggyBanksKids charity, which was set up by his wife.Mr Brown still pursues his interest in development aid, education and globalisation, having helped to launch the “Jobs and Justice” campaign by “Avaaz”, a global network of activists.According to the Commons’ register another £123,429 has been paid directly to charity as a result of Mr Brown’s work, including £78,289 received for a book he published at the end of last year called “Beyond the Crash”.The former prime minister’s pro bono work includes acting as chair of the “high level panel” for the Global Campaign for Education, s board member for the World Wide Web Foundation and patron of the Burma Campaign.Mr Brown’s supporters contrast his set-up with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who is paid millions through a business advisory firm, in between his charity and faith initiatives.Tony Blair Associates advises clients such as the Kuwait government and Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi investment fund.In early November, Mr Brown received a standing ovation for a speech at the World Innovation Summit in Education (Wise) in Qatar and separately warned about the fragility of the eurozone in a speech in Moscow, according to newspaper cuttings.Neither of these speeches have yet appeared in the register of interests. His spokeswoman refused to explain the apparent omission beyond saying: “Mr Brown’s entries on the register of members interests are updated fully and regularly in accordance with the rules.”The former prime minister has only spoken rarely in the House of Commons since his general election defeat.On November 30 Mr Brown spoke at length during a Commons adjournment debate about radiation risk in Dalgety Bay, Fife, within his constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. In July, during a debate on phone hacking, he made an angry attack on Rupert Murdoch and his newspaper empire.The former prime minister still carries out a regular MP’s surgery to deal with constituents’ woes. Helen Eadie, a local member of the Scottish Parliament, says Mr Brown had been “really active” in local politics and was rarely out of the local newspapers.“He’s out there visiting old people’s homes or meeting young people and any of the local companies that are in any difficulties know who to get in touch with,” she said.

Yahoo investors were unimpressed however, sending shares down 3.1 per cent to $15.78.Data storage company Netapp fell 3.1 per cent to $35.64 after a downgrade from Credit Suisse analysts, who tipped the company’s rate of market share growth to slow in 2012.Shares in Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, slumped 3.7 per cent to $97.48. The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter. However Netflix did not provide comparative figures for previous quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas climbed 7.2 per cent to $82.32 after the company raised its dividend 33 per cent to 16 cents a share and announced that it had doubled production in the Marcellus Shale during 2011. Separately, Cabot announced a two-for-one stock split.Shares of car vendor AutoNation fell 6.8 per cent to $33.26 after Edward Lampert’s ESL fund cut its stake in the company to 52.5 per cent from 56.4 per cent.

MasterCard, off 3.3 per cent to $356.25, and Visa, off 1.8 per cent to $101.15, both fell as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its buy recommendations from both stocks.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare slid 5.4 per cent to $4.69, as investors continued to fret about long-term government funding for Medicare after Citigroup downgraded the sector on Tuesday."
282;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;SMEs get chance to cash in on Olympic glory;;Small companies seeking to cash in on the Olympics normally do not get a look-in on the big sponsorship deals led by multinationals such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s.Such deals, often in the tens of millions of pounds, are simply not an option for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, Olympic organisers have for the first time created a sponsorship programme specifically for SMEs, as they seek to plug a funding gap for training British athletes.The Team 2012 programme is intended to raise private sector funding for some 1,200 British athletes, and organisers have aimed part of it at SMEs. So far 22 companies have signed up, mostly in London and the south-east, and organisers are aiming to reach 30 before the opening ceremony in July.“Its appeal is to British companies who have a strong patriotic streak and want to express their support for the team,” says Hugh Chambers, the British Olympic Association’s chief commercial officer.But handing over an average of £15,000 is a big ask for some smaller companies, many of which are focused on getting through the next few months amid gloomy economic forecasts for 2012.There also needs to be a business case for becoming a Team 2012 backer that does not rest on the emotional pull from seeing athletes in the flesh.“They’re not becoming an Olympic partner, that’s a very different thing. They’re associating with the pre-training effort but at the same time it’s part of the Olympic cycle and broader 2012 build-up,” says Mr Chambers.In return for investing in athletes’ training, SMEs receive a link to the Olympics brand, access to networking events, staff training and up to eight tickets to the games.“Some [companies] have seen it as corporate social responsibility – they think it’s a cause they buy into and look for less of a return on investment. Others say this is something we’ll leverage to engage our staff,” said Andrew Owen, one of the organisers behind Team 2012.But critics question the SME component of the programme. Almost half of Team 2012’s £25m target has come from global Olympic sponsor Visa, which doubles as the so-called presenting partner for the programme.Team 2012 has raised £16.6m since it was launched in 2009.“I’ve got mixed views,” said Simon Chadwick, professor of sports business management at Coventry University. “There is a huge amount of equity in the Olympic brand and really what SMEs can do is tap into this brand equity by associating themselves with the games.”However, he warned that any networking opportunity stemming from the programme could be a “mis-sell” because “very often such things are putting everybody in a room and you’re not actually creating links [or] delivering services … They might as well become part of a trade association.”Tim Crow, chief executive of sports marketing consultants Synergy, said Team 2012’s link to the games is “tangential at best”.He also doubts whether companies that sign up get a return on their investment. “I suspect that SMEs who create direct relationships with Olympic sports and athletes in their communities will get better value for money.”For Frank Martin, chief executive of toy maker Hornby, signing up to the programme has been worthwhile. He says Hornby is a “British company through and through”, and has a cultural link with Team 2012.Hornby was one of the first UK companies to become a London 2012 licensee, and is supplying a range of 180 items for the Games – including a replica of the red double-decker bus emblazoned with the 2012 Olympics logo, which was unveiled at the 2008 Beijing Games closing ceremony.He said the company’s link with Team 2012 and its licensing contract provide invaluable brand recognition.Team 2012 organisers are increasing their efforts to get more companies from across the UK signed up as the country enters the Olympic year.However, as Mr Chadwick says, “even [global Olympic] sponsors sometimes struggle to translate their games sponsorship into anything meaningful … that link still is essentially unproven so you’re asking people to buy into something that the jury is still out on”.
283;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Assange final extradition appeal date set;;Julian Assange, founder of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks, will get a final opportunity to avoid extradition to Sweden in relation to sexual allegations after the UK’s Supreme Court said it would hear his case.The UK’s highest court said it had granted him permission to appeal against an earlier court ruling that he should return to Sweden to face claims by two Swedish women of “non-consensual, coerced” sex. He denies the allegations.The Supreme Court hearing will take place over two days in February and is critical because it represents Mr Assange’s last chance to avoid extradition.If Mr Assange loses the case he will have exhausted his legal options in the British courts, although he could potentially appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.The Supreme Court has assigned seven justices to hear the appeal because of the great public importance of the issue that it raises – namely whether a prosecutor is a judicial authority.The decision means the Australian campaigner, who is on bail, will spend a further Christmas at Ellingham Hall, the Norfolk manor from which he has been running WikiLeaks for the past year.The decision gives fresh impetus to Mr Assange’s team after a legal battle that has dragged on for a year and comes at a critical time for WikiLeaks, which is focusing its efforts on fundraising.Mr Assange has said that the site must raise $3.5m (£2.2m) before the end of the year to continue operating, after what he called a “financial blockade” preventing payments to the group through Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and other online transaction providers.The release of thousands of US diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks last year has led to growing hostility to Mr Assange in the US.News of Mr Assange’s new court hearing comes as Bradley Manning, a US army intelligence analyst suspected of being behind the biggest leak of classified US documents in history, makes his first court appearance in a pre-trial hearing on Friday. He faces multiple charges including aiding the enemy, which could bring life imprisonment.Mr Manning is suspected of being the source of documents that last year eventually made their way to the WikiLeaks website.
284;V;Visa Inc;2011-12-08T23:49:44Z;NCC Group raises profit forecast;;NCC Group said FTSE 100 companies were spending more on keeping their networks secure, as the cybersecurity group raised its profit forecast for the year. The news sent the shares up 15 per cent on Thursday.“In times of economic strife, fraud goes up,” Rob Cotton, chief executive said, adding that companies were becoming increasingly aware of cybercrime.UK government officials have said hacking and other cyber-related crimes cost the economy £27bn a year, and a number of recent high-profile corporate hacking cases have helped to highlight the issue.In the past year Visa and MasterCard have been attacked, as well as the CIA and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. In April this year, Sony hired NCC after more than 70m user records were compromised.The Manchester-based group said it now expected pre-tax profits of between £21m and £21.5m for the year to May 2012 compared with analyst forecasts of £19.6m.It cited stronger growth in its assurance business, which tests the security of websites and carries out forensic investigations for companies that have been attacked. Mr Cotton said demand for his “ethical hacking” teams – dispatched to determine security loopholes – had grown significantly.He added that iSec, the Californian security company NCC acquired last year, was now “paying a dividend”.The company, which counts 94 of the FTSE 100 companies as clients, also said its escrow business, which holds the source codes for clients’ software, was in line with expectations.While this side of the business is higher margin, contributing over three quarters of group profit, its growth rate has slowed in the past year.“Trading in escrow is recovering,” Alex Jarvis at Peel Hunt said. Jonathan Imlah at Collins Stewart said the escrow business would continue to grow, albeit slightly less than in the first half of last year.NCC shares, which have risen by 22 per cent since the start of the year, closed up 102p at 778.5p on Thursday.
285;V;Visa Inc;2011-12-06T19:57:10Z;Mobile payment: Verizon must take care;If it appears to be forcing customers to use its own payments tool it will alienate them;"To understand the mobile phone payments gold rush, look at the volumes of the traditional payment networks. Visa processed a total of $5.8tn in payments in the past year; MasterCard had $3.1tn. Even little newcomer PayPal (owned by Ebay) handles well over $100bn a year in transactions. The potential is huge.Wireless network operators, internet companies and phone manufacturers look at numbers of that magnitude and get excited. If the mobile phone replaces credit or debit cards as the default payment tool for even a small proportion of consumers, and the companies that make this happen capture even a sliver of the value of those transactions, or add just a bit of value to them, the resulting profits will be large indeed. The idea is not to replace existing payment networks such as Visa’s, but to use smartphones on top of those networks, combining payments with coupons, Groupon-style daily deals, and other services.The first handsets with “near-field communication” chips, enabling payments with a wave of the phone, are appearing now. Every big carrier globally wants in. AT&T, T-Mobile USA and Verizon have formed a US mobile payments joint venture called Isis. Payment start-up Square raised $100m in funding this summer. Google has rolled out its “Wallet” application on Sprint’s network.There is already friction. Google disclosed on Monday that when Verizon rolls out the Nexus, an NFC-enabled Samsung handset running on Google’s software, it will not support Wallet. Verizon claims there is a hardware integration issue; Google says the Nexus is Wallet-ready. Verizon must tread carefully. The mobile payments war will be won on service quality and on the number of retail outlets at which the payments are accepted. If Verizon appears to be forcing its customers to use its own payments tool it will alienate, not profit from, them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
286;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa in Rwanda: a testing ground;;"Visa Inc is bringing cashless banking to Rwanda as it begins, a little belatedly, to target Africa’s largely unbanked emerging markets.As Elizabeth Buse, Visa’s regional president, told beyondbrics: “Visa wanted to find somewhere we could test a model for operating in emerging markets”. And Rwanda really isn’t a bad choice.Only 14 per cent of Rwandans have access to traditional forms of banking and with a GDP per capita of just $500 per year, it’s a country where transaction-volume is key. It is also a highly stable country, by African standards, and was the world’s second best reformer in 2010 according to the World Bank’s ease of doing business report. It is set to grow by 7 per cent a year up to 2013, according to Fitch, the ratings agency.Visa (V:NYQ) has been looking at breaking into African EMs for some time but knew it “would have to partner with a government”, said Buse. “We looked at a number of governments and very quickly it became clear that Rwanda was the right place to test.”Buse said there were three main things that made Rwanda particularly attractive to Visa:Visa’s partnership with the Rwandan government is codified in a “Charter of Collaboration” which sets out the commitments which both sides have taken on and as Visa notes:The partnership is a step in the Government of Rwanda’s Vision 2020 plan, the country’s blueprint to become a middle-income nation within the coming decade, with per capita income of $1000 by 2020, up from $220 in 2000. The success of that plan relies on a number of pillars, including shifting to a knowledge-based economy, private sector development and improving infrastructure.For Visa:The company’s aim to generate 50 percent of its revenue from markets outside of the United States by 2015 will partly be enabled through its ability to build, buy and deploy new technologies that extend its products to geographies where electronic payments are limited today, such as Rwanda.The agreement will enable Visa’s settlement of domestic payments in Rwandan francs, allow it to expand its network of ATMs and businesses that accept Visa’s cards in Rwanda and begin increasing financial literacy in the country.Visa sees its Rwandan experiment as an investment and “expects to make money”. The first step is get its Visa cards into the hands of ordinary Rwandans and its mobile banking platform into everyday use.Buse was quick to stress that Visa’s mobile banking model is not based on Kenya’s successful M-Pesa format (which since its launch in 2007 has garnered 15m customers and has the equivalent of up to 20 per cent of Kenya’s GDP washing through its system).She argues that Visa’s mobile platform will be unique as it will be “independent of a mobile network or branch” and “a critical part of our Rwandan experiment”.And considering that Africa had 620m mobile connections as of September 2011, according to GSM’s African Mobile report, and had overtaken Latin America to become the second largest mobile market in the world after Asia, Visa’s emphasis on mobile banking is easy to understand.Over the past 10 years, the number of mobile connections in Africa has grown by an average of 30 per cent a year and is forecast to reach 735m by the end of 2012. That, according to the report, means Africa’s mobile penetration rate is forecast to grow from 63 per cent in 2011 to 85 per cent in 2015. Mobile penetration in Rwanda is currently 40.8 per cent, according to the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency.Add that to the fact that Africa’s middle class (which is currently 75 per cent unbanked) could exceed 1bn people by 2060 (according to the African Development Bank) and the significance of Visa’s Rwandan experiment becomes clear.Related reading:

287;V;Visa Inc;2011-11-30T13:20:50Z;Battle over mobile payments intensifies;;Google, PayPal, Visa and leading mobile phone operators are all rushing to announce mobile payments services, in a battle to establish a foothold in a lucrative new market.In September, Google launched its mobile wallet service in the US, allowing people to pay for goods at stores including Bloomingdale’s, Toy’R’Us and Walgreens, by using a mobile handset equipped with a near-field communications (NFC) chip that communicates wirelessly with the cash till.Visa is preparing to launch its own digital wallet service next year, allowing users to make speedier payments online and over mobile phones, and PayPal is in negotiations with retailers to get them to accept payments from its mobile internet service in stores, a scheme expected to launch next year. Meanwhile, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile in the US are thought to be spending more than $100m on building their own mobile payments platform.In the UK, the Mobile Money Network , a mobile payments platform backed by Carphone Warehouse, was launched in November but could soon face competition from a rival platform planned by the UK’s three largest mobile operators. That is, if the mobile operator joint venture manages to clear an anti-trust complaint launched by a fourth rival operator, 3, owned by Hong Kong’s Hutchison Whampoa, this month.Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, and Telefónica, the Spanish mobile phone operator, last Thursday became the latest to announce a trial of a mobile wallet service in Spain.“There are so many announcements at the moment it feels like a land grab. Everyone is staking out their place,” says Zilvinas Bareisis, analyst at Celent, the Tokyo-based research company.It is little wonder there is a scramble, as the value of transactions made over mobile devices is estimated to be $240bn this year according to Juniper Research, growing to triple that size over the next five years.The IMRG, the research group that tracks e-commerce in the UK, expects British consumers to spend £1.64bn over mobile phones in the run-up to Christmas this year. The 2012 Olympics is expected to be an important showcase for mobile payments, with Samsung and Visa teaming up to allow visitors to pay for items in the Olympic park with a wave of an NFC-enabled handset.Analysts at Forrester, the US-based research company, have predicted that by 2016 consumers may be able to leave their traditional leather wallet at home and pay for most of their shopping over their handset.“It is really basic but it does what it is supposed to do. You just pass the phone in front of the terminal, and when you have made the payment it shows you a little receipt on your screen, which is quite nice,” says Digantam Gurung, analyst at CCS Insight, the research group, who has been among the first to start using Orange’s QuickTap payment system in the UK.It is unclear, however, which of the competing mobile wallet propositions is likely to prevail and Mr Bareisis warns that this is causing confusion among retailers.“For merchants who have to invest in these technologies, the choice is quite staggering and slowing down adoption as they wait to see which is likely to win,” Mr Bareisis says.“Lots of people are trying lots of things to see what works. Below the surface of all the propositions it is about partnerships being formed, putting the connectivity in place,” says Alastair Lukies, chief executive of Monitise, a UK company that provides software for a number of mobile banking platforms, as well as the Mobile Money Network.Visa, for example, is a partner in most of the initiatives, licensing its own electronic payments technology to Google and taking a strategic stake in Monitise, to ensure that it has a position in whichever the winning platform or platforms turn out to be.“Nobody can really say for certain what this space will look like in five years’ time. Is there a threat of being left out? Absolutely. We are making sure we are in place with the right partnerships. We have our finger in a lot of pies,” says Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile development at Visa Europe.Analysts expect NFC technology to be a cornerstone of mobile payments, with the simplicity of paying with a single tap of the phone appealing to users.But consumers still have a certain amount of mistrust about NFC. Mr Gurung of CCS Insight says that although stores such as McDonald’s and UK sandwich bar Eat have installed contactless terminals, staff were often still confused when he used his phone to pay.“I think I have only been in one shop so far where they knew what I was doing. Usually they look at me as if I am a bit strange when I pull the phone out.”A recent survey by Gemalto, the smartcard company, showed that nearly half of UK consumers feared that if an NFC-equipped phone was lost or stolen a thief could quickly rack up a fortune in transactions.There are also still very few phones on the market with NFC capability, one of the reasons the Mobile Money Network, for example, does not use it. At the moment Samsung’s Galaxy Nexus phones are the only NFC-enabled handsets selling in volume. However, a number of new NFC phones are expected to come on to the market in 2012 from BlackBerry, Nokia and HTC.Companies are also still negotiating how to share mobile payments revenues and, crucially, who has control over customer data. This is where the real potential of mobile payments is expected to be, with revenues earned by the mobile phone operators and banks from serving targeted advertising and offers to mobile users.“The payments industry is traditionally low margin, therefore the real value lies in enriching the transaction itself. Loyalty cards and couponing provide a unique opportunity to understand in real time what the consumer is doing,” says Fred Huet, the UK-based managing director of Greenwich Consulting, the research company.
288;V;Visa Inc;2011-11-29T18:36:52Z;WPP acquires Glover Park Group;Group said to have $60m in annual revenues;Advertising group WPP has bought a Washington-based communications firm that is advising News Corp on its handling of the phone hacking scandal.The Glover Park Group was founded in 2001 by a group of well-connected Democrats including Joe Lockhart, president Bill Clinton’s former press secretary.It has grown to 140 employees with offices in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and has branched out to hire several Republicans as well. It was brought in to assist Rupert Murdoch’s company at the height of the hacking scandal this summer, and will become the latest politically focused firm to become a part of Sir Martin Sorrell’s advertising group.Terms of the sale were not released, but Glover Park Group is said to have $60m in annual revenues. WPP said the deal was subject to regulatory approval.WPP last year bought Blue State Digital, the digital agency that led Barack Obama’s groundbreaking online fundraising campaign during the 2008 presidential election. In 2006 WPP acquired Public Strategies, another Washington firm, and the Dewey Square Group, a public affairs firm with deep roots in the Democratic party.The Dewey Square acquisition has proved an occasional liability for WPP, with the Department of Justice investigating apparently forged letters sent out by one of the company’s contractors in a campaign to influence proposed trading rules. Dewey Square said it had been unaware that the letters were “unauthorised”. And it has at times found itself working against other WPP business units, such as its 2007 gun rights fight against Ogilvy Government Relations. Such instances have revealed the depth of WPP’s ties on Capitol Hill, where spending on lobbying, public relations and political advertising is booming.Carter Eskew, a founding partner of Glover Park Group released a statement to Politico, a US-based news site. “I’m fiercely proud of what we have built over the past 10 years and the impact we’ve had on the industry,” he said. “But I’m even more excited about what lies ahead. WPP is an ideal partner for the next chapter in the GPG story.”And while Mr Eskew will stay on with WPP for the foreseeable future, not all of the Glover Park Group’s founders are still with the firm. Mr Lockhart joined Facebook in June to help the world’s largest social network establish its lobbying presence on Capitol Hill.On its website the Glover Park Group says: “Old lines between public and private sector, journalist and civilian, outside agitator and inside power broker are blurring.” Clients include Visa, Pfizer, Verizon Wireless and the American Postal Workers Union.

Its shares ended the day unchanged at $187.The move further vindicates the strategy adopted by Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, who will step down next month after nine years in which he transformed the company from a hardware manufacturer into an IT services and consulting specialist.Mr Buffett had previously avoided the sector, saying he did not understand tech companies or their products well enough to take large stakes.Under Mr Palmisano, IBM has provided a level of disclosure rare for such a large public company. It intends to generate operating earnings per share of at least $20 by 2015, while spending $20bn on acquisitions between 2011 and 2015.Last month,IBM reported $26.2bn in third-quarter revenues, with most of the growth coming from emerging markets. It also forecast full-year profits of $13.35 per share, up 14 per cent year on year.Since 2000, the company has disposed of commodity businesses, including its PC and hard-drive divisions, and increased software’s earnings contribution from 25 to 44 per cent last year. Software is expected to account for half of IBM’s business by 2015.IBM recently announced that Ginni Rometty will succeed Mr Palmisano from the start of next year, making her IBM’s first female chief executive.Speaking ahead of Berkshire’s disclosure of its equity holdings, Mr Buffett added that he was not investing in European banks as he did not feel he knew enough about the industry and had not come across an interesting investment opportunity.The company later disclosed five new investments made during the quarter. At the end of September Berkshire owned stakes valued between $195m and $232m in Intel, drug store chain CVS Caremark, broadcaster DirecTV, Visa, and defence group General Dynamics.Mr Buffett also sold about a 10th of his holdings of Kraft Foods and Johnson & Johnson during the quarter, leaving Berkshire with positions worth $3.2bn and $2.4bn respectively.

291;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa warms to jump in LatAm card growth;;Credit and debit cards payments in Brazil are expected to grow at rates in the “mid-20 per cent levels” for the foreseeable future, according to Visa, the world’s largest payment processing company.The increase is being driven by the growing number of people joining the middle-class in Latin America’s biggest economy coupled with increasing formal employment and internet use, said William Sheedy, group president for the Americas of Visa.“The combination of high growth and sustainability not to mention the size of the Brazilian economy – it’s a bit of a triple play,” Mr Sheedy said.Brazil and other Latin American countries have become one of the most promising new frontiers for payment-processing companies led by Visa and MasterCard at a time when their core US and European markets are slowing down.Visa reported a 40 per cent surge in quarterly profit in the three months to the end of June while MasterCard said net profit had risen 32.8 per cent during the same period, helped by a rise in their global businesses, including in Brazil.Billing volumes using cards in Brazil increased 22 per cent last year to R$541.9bn (US$309.2bn) compared to a year earlier while the number of cards in circulation rose 11 per cent to 628m, according to the Brazilian association of credit card and services companies.The association predicts that the volume of transactions will increase 18.6 per cent this year after growing annually between 2000 and 2010 at 23 per cent.“The increase in bank account penetration and credit, higher personal spending, increasing consumer acceptance of credit cards, and movement to a more formal marketplace are the main drivers that should support rapid growth of the market,” Fitch said in a report earlier this year on Redecard, the Brazilian credit card company.Electronic payment penetration remains low in Brazil at about 30 per cent of transactions compared with about 60 per cent in the US, Visa’s Mr Sheedy said.Visa’s payment volumes in Brazil, the amount of transactions directly paid for using its cards, was about US$200bn.But consumers were also using Visa cards to withdraw an additional $300bn in cash from automatic teller machines, which they then used to pay for transactions.Converting this additional $300m into transactions paid for electronically with cards rather than cash represented a tangible near-term opportunity, Mr Sheedy said.“When you look at the total Brazilian economy which is just around US$2,100bn, it’s a place that for far into the future is going to continue to drive strong double-digit growth rates,” he said.Brazilian consumer defaults have risen steadily this year in line with an increase in interest rates. But Mr Sheedy said these trends were not expected to affect Visa’s margins, which mostly depend on transaction volume rather than trends in credit quality.
292;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
293;V;Visa Inc;2011-11-03T22:28:43Z;Consumers to reclaim personal information;;Consumers will soon be able to reclaim their personal information from banks, telecoms providers, utilities and other companies, to help them learn about their consumption habits and switch for better deals.Under the Midata scheme put forward by the government, dozens of businesses are expected to make customer data available in a standardised, reusable digital format by early next year.They include banks such as RBS and Lloyds, utilities such as British Gas, EDF and Scottish Power, credit firms such as Callcredit, MasterCard and Visa, and internet companies Three, Google and Moneysupermarket.com.Ctrl-Shift, a consultancy on consumer empowerment which has been advising the government, estimates that the companies’ combined customer base amounts to about 20m people.For example, a money management service could be created without having to share online banking passwords with a third party, allowing analysis of spending on groceries or links to price-comparison sites.“We believe if we can pull this off, it has huge growth potential for our economy and for British businesses,” said Ed Davey, employment minister. “There are many service providers across business sectors who increasingly have personal data on individual citizens but it’s not a data relationship that’s balanced. The ability of citizens to access that data are limited.”Nigel Shadbolt, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton and an adviser to the prime minister on data issues, including opening up public-sector information, added: “We believe this is a new kind of environment that promises absolutely new kinds of services.”Ctrl-Shift believes that industries will emerge to help manage personal data, aggregate information to help consumers manage their lives better, and help them make better decisions.Few such companies currently exist. One example is Billmonitor, a partner in the Midata initiative which obtains information about phone bills by “scraping” information from websites. “That’s a huge amount of effort with needless amounts of friction,” said Mr Shadbolt.Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, an internet freedom campaign group, warned against potential abuses of the newly-freed personal information.“Getting your data back is good,” he said. “But Midata must be accompanied by a stronger Data Protection Act, with a right to delete your data, or consumers could be victims of parasitic data or finance companies tempting people to share more than is good for them.”Mr Davey said that he hoped greater transparency would foster trust between businesses and consumers, which is “not as great as it may have been a few years ago”.The Midata initiative, though not enforced by regulation, set out nine principles, such as using standardised formats, secure storage, and a licence for unrestricted reuse of personal data.In the coming months, partner companies will develop “personal data inventories” detailing what information is available about each customer and set out privacy and security protocols. The first data are expected to be released by the middle of 2012.
294;V;Visa Inc;2011-11-02T23:50:47Z;MasterCard reports strong growth;;MasterCard reported strong revenue growth in the third quarter as chief executive Ajay Banga said “we are still seeing the consumers spend” in spite of sluggish economic growth in the US and worries that Europe will fall into recession.Revenue rose 27 per cent year on year to $1.8bn, the company said on Wednesday, with net income up 38.4 per cent at $717m and earnings per share 43 per cent higher at $5.63.“We are really not seeing any significant impact on our numbers on what’s going on [in the global economy] even in the US or in many countries in Europe,” said Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer.Mr Banga acknowledged that inflation played a part in the increased US revenues in the three months to the end of September but he also pointed to a 22 per cent increase in debit card volumes in the US as consumers preferred plastic to cash and MasterCard persuaded banks, including SunTrust to adopt the company as its card payment network rather than Visa. The US accounts for a third of the company’s transactions by volume.Even if the economic picture darkens, MasterCard said it should still benefit from the long-term move from cash to electronic forms of payment. “Eighty-five per cent of the world’s transactions are still in cash,” said Ms Hund-Mejean. “That is a real piece of work that we are going after. You can see that as a huge opportunity that will last us for many many years to come.”But company executives also suggested that the sharp increase in revenue and profits might not be matched next year. They said they were sticking to a pledge for operating margin to be at 50 per cent, even though it rose to 55 per cent in the third quarter.The company faces regulatory challenges in the US, where last year’s Dodd-Frank Act caps the fees charged to retailers for processing debit card transactions. But analysts said that Visa, a much bigger player in US debit, had the most to lose.“There are still a lot of moving pieces in the US debit landscape,” said Mr Banga. “We are in a completely different competitive situation from others in the debit space and do not have the need to defend a large incumbent position.”The company also set aside $500m for lawsuits by retailers alleging price fixing. “At this time, it is not possible to put an upper limit on this loss due to the significantly higher demands by the class plaintiffs, which are unacceptable to MasterCard,” said Mr Banga.Shares in the company rose 7.4 per cent by midday in New York. The stock is up 60 per cent this year compared with a 30-60 per cent decline for some of the biggest US banks.
295;V;Visa Inc;2011-10-30T21:07:53Z;Big US brands tap into online discount sector;;Big US brands are striking more deals with online discount sites Groupon and LivingSocial in an evolving symbiotic relationship that helps discount companies combat customer fatigue with new, compelling offers, and helps large conglomerates reach more than 150m new potential customers.Typically the turf of small, local family-run shops just a year ago, daily deal sites are increasingly being recognised by national brands as a marketing channel and customer tracking system that warrant exploration.“At the store level and at the geographic level, this makes brands much smarter about who their customers really are,” said Jed Williams, an analyst with BIA/Kelsey. “Whether it’s Groupon delivering that in five years or not, that’s an aside to what group buying has done to move customers to the cash register. Brands understand there’s nothing faddish about that.”Historically, large brands have had the upper hand in negotiations with daily deal companies, often paying little to no share of the deals. The discount companies shouldered the expense as customer acquisition costs, because the brand recognition helped attract and retain new subscribers.But Mitch Spolan, head of national sales for LivingSocial, said that dynamic was changing.“The secret about us is that we say ‘no’ more than we say ‘yes’,” he said.From American Apparel to Whole Foods to Unilever, more and more national brands are using Groupon or LivingSocial to target particular geographic areas where customer numbers are low, or to move inventory in a typically slow quarter.“We’ve evolved our conversation with national partners from education and awareness to really tactical execution to how we can best leverage this platform,” said Lee Brown, head of national sales for Groupon.Some brands are not running deals at all but rather tapping into the companies’ huge customer databases – Groupon’s just topped 142m subscribers– to experiment with new marketing campaigns.For example, Visa customers in Atlanta who had bought a LivingSocial voucher were offered a second voucher to give to a friend if they agreed to switch the credit card they had on file with LivingSocial to a Visa card, a consumer choice that is usually very difficult to influence.Microsoft ran a campaign targeted at wealthy educated women who bought family-orientated deals from LivingSocial. After the women had made their purchase, Microsoft offered them $5 to use on future deals in exchange for watching a video about how mothers can use Windows 7 to run their households.“We wanted to see how we could use Groupon and LivingSocial to extend our existing marketing efforts,” said Marty Collins, director of emerging media at Microsoft. “It was a very successful campaign for us, compared to other campaigns in more traditional channels.”
296;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa reports jump in credit-card spending;Company surpasses expectations with 14% rise;Visa, the world’s largest electronic payments company, reported better than expected fourth-quarter earnings as credit-card spending jumped.The San Francisco-based company reported a 14 per cent increase in net income to $880m for the three months to September 30, or $1.27 a share, beating consensus forecasts of $1.25 a share.The company said it saw the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in its US credit-card business, driven by affluent cardholders. Its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $92.02 by the market close in New York.“Visa continues to deliver strong results, with fourth-quarter and full-year performance reflecting a business that is both resilient and flexible enough to adapt and flourish in a changing business environment,” said Joseph Saunders, chairman and chief executive.“We have been diligent in our efforts to grow our core business, while successfully unlocking new revenue opportunities through strategic investments, both in our core business and into innovations that will ensure our foundation for future growth remains strong,” he said.Mr Saunders also announced a $1bn increase in its share repurchase programme.Operating revenue in the fourth quarter stood at $2.4bn, a 13 per cent increase from the previous year. Net income for the full year to September 2011 was $3.6bn, inclusive of the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. Net operating revenue for the year was $9.2bn, an increase of 14 per cent year on year, driven by double-digit revenue growth from service, data processing and international transaction revenues.The positive earnings came as US regulators put a cap on so-called swipe fees that companies such as Visa, and its rival MasterCard, can charge merchants for each debit-card purchase made.Visa and MasterCard have been grappling over regulations on debit-card transactions that prevent banks from setting exclusive deals with payment networks. As of October 1, the Federal Reserve capped debit fees at 21 cents per swipe, higher than the 12 cents proposed by regulators. It is thought that the rules may limit processors’ revenues, increasing the importance of the industry’s shift towards electronic and mobile payments.The company said it was too early to comment on debit transaction volume changes as a result of the new rules.For the full year of 2011, service revenues increased 22 per cent year on year to $4.3bn, while data processing revenues rose 11 per cent to $3.5bn. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border payment volume, grew 17 per cent over the previous year to $2.7bn.Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet for the year to September, totalled 51bn, a 12 per cent increase year on year.Visa, which generated about 59 per cent of revenues from the US in the 2010 fiscal year, aims to generate more than half its earnings from international markets by 2015.The company affirmed its 2012 financial outlook, saying that it expects high single to low double-digit net revenue growth for the next year. Visa announced a 47 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend payment to 22 cents a share on October 19.
297;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;WikiLeaks suspends publishing to raise money;;Julian Assange has declared that WikiLeaks, the whistleblowing site he founded, must suspend its publishing operations to raise funds to prevent bankruptcy by the end of the year.The site has been fighting what it calls a “financial blockade” after payment firms and banks including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Bank of America stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks in December last year.Mr Assange said that this now posed an “existential threat” to WikiLeaks’ work, arguing that it had deprived the organisation of tens of millions of euros in funding.“In order to ensure our future survival, WikiLeaks is now forced to temporarily suspend all publishing operations in order to direct all our resources into fighting the blockade and raising funds,” Mr Assange told a press conference at the Frontline Club, a private members’ club for journalists in central London.“If WikiLeaks does not find a way to remove this blockade, given our current levels of expenditure, we will simply not be able to continue by the turn of the year.”WikiLeaks needs $3.5m (€2.5m) to continue operating for the next 12 months, Mr Assange said, with dozens more leaks yet to be published.Donations to WikiLeaks spiked when it first published its revelations, including the files from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and a cache of 250,000 US diplomatic cables.In 2010, the average donation to WikiLeaks each month exceeded €100,000. But in the first nine months of 2011, average donations have mostly been between €6,000 and €7,000. WikiLeaks blames the shortfall on the blockade, although the period has also seen Mr Assange fighting claims of sexual assault in Sweden.Mr Assange, who has always denied the allegations and is awaiting a British court’s ruling on Swedish authorities’ attempts to extradite him to Stockholm for further questioning, said that WikiLeaks donations were never used to fund his legal battle.Over the summer, WikiLeaks and Datacell, the Icelandic payment processing firm it used, filed a complaint to the European Commission over financial companies’ actions.WikiLeaks had hoped that the situation would have rectified itself by now. It intends to turn to other sources of funding.“We hope to put together a constellation of wealthy individuals from different nations so we are able to keep our political independence, together with a broad mass appeal using alternative [funding] mechanisms,” Mr Assange said.The financial services’ firms actions against WikiLeaks raise issues of freedom of speech and could threaten the work of charities such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International, he added. “These few companies cannot be permitted to arbitrarily decide how the whole world votes with its wallet.”Mr Assange also told reporters on Monday that WikiLeaks would provide a new secure method to leak documents next month, declaring that it was “not possible to trust” existing online submission systems.He pointed to the recent case of DigiNotar, a Dutch company selling certificates to authenticate sensitive websites such as banking or email, which was infiltrated by Iranian intelligence agencies, as an example of the lack of security inherent in today’s internet.“A number of certificate authorities are in effective state control, they are run directly by branches of the state,” he said. “It is not possible to trust any regular web-based encryption system.”WikiLeaks has had to re-engineer its own submission system “from scratch” because it “could not be trusted”, Mr Assange said. For the last 12 months, all WikiLeaks submissions have been made in person rather than through its website.“On November 28, we will launch our new-generation submission system,” he said. “That includes not just a public interface but also several other mechanisms that are necessary to deal with an attack on the entire internet security system that has been established over the past few years by intelligence agencies and criminal groups.”
298;V;Visa Inc;2011-10-19T17:59:29Z;Index and Charles Dunstone buy into iZettle, the European Square;;Carphone Warehouse co-founder Charles Dunstone and Index Ventures have invested €8.2m ($11.2m) in iZettle, Europe’s answer to mobile-payment firm Square.Sweden’s iZettle operates a payment system for small or nomadic merchants – be they market traders, window cleaners or conference-goers – through a card reader that attaches to the bottom of an iPhone.Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s other start-up, Square, requires the swipe of a magnetic card for its iPhone payment terminal. It is already processing a run rate of $2bn worth of payments a year through 800,000 merchants, raising $100m at a reported $1bn valuation in June.But iZettle’s backers still think it can steal a march in Europe because its payment system works with chip-and-pin credit cards – which are rare in the US but predominant in much of the rest of the world.Chip and pin is more secure but also more complicated. iZettle has nailed not only the hardware and the payment process but also obtained relevant regulatory clearance in its native Sweden, of which there is a more than a little. It is compliant with EMV (the Europay, MasterCard and VISA card approval body) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).“It’s really democratising the payment terminal. Part of what they are doing is making a much lower-cost device by leveraging the screen and computing power of the phone,” said Ben Holmes, the Index partner who is joining iZettle’s board.“It’s absolutely not trivial what the company has done [so far] but we have to delight consumers and merchants to make it a successful business.”Pricing will help with at least part of that. Credit card machines by incumbents Verifone and Ingenico require both upfront investment and fixed monthly costs, making them too expensive for sole traders with lower volumes of sales. iZettle is giving away its terminals (for now, at least) and has no ongoing overheads beyond a 2.75 per cent commission and €0.16 fixed fee per transaction.However, the traditional players aren’t standing still: Ingenico are already working on their own iPad attachment and Verifone is working with Google Wallet, an NFC-based mobile payments service.iZettle’s press release provides the obligatory customer quote from a Mexican food truck in Stockholm (which feels more San Francisco than Scandinavia) but average transaction values are approaching €100.iZettle plans to use the funds for expansion into the rest of Europe. To that end, it has a strong ally in Charles Dunstone, the British entrepreneur behind the Carphone Warehouse mobile-phone retailer and TalkTalk broadband provider.“When I started Carphone Warehouse [in 1989], the people who had mobile phones were the people who had small businesses – so this feels like it’s going full circle and giving those people the ability to take payment by credit card wherever they are,” Mr Dunstone told the FT.“It transforms those small businesses where otherwise you’re relying on your customer to pay you, getting a cheque or having to take cash… It’s a very inefficient process for a self-employed, mobile workforce.”Mr Dunstone isn’t one of the UK’s most prolific early-stage investors but recently joined Index in investing in Funding Circle, an online “peer-to-peer” lending marketplace which promises to speed up borrowing for small businesses feeling the squeeze from traditional banks.He sees common ground between the two start-ups.“If you look at the economy at the moment, [one of] the areas where there are real inefficiencies – and it’s all quite opaque to customers – is financial services,” Mr Dunstone said.In the UK, he’s already invested in Mobile Money Network, a home payments system for consumers using near-field communication, along with mobile banking provider Monitise. “We’ve always thought that the mobile networks or the banks would somehow own mobile payments. I’m increasingly getting the sense that it’s actually going to come from innovative start-ups rather than existing players – the people that just get on and solve problems rather than being overwhelmed by them.”
299;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;Long wait to get mobile money moving;;"Alastair Lukies’ rugby player frame shifts forward as he gestures at his outdated Sony Ericsson mobile phone. “I’m genuinely not fascinated by technology,” he says. “I’m not a techie at all.”The self-described “simpleton” cuts a self-effacing figure in his City of London office. Yet there is little false modesty on show when the subject shifts to Monitise, the company he started nine years ago. Four years after it listed in London, Monitise is yet to record a profit, but he bullishly predicts it will be a global force in the fast-growing mobile money industry.“Since 2002, I’ve been out walking the streets, saying to people that one day the 5.9bn mobile phones on the planet will be the way that people manage their money,” from managing a bank account to paying for the groceries, says the 37-year-old. “It’s so obvious, but it just takes time for people to catch up.”Monitise’s market capitalisation, at about £250m, has risen more than 100 per cent in the past two years and values the company at eight times this year’s forecast revenue. Thanks to its strategy of continued heavy investment in technology and a focus on developing a global presence, Monitise does not expect to break even until 2013. But the global market for mobile payments is forecast to be worth $670bn by 2015, according to Juniper Research.Monitise’s operations in the UK and the US are already profitable, but it is ploughing the proceeds into expansion elsewhere – a long-term strategy that has the support of big shareholders such as Visa, Standard Chartered and Norges Bank. “Jeff Bezos at Amazon always said, ‘We are prepared to be misunderstood for many years, bec­ause we know we’re building a long-term, high-value company,’” says Mr Lukies. “If you go to the US, everyone expects that companies like Amazon will have years when they’re not profitable while they’re building the infrastructure.”Some analysts believe Mr Lukies’ confidence is well placed. Mark James, at Liberum Capital, who res­earches the global mobile payments sector, says Monitise has achieved a wider reach geographically than its peers, and that the popularity of a new generation of smartphones means the long decade of investment is set to pay off.“We finally have handsets that make new business models in mobile possible,” he says.Monitise runs mobile banking platforms for more than 250 banks, inc­luding most of the biggest in Britain. It is expanding its presence in emerging markets such as India and Nigeria, where traditional banking models have failed to reach the vast majority of the population, but which represent a huge potential market. “To say that you’re the world leader in something is quite a bold call,” Mr Lukies acknowledges. “[But] it’s our religion – we understand it.”Despite this evangelical fervour, Mr Lukies was a late convert. The son of a farmer, he left school at 16 with a handful of GCSE exams to pursue a life in professional rugby. “I don’t think that’s because I was dumb – it’s just because I was in a rush,” he says.Mr Lukies’ sporting career began well, with stints at Saracens and London Irish, and a move to Australia. Then, after a multiple leg fracture ended his rugby career in 1995, he went home to find his parents’ marriage at an end, and his father nearly ruined by the Lloyd’s of London crash. “I came back with no farm to fund my rugby playing, and [in no physical state] to play it,” he says. “Suddenly you’re sleeping in the back of a Ford Fiesta at the train station and can’t afford a train ticket.”He worked in corporate hospitality, and got a first taste of emerging markets organising packages for the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. “It was the worst economic downturn in Asia’s history … there were riots on the streets. The expat lifestyle is nowhere near as glamorous as everyone thinks it is. It’s just bloody hard work,” he says.Back in England, Mr Lukies helped set up Epolitix.com, a news portal covering Westminster politics. This brought networking opportunities that would prove useful.The third-generation mobile spectrum auction in 2000 brought Mr Lukies together with Steve Atkinson at Vodafone, which was keen to tell MPs about the benefits it could bring consumers through 3G. “Steve was a real visionary … He said: ‘What is the one thing that will affect every person for their entire life? It’s money.’”Inspired by the UK’s Link network of ATMs, Mr Lukies and Mr Atkinson set out to build a mobile money system that would be compatible with any financial institution, but with “50m mobile ATMs”. In 2003, they set up Monitise as a unit within the technology group Morse.Do:
●Explain your vision to people you trust, and accept their criticisms. “A lot of entrepreneurs feel they have a fantastic idea, but no one else gets it. If that’s the case, it’s probably not that great.”
●Be prepared to dilute your holdings: “Five per cent of a big number is better than 100 per cent of nothing.”
●Bring in talent and experience. “Surround yourself with people much smarter than you – as many good advisers and experienced people as you can find.”

Don’t:
●Expect immediate rewards. “Don’t kid yourself that success happens overnight.”
●Get distracted by rivals. “It’s important to understand and analyse the competition, but don’t spend your time worrying about what everyone else is doing.”
●Keep things to yourself. “Trust your team – building your business is a team game.”The eventual listing on Aim raised £21.4m, but the credit crisis sent the shares plunging from the float price of 22p to a low of 2p in January 2009. “Lots of people were saying: ‘You shouldn’t be a public company,’” Mr Lukies says. But support from big shareholders stiffened his resolve, and the share price recovered sharply that summer as Monitise announced it had signed a five-year exclusive contract with Visa, which also bought a 14 per cent stake in the company.In October 2009, Monitise signed up its millionth customer – the figure is now more than 4.5m users, carrying out 120m transactions a year using the company’s software.David Cameron, prime minister, included Mr Lukies in a trade mission to Africa in July this year, and Monitise won a licence from Nigeria’s central bank in August.M-Pesa, a Kenyan mobile money platform run by Vodafone affiliate Safaricom, has attracted millions of users and global attention. But Monitise is based on a different system. Its “bank-grade” security and monitoring system al­low regulators to track cash flows, which enables the revenue services to tax transactions. “What you don’t want is a shadow economy of cash moving into a shadow economy of mobile,” says Mr
Lukies. “We’ve created hundreds of new jobs in Nigeria and we’ve got consumers who are building credit histories for the first time in their lives.”Yet he seems wary of painting the business as geared just towards emerging markets. Closer to home, Monitise has secured Sir Stuart Rose, former head of retailer Marks and Spencer, to chair Mobile Money Network, a joint venture with Carphone Warehouse founder Charles Dunstone.The service, to be launched this year, will allow users to order items for home delivery by typing a short code into their device. It aims eventually to take advantage of near-field communication technology, whereby a microchip allows shoppers to pay for goods by tapping their handset on an electronic reader.Mr Lukies believes that the mobile phone will replace the credit card. “The card doesn’t give you anything back … You go ‘beep’; you can’t check if you need to move money between accounts, you can’t get a special offer sent to your card,” he says.Monitise’s international pre­sence and flexibility to work with any handset or financial institution make it an “intimidating” competitor for potential rivals, says Mr James. But when one rival is Google, which has made mobile money a “top three” priority, no one can be complacent. It is perhaps little surprise that speculation about a take­over of Monitise is not uncommon.To Mr Lukies, however, the only certainty is the impending explosion in the mobile money market. “There’s an inevitability to the 2.2bn bank cards in the world all being accessed via the mobile phone within the next 10 years,” he says."
300;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;They’re watching. And they can bring you down;Why the world is scared of hacktivists;"It took more than being arrested at his home in the Netherlands by a swarm of police officers to shake 19-year-old Martijn Gonlag’s faith in Anonymous, an amorphous cyber-collective that has terrorised law enforcement and leading companies on five continents.Gonlag, who lives in Hoogezand-Sappemeer, 100 miles north-east of Amsterdam, was interrogated for two days last year before being released pending a trial that could send him to jail for six years. But the college student stood by his decision to download attack software and participate in 2010’s electronic assaults on the websites of Visa, MasterCard and others that had stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks as it published secret diplomatic cables. “WikiLeaks hasn’t been charged, but they were being worked against by governments and companies. That wasn’t right,” Gonlag told the Financial Times.The state of technology security overall is so weak that intelligence officials see hacking as one of the largest threats to western powers. While their top concern is nation-backed attacks, the lines between protesters, criminals and spies can be hard to discern. Gonlag is one of thousands who have joined an unprecedented wave of what has been dubbed “hacktivism”, referring to the combination of computer hacking with political activism. The largest and best known of these groups is Anonymous, a virtual mob that makes it easy for people with little technological aptitude to participate in protests, many of them illegal.The increasingly likely threat of apprehension isn’t enough to dissuade many Anonymous supporters from what they compare with “sit-ins” – conscious acts of trespassing that inconvenience their targets while bringing the underlying issues to wider attention. Yet though such dedication persists even after dozens of recent arrests in the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere, there are signs that Anonymous is being torn apart from the inside. Internal feuds thus might finish the job that law enforcement – infuriated by attacks on the CIA, FBI and US defence contractors – has barely begun.The most important split is between the leadership and the rank and file. Gonlag underwent his own change of heart when he watched an administrator in an Anonymous chat channel encourage a minor to download the same software that had led to his weekend behind bars. The old hand told the teenager that he wasn’t in danger because the attack tool would mask his internet address.“LOL,” Gonlag typed in the chat channel, for “laughing out loud”. He meant it as a warning born of hard-won experience. But the administrator immediately shot him a private message: “Shut the f*** up.” “That showed to me they are trying to use kids to do their dirty work,” Gonlag recalled. “That’s when the tide turned and I left Anonymous.”To admirers, the hacktivism trend reflects the increased importance of technology in more and more aspects of life. The net is now democratising both legitimate political expression and hacking in the same way it once democratised media, allowing anyone to blog or publish an electronic book.But others, including the companies that have lost business due to web outages or been robbed of customer information by hacktivists, believe Anonymous sets a dangerous precedent. “Motivation-wise, I think these guys are on a massive power trip. There is definitely some criminal element,” says Karim Hijazi, founder of tech security start-up Unveillance, which had its internal e-mails published by hackers with Lulz Security (commonly known as LulzSec), an Anonymous offshoot.Even some supporters worry that if the group continues on its current path, it could trigger a legislative backlash that would bring heightened monitoring at the expense of the privacy that Anonymous prizes.Steven Chabinsky, FBI deputy assistant director, says the bureau is placing “a lot of emphasis and focus on Anonymous and other groups that would be like them. These organisations have managed to use new technologies to connect to otherwise disenfranchised hackers to gather force and momentum in a way we have not seen before.” Since July, the FBI’s most useful ally has been Scotland Yard and its beefed-up e-Crime unit, which says it has arrested three of the four founders of LulzSec.…Anonymous began as a small group protesting internet censorship, using novel ways designed to grab press attention. As idealists swelled the ranks, though, its unusually open and officially leaderless structure allowed it to be penetrated by cyber criminals and career hackers, who launched direct attacks on law enforcement. This was a long way from the chatter on teen-oriented message boards inside the 4chan website, which was founded in 2003. (The name “Anonymous” comes from the identity given by default to anyone posting comments there.)These message boards were all about ephemera, with pictures or other material disappearing automatically after a short period. But some items caught the imaginations of enough people in the nameless crowd that they spread to the rest of the web world. The boards were the take-off point for the annotated cat pictures known as LOLcats and for the prank that tricked people into clicking on links to singer Rick Astley’s 1987 song “Never Gonna Give You Up” – the infamous “rickrolling”.Little on 4chan was political and anyone trying to do something positive risked being tagged as a self-righteous “moral fag”, as the lingo had it. Still, given the off-colour taste of many of the 4chan items posted, internet censorship naturally hit a nerve.It was the Church of Scientology, which had a history of using copyright laws to go after critics and suppress internal documents, that was the catalyst for transforming Anonymous from online hangout to activist power. The process took less than a fortnight.In January 2008, 4chan visitors and others passed around a YouTube video of Tom Cruise talking about Scientology. Ignoring the maxim that, on the internet, squashing something makes it bigger, the church served YouTube with a copyright warning and got the video taken down. This offended 4chan regulars such as Gregg Housh, an anti-establishment website programmer.A debate began over what to do. One suggestion was that since YouTube videos are often downloaded and reposted, the group should look out for a repost and grab a copy for distribution to other sites. It did just that, adding text naming another internet chat that viewers could join to plot next steps. More than 50 people signed in. Some suggested an answering video, with a digitised voice reading a press release where “Anonymous” declared “war” on Scientology. As Housh and his online peers put the finishing touches to the press release, someone suggested the ominous tagline: “Expect Us”. Housh loved it. “You win!” he shouted.Housh, who is now 34, thought the video would last for a week or so before new people stopped watching. “This is the internet,” he shrugs. But the online tech tabloid The Register found the fresh imagery and tone irresistible, embedding the video on its front page. High-traffic gossip site Gawker followed and then came cable channel CNN.The chat channel grew so crowded with new participants that communication was close to impossible – the messages scrolled too quickly up the screen. Housh dispersed the flock to new channels for every big city and set up a secret one for core organisers to thrash through plans to keep the movement going.The group held real-world demonstrations in front of Scientology churches. In keeping with the nameless spirit of their movement and to guard against lawsuits, they picked a uniform disguise – Guy Fawkes masks like those used in the movie V for Vendetta. Thousands appeared at the appointed hour and Anonymous took on new life as an outward-facing social force. And the more its members intersected with other activists, the more they thought about where internet freedom was imperilled on the world stage.Anonymous’s attention on Scientology flagged but participants put up a website, WhyWeProtest, to explain their reasoning on net censorship and related issues.After the suspect Iranian elections in 2009, local activists appeared and asked how to organise online without being caught by the government’s surveillance techniques. Housh and his colleagues coached them with the best research they could find. At one point he was speaking to five activists inside Iran. Then came days of silence before one got back in touch using the code word. The other four were dead, he said, and he wouldn’t be in contact again.Housh was shattered. So much for the fun and games. “I’m done,” he said. Anonymous would play a role in the Arab uprisings that began in December 2010, but he and others merely provided resources instead of trying to shape events.Anonymous has received nowhere near the press coverage for its Middle East activities as it has for its web attacks. To some, though, the former were a high-water mark, showing that the large and haphazard collective could unite to do good.“They have done some spectacularly stupid things, but they should be commended for what they did during the Arab Spring,” says a technology activist from Canada, who uses the name Oxblood Ruffin. Now 60, Ruffin has worked on monitoring-circumvention tools for people in repressive countries since 1996, and his group is sometimes credited with coining the term “hacktivism”. “There were a lot of Anons involved in keeping servers running [during the Arab Spring], in telling people how to use the net and mobile phones safely. That’s 10,000 per cent hacktivism.”But like the topics on the message boards where Anonymous originated, an infinite number of “operations” can be presented in the quest for sufficient support. The next natural winner on the chat channels was WikiLeaks. Interest surged as it began to expose government secrets, and even more so when MasterCard, PayPal and other companies refused to process donations.Anonymous could have taken any number of avenues to express itself, but the main one favoured by members was denial-of-service attacks that overwhelmed financial websites and temporarily knocked them offline.With help from the press, Anonymous’s attacks on behalf of WikiLeaks brought it to its widest ever audience, attracting thousands of people like Martijn Gonlag: college students, slackers and office workers who were rooting for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, himself a hacker of some repute 15 years previously.It was both easier and more effective than traditional forms of protest. Sign into a chat channel, download the software and afflict the comfortably off while spreading the word. “Going on the street with a flag is not going to get you any media attention. It won’t help any more in a digital world,” Gonlag reasoned. “We need to do other things.”…At a psychological level, firing away at corporate or government websites echoes a shift in media habits that is rewiring people who grew up with the internet, the so-called digital natives. Global revenue from gaming has overtaken movies as active participation replaces passive consumption of video.Like many other hacktivists, Gonlag was an avid player of “first-person shooter” games, the protagonist in his own adventures. Digitally attacking MasterCard and Visa elevated that engagement to the real world, a literal dream come true.As Anonymous grew during the WikiLeaks period, it expanded its pioneering use of social networks and other technology. Leaders of various operations coordinated via chat channels and Facebook groups, reaching out to the masses through YouTube and multiple Twitter accounts.The electronic equivalent of a paper trail, though, also attracted security researchers. This posed a potential threat to the biggest players within Anonymous – those whose computers ran the group’s chats or controlled the botnets, or networks of compromised machines, that were being used in some of the assaults and that could also be used for sending spam or stealing data.Law enforcement has a dismal record on cybercrime, arresting fewer than 1 per cent of the perpetrators, according to technology research firm Gartner. The limited expertise typically can’t overcome the difficulty in proving who was at which keyboard at what time and the logistical challenge of chasing cases across national borders.Most of the best cyber crime sleuths work for private security companies, where they can make a name for themselves by exposing new problems or major hackers. In February of this year, I wrote an article in the FT citing chief executive Aaron Barr of security concern HBGary Federal. He told me he had uncovered the true names of many Anonymous leaders and planned to explain his techniques at an imminent security conference.The article set off a panic. A small group of Anonymous leaders and their associates set out to determine what Barr knew – by any means necessary. Taking charge was “Sabu”, a hacker whose first political acts online had come a decade earlier, when he disrupted communications during US Navy bombing exercises in Puerto Rico. He was joined by “Kayla”, “Tflow” and “Topiary”, later the spokesperson for LulzSec.It took them less than a weekend to gain access to HBGary Federal’s e-mails. When the hacktivists subsequently discovered that many of Barr’s identifications were off-base, they published them, devastating the security company and forcing Barr’s resignation on February 28.If the Arab Spring had been the zenith for Anonymous in politics, the HBGary hack marked a peak in industry impact. Sabu, Topiary and some of the others didn’t stop there. They formed LulzSec and went on a 50-day rampage, largely against western law enforcement agencies and security companies. With fewer people, they could move faster than Anonymous and communicate more effectively, soon amassing more than 300,000 followers on Twitter.LulzSec briefly took down the public sites of the CIA and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. Such stunts ensured more media coverage and redoubled a police effort, eventually forcing LulzSec to merge back into the safety of Anonymous.In a break from Anonymous tradition, LulzSec also published what it rooted out from hacked companies, including the phone numbers of police officers and thousands of credit card numbers belonging to Sony customers, among others. Sony said the spate of attacks on its networks, which shuttered the PlayStation online system for more than a month, will cost it in excess of $170m.In theory, the dumps of private data were designed to keep the news reports coming and thereby embarrass companies into improving their defences, as well as to expose any security contractor complicity in internet surveillance or other repression.Indeed some security professionals say that Sony’s massive brand damage and LulzSec’s antics, which included announcing details of the security holes it had crawled through, have prompted executives to take a harder look at their practices. Warnings by officials and experts about the state of technology security had long gone unheeded, in part because costly breaches often aren’t disclosed and public embarrassment is rare.Ironically, the criminal hackers within Anonymous and LulzSec therefore might have done more to advance corporate security than any initiative from White House officials or the burgeoning private security industry.“It is a great classroom to illustrate all the concerns that security people have had for decades,” says Jeff Moss, founder of the DefCon hacking convention and a US administration adviser.Chris Wysopal, a co-founder of the security firm Veracode, who in 1998 testified before a Senate committee about internet vulnerabilities, agreed that in some ways LulzSec was fulfilling a mission that at times seems impossible to complete through legitimate channels.“I struggle with trying to figure out a way to raise awareness that there are a lot of systems out there that are insecure,” says Wysopal. “There is a benefit to the community hearing this information. When doctors tell patients they have a given illness, they can take action. What LulzSec is doing is pointing it out in a more sensational way.”…Yet many of the Anonymous members who supported the denial of service attacks didn’t like the antisecurity operations that were generating so much new press. Others choked at the wanton dissemination of financial data and passwords of random citizens.“Anonymous does have a leadership and they don’t give a **** about us,” one member known as SparkyBlaze wrote in a self-published list of parting complaints. “Does Anon have the right to remove the anonymity of innocent people? They are always talking about people’s right to remain anonymous, so why are they removing that right?”Some followers came to believe that the leaders sought only personal aggrandisement or were effectively in cahoots with the organised criminals who may have raided Sony’s credit-card hoard after Anonymous knocked down the door. Even stalwarts such as Housh are unhappy that much of Anonymous’s infrastructure is now housed on computers used by Russian criminals. “It’s not like the Russians wanted us to get HBGary, but I want to know personally why they are doing this,” he says of the chat hosts. “Where is the money coming from?”Gonlag began actively working against Anonymous after the HBGary hack, as did other ex-followers. Private security experts, including Aaron Barr, bent on professional redemption, joined PayPal and other victims in gathering documents pointing to real identities. Gonlag has passed on tips to the FBI. “I don’t like being a snitch, but what they are doing is wrong.”In July, Scotland Yard’s e-Crime unit arrested young British men it accused of being Topiary and Tflow; Kayla’s arrest was claimed in early September. Once irrepressible on Twitter, Sabu, too, has gone quiet. Suspicions about who is ratting out whom abound, hindering collaboration on new projects.The annual DefCon hacking convention in Las Vegas this August drew many current and former members and sympathisers of Anonymous. The latter included a surprising number whose day jobs involve warding off such threats but who welcome the increased scrutiny Anonymous has brought to cyber-defence.Opinion was divided. At one panel, professional analysts suggested ways the mob might improve on itself, such as by setting criteria for responsible behaviour for security firms that wish to avoid being attacked. At another meeting, former Anonymous member Jennifer Emick railed against what the organisation had become and fended off hecklers, including one in a Guy Fawkes mask.Speaking to me outside the convention, Barr agreed that Anonymous has brought internet activism to a level that will be maintained or exceeded regardless of whether the group itself survives.Less clear is whether the anarchic hacking carried out against security companies like his own former employer will continue. Although he says it may depend on who is arrested and convicted, Barr guesses that it will go on regardless. “I think it’s reached a critical mass.”Joseph Menn is an FT technology correspondent in San Francisco……………………………………………………………..Technology specialBillion dollar brainsSailing away with the NobelBirth of the global mind"
301;V;Visa Inc;2011-09-19T23:15:25Z;Google launches Wallet service;;Google has launched its Wallet service for making one-tap payments with a mobile phone and announced plans to include Visa, American Express and Discover credit cards in addition to its current partner, MasterCard.Using Nexus S 4G phones on Sprint’s network in the US, Google has moved ahead of a similar joint venture called Isis, set up by the AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon mobile operators.Isis is expected to start limited trials next summer, but Google Wallet went live on Monday with Nexus S owners receiving updates on their phones that enabled mobile payments.The Wallet is an app that links to a near-field communication (NFC) chip inside the phone. The technology allows the handset to make a payment by simply tapping on a reader in a shop.“This is just a beginning for us, it’s version 1.0, but we expect the product to move quickly and add new features over the coming months, as well as us increasing the number of banks and handset providers that we partner with,” Osama Bedier, Google vice-president of payments, told the Financial Times.Mr Bedier said Google hoped to make the service available to European consumers in 2012.Initial users will have to have a Citi MasterCard or a Google prepaid card to fund their payments through the Wallet. Their phones will work on MasterCard PayPass tap-to-pay terminals – of which there are more than 120,000 in the US and over 300,000 globally.Visa said in a statement on Monday it had given Google a worldwide licence to use its Visa payWave technology, which is similar to PayPass and is accepted at hundreds of thousands of retail locations worldwide.Google is also working with major retail partners including Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s and Subway to install next-generation tills that work with NFC chips.For retailers, the attraction is not just to ease the payment process for customers, but also to increase engagement with them – tapping on the readers can also add loyalty points or allow digital coupons to be spent.Google Offers is being launched in conjunction with Google Wallet to allow it to be loaded with coupons from retailers.While only one phone model will now work with the service, Google estimates 50 per cent of US smartphones – about 150m devices – will contain NFC chips by 2014.Google may be first in NFC mobile payments, but it is far from the only company that may offer payment services. Apart from the Isis joint venture, PayPal has its own mobile app and Apple is rumoured to be including an NFC chip in the iPhone 5 expected next month.
302;V;Visa Inc;2011-09-13T22:28:19Z;US readies to extend visa waiver system;;The US has laid the ground for citizens of countries such as Brazil and Poland to travel to America without a visa in a move that could provide a lift to a tourism industry that sagged after the September 11 2001 attacks.The possible extension of the so-called visa waiver system follows an extensive review by the Department of Homeland Security of the status of 1.6m foreigners who had overstayed their visas to the US.Visa waivers are now enjoyed by citizens of 23 European countries and other nations such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, allowing them to travel to US after registering online beforehand.Other countries, especially Brazil and Poland, as well as Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus, have lobbied to be granted the same status but have been stymied by debate over how to screen visitors to the country after 9/11.The official panel set up after the 9/11 attacks recommended that visitors to the US be fingerprinted on both the way in and out of the country, as a foolproof method of tracking people who overstay their visas.“Congress has insisted that no other country be given visa waivers unless proper systems for calculating overstays were in place,” said Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations.However, the Department of Homeland Security indicated in testimony to the House of Representatives subcommittee on border and maritime security on Tuesday that it had developed reliable ways to track overstayers without fingerprinting people on their way out of the country.Visitors arriving in the US are fingerprinted on the way in but airlines and airports have strongly opposed repeating the practice on their departure, on the grounds that it is impractical and costly.John Cohen, the deputy co-ordinator for counterterrorism at the DHS, said the department was in a position to “provide to Congress country-by-country data on the percentage of nationals who have overstayed their period of admission”.The administration will now have to persuade a Congress still nervous about border security that the DHS’s new system can work before a decision can be made about visa waivers.Mr Cohen said in his testimony that the department had examined the biographical details passed to the government by airlines of about 1.6m possible overstayers.After searching numerous databanks, only a handful of these people were found to be in the country and pose any national security or public safety risk, officials said.Separately, Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, said rules to screen children under 13 at airports would be eased, to minimise patdowns and the need to remove shoes.
303;V;Visa Inc;2011-09-03T14:02:05Z;Olympic sponsors seek podium for brands;;"Nature Valley, a cereal bar brand owned by General Mills, joined the likes of Coca-Cola and Samsung as an Olympic sponsor this week, paying an undisclosed sum to ensure that athletes, volunteers and spectators consume its snacks when the London 2012 games are under way.For Paul Deighton, chief executive of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Locog), the deal is another small step on the route to his target of raising £700m from domestic sponsorship. He says that the draw of the Olympics is simple: “It’s the ultimate feel-good association”.The question for Nature Valley, and the other Olympic sponsors, is how to turn this “feel-good association” into more concrete measures of revenue and profit. The investment required is a significant one – tier one domestic sponsors of London 2012 pay £50m on average, and worldwide Olympic partners about $100m (£61m)Olympic organisers are quick to point out that not all sponsors pay cash. Some agreements represent value-in-kind services and many are a combination of the two.Mr Deighton highlights three key attractions for companies: it differentiates them from their competitors; provides a global stage to demonstrate their capabilities; and provides a recruitment and motivational tool for employees.Both domestic and global sponsors are guaranteed exclusivity in their business category, and have the right to use the Olympic rings and the London 2012 logo in their marketing campaigns.For companies which supply services to other businesses, which account for about half of the 54 Olympic and Paralympic sponsors, the Olympics is “the perfect stage where they can demonstrate their own capability,” said Mr Deighton.Atos Origin, the France-based IT services provider became a worldwide Olympic partner in 1999 and is co-ordinating the technology behind the London games.Patrick Adiba, its head of major events, said the Olympics enables the company to illustrate the breadth of its expertise. “We showcase to our clients what we do to prepare for the games, how we manage the technology and information systems,” he said.He added that partnering with the Olympics also helps Atos to attract young talent and retain employees: “Our people are proud to be involved in the Olympics and, beyond that, it’s a fantastic accelerator of sales.”But sponsorship is not for everyone. Tim Crow, chief executive of sports marketing consultancy Synergy, said that of 30 companies that approached Synergy about becoming a 2012 sponsor, they advised 27 not to pursue it.“The reason for [signing up] is to generate brand and business value so really the skill of it is, having got all of that equity, how do you use it to accelerate your brand and your business,” he said.Sponsors are partly restricted by IOC rules that prohibit advertising in Olympic venues. “The reality with the Olympics is actually you don’t get a lot compared to the equivalent for the World Cup, in terms of media exposure,” said Mr Crow.Ultimately sponsors must find a way to “activate” their deals to generate a return for their business.Lloyds TSB signed up early, becoming the first tier one domestic sponsor in 2007 in a deal estimated at £80m – and insists it has been worthwhile.“Throughout the financial crisis there were still excellent opportunities for companies to win contracts through the games and through our partnership we’ve been able to help those companies,” said Gordon Lott, head of Lloyds’ 2012 partnership.Lloyds said it was doing business with one in three companies that have a direct contract from the Olympics. “We wouldn’t have been able to do that if we weren’t a partner. That has been an important revenue line for us,” said Mr Lott.Companies have become savvier in their approach to sponsoring the games since the IOC launched the Olympic Partner (TOP) programme in 1985. Eleven companies are signed up to TOP, which allows them to use the Olympics logo and gives them preferential access to broadcast advertising slots in exchange for a minimum four-year commitment.Timo Lumme, the IOC’s director of television and marketing, said: “I would never say it’s easy to get a company to part with over $100m … companies now are much more sophisticated in terms of knowing what they want. They have a better sense of overall marketing objectives and why they want to spend the money,” he said.Olympic sponsorship agreements are not signed “on a chairman’s whim anymore,” he said.Visa, which is one of the founding members of the TOP programme, said it is “constantly learning” how to maximise its sponsorship.Colin Grannell, Visa’s head of partnership marketing, said that one of his goals was to make the company stand out in the sea of Olympic sponsors. “We’re all fighting for a share of awareness,” he admitted.Its not just the sponsors that are fighting for awareness. Other companies will be trying to benefit from the games without paying the sponsorship fees.The most notorious recent example of such “ambush marketing” saw 36 women clad in orange minidresses attend last year’s World Cup match between Holland and Denmark, to promote Bavaria, a Dutch brewer, in spite of Budweiser’s sponsorship.A study by Nielsen, the audience measurement firm, in the run-up to the football tournament last year found that campaigns by non-sponsors such as Carlsberg and Nike drowned out the marketing from official World Cup partners, in part simply by making better ads that created more buzz online.Nevertheless, demand for Olympic sponsorship remains strong. Revenue from the International Olympic Committee’s worldwide sponsorship programme is close to breaching $1bn for the first time.Mr Lumme isn’t surprised by the demand: “It demonstrates there’s a business imperative,” he said.Unlike the World Cup, he said, “you’re buying an overall association to a brand that has a set of ideals.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw"
304;V;Visa Inc;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
305;V;Visa Inc;2011-08-03T14:46:08Z;MasterCard shares surge as profits jump;;MasterCard profits rose 32.8 per cent in the second quarter as consumers spent more on its debit and credit cards.The company’s shares surged more than 7 per cent to $23.55 in morning trading.The world’s second-largest payment processor said net income increased to $608m, or $4.76 a share, from $458m, or $3.49 a share in the same period last year, ahead of market expectations of $4.23 a share. Revenue was up 22 per cent to $1.67bn from $1.37bn on higher spending around the world.“Solid global performance, including strong increases in volume and processed transactions, fuelled double-digit revenue growth this quarter,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive, in a statement.Worldwide, debit and credit spending rose 16 per cent to $608bn, and usage of cards outside of customers’ home countries increased 19 per cent. In the US, debit card purchases surged 19 per cent to $98bn, while credit and charge card payment volumes were up 6 per cent at $129bn.MasterCard has made a push to expand internationally at a time when US consumers are facing lacklustre job growth and a stalling economy. The company said it was benefiting from new business in Brazil and the Netherlands, as well as new relationships with SunTrust and Sovereign, two regional US banks that had previously partnered with rival Visa.Operating expenses rose 21 per cent to $782m from $648m a year ago, driven mainly by acquisition costs. MasterCard bought UK-based DataCash last summer in a bid to be more competitive in online payments and acquired Travelex’s pre-paid card business in December.The company, along with Visa, is also facing new US regulations limiting debit swipe fees and preventing banks from setting exclusive deals with payment networks. While the 21 cents cap per transaction set by the Federal Reserve was higher than the 12 cents proposed by regulators, the rules may limit processors’ revenue, increasing the importance of the industry’s shift towards electronic and mobile payments.MasterCard said it had expanded its presence in mobile commerce through agreements with Google and Isis in the US, Orange and Barclaycard in the UK, China Union Pay in Asia and Swedbank in Nordic and Baltic countries.MasterCard’s results followed Visa’s report last week that its quarterly profits surged 40 per cent to $1bn.
306;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-29T16:14:11Z;My Portfolio: Performance updates;Takeovers, US shares and cash have all affected our columnists’ performance;"John LeePerformance year-to-date: 8.9%Against a backdrop of very unsettled markets, I am well pleased with my 8.9 per cent capital appreciation (excluding dividends) in the year to date. It’s a useful advance on my 3.5 per cent capital gain at end-April. Corporate activity has been particularly beneficial, with two confirmed takeovers: Greene King for Capital Pub and Smiths News for Dawson Holdings. Niche insurance broker THB – which I had only recently built a stake in– is also bid talks with a potential large American suitor. A number of other holdings have performed well since April, mainly on the back of results and trading statements: Ensor, Fenner, MS International, Nichols, Northbridge Industrial, Park Group, and PZ Cussons. On the debit side, thankfully no disasters – just disappointing drifting from the two Cable & Wireless companies and more recently Smiths News (more to come in my August 6 article). Suffice it to say that I have taken advantage of the price weakness in the latter to buy more.Dina IordanovaPerformance year-to-date: 5.1%Good gains from US and Canadian holdings were pulled down by UK sluggishness and/or volatility.My individual savings account (Isa) holdings performed below expectations. I earned well on Ithaca Energy but lost on Barclays.In recent months, planning and trading has been difficult due to problems with the service from my broker TD Waterhouse. I am now moving providers and, once this is completed, I hope to do better. However, the difficulties with the British-based TD Waterhouse brokerage were in part compensated for by good performance – both in terms of growth and dividends – from my TD shares, which I hold in my Canadian portfolio.My US portfolio has grown by an overall 25 per cent, through gains for Netflix, Amazon.com, Apollo, Visa, and TiVo. My only fundholding, however – the Fortune-praised Fairholme – has not lived up to expectations.Due to a focused but risky approach, my self-invested personal pension (Sipp) has grown well, driven by stakes in Smith & Nephew and Pan African Resources.Kevin Goldstein-JacksonPerformance year-to-date: -2.8%My Sipp has continued its disappointing start to the year – it is now down by 2.8 per cent.Poor performers included: Lonmin, down from £19.66 at the start of the year to £13.22; Immupharma, down from 87p to 74.25p; and Falkland Islands Holdings, down from 331p to 310p. However, over the years, I have reduced my holdings in all three companies and taken sufficient profits to more than cover their entire purchase cost. Performance from my City of London Group holding was also disappointing (91p to 78.5p).Another drag on the portfolio was its high level of cash: it accounts for more 35 per cent and interest rates remain very poor.My best performers included two firms in the pharmaceuticals sector: BTG, whose shares were up from 231.4p to 293.7p; and Oxford BioMedica, up 5.53p to 7.05p. Both have issued a number of encouraging statements regarding their medical treatments. Industrial engineer Weir has delivered outstanding performance: its shares are up from £17.80 to £22.10p.Nick LouthPerformance year-to-date: 6.0 per centIn less than a month, the year-to-date performance of my portfolio has jumped by 4.5 percentage points to 6 per cent – helped by a strong rise in Apple shares that I had repeatedly argued was overdue. I have rarely been more sure of a value proposition than this one and, last year, devoted the entire US portion of my portfolio to it.

307;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;How rich is Yao Ming?;;"The basketball world bid farewell to one of its brightest (and tallest) stars last week, as Chinese superstar Yao Ming announced his retirement from the game following a persistent foot injury.To mark the occasion, Wealth-X – the private wealth intelligence outfit – decided to find out just how much the ‘Little Giant’ is now worth.The headline figure is impressive. The 30-year-old Shanghai native is worth an estimated $103m – earned, mainly, through wages from the Houston Rockets, along with $25m in endorsement earnings from McDonald’s, Reebok, Apple, Gatorade and Visa. (Those companies are bound to have more than recouped their investments – with China’s market for fast food, sportswear and all things Apple growing apace.)With that cash he’s made some interesting investments.For one, he is reportedly the majority shareholder in Beijing UniStrong Science & Technology – a Shenzhen-listed GPS tech company. His 75 per cent stake is worth around $3.5m.That investment has been something of rollercoaster ride. It tripled in value during the week after it listed, only to fall all the way back down again days later. Its current share price represents a 5 per cent gain since the listing.He also owns shares worth $500,000 in Orca Digital, which in turn owns Top100.cn – China’s biggest legal music download website.His other investments are much more ‘Yao Ming’. He owns a Chinese restaurant in Houston (which doubles as a sport bar and was voted Houston’s best Chinese eaterie this year), which is a neat intro to our favourite line of Wealth-X’s dossier on the NBA’s tallest player in the 2010-2011 season.Yao’s favorite food is pizza. He also likes meat, especially steak, and Chinese soup made by his mother. He drinks nutrient drinks every day after training and avoids ice cream and fried foods. Also appears to enjoy Starbucks coffee.His biggest holding is actually the Shanghai Oriental Basketball club. He also set up a charity following the Sichuan earthquake.So where does he keep the rest of it? Under his enormous mattress? (He is 7 feet 6 inches tall, and has a customised BMW to fit his frame.)Perhaps. Yao Ming’s fortune is certainly heavy in ‘liquid assets’ – cash, bonds and equity investments most likely. So he’ll probably be watching the political deadlock in Washington with his own sense of worry.Related reading:

308;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-27T23:21:34Z;Visa benefits from payments boom;Consumer trend for electronic transactions continues;Visa, the world’s largest electronic payments company, exceeded Wall Street’s expectations by reporting a 40 per cent surge in quarterly profit as more consumers turned to credit cards and other forms of electronic transaction.Global payments volume increased by 13 per cent in the three months ending in March, and remained at that pace during Visa’s fiscal third quarter. Optimism for the world’s continued migration toward electronic payments has helped the San Francisco-based company offset concerns that new US regulations limiting transaction fees would sap revenue.“The most powerful driver of volume is this awesome growth story of the electronification of payments and the rising affluence of emerging markets – the shift from cash and checks to plastic,” said Tucker Brown, research principal at Sustainable Growth Advisers, which oversees $1.8bn.Fiscal third-quarter net income jumped to $1bn, or $1.43 per class A share, from $716m, or 97 cents, a year earlier. Excluding the effects of revaluing the company’s put option on Visa Europe, it would have earned $1.26 a share. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast that Visa would earn $1.23 a share.“Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial and operational performance as we benefited from growth in global payments volume and solid cross-border and processed transaction growth,” Joseph Saunders, Visa’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Total revenue at Visa rose 14 per cent to $2.32bn. Service revenue, or what Visa collects on transactions that stream through its network, jumped 21 per cent to $1.1bn. Data-processing revenue climbed 12 per cent to $886m. Revenue from international transactions rose 15 per cent to $662m. Operating expenses increased by 10 per cent to $977m.Visa’s shares, which slipped 1.63 per cent on Wednesday ahead of the results, inched higher in late trading after the company announced its quarterly results. The stock has risen by 25 per cent so far this year. The company’s board has also authorised a $1bn share buy-back plan.The stock had soared 15 per cent on June 30 after the US Federal Reserve set a higher-than-expected cap on debit-card transaction fees. The new limit on so-called interchange fees, which had been mandated by last year’s Dodd-Frank financial services reform legislation, will take effect in October.Visa reiterated its forecasts, noting that it expects to lift earnings per share by more than 20 per cent this year and “in the mid to high teens range” in fiscal 2012. The company expects net revenue to climb 11-15 per cent in fiscal 2011 and by high single to low double digits the following year.“As we address the new regulatory landscape, we are prepared to deliver on our financial goals and remain an industry-leading growth company,” Mr Saunders said.Visa was run as association of banks whose credit-card divisions relied on its electronic network and marketing heft until 2008, when the company sold stock in what was then the largest initial public offering in US history.Visa also said it had secured a multi-year agreement to extend its partnership with United Continental Holdings. The US airline, along with JPMorgan Chase, co-market a Visa credit card that awards frequent-flier miles. Terms were not disclosed.
309;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-27T22:51:14Z;A big hacking arrest and a PayPal boycott;;As UK police said they arrested the alleged second of four co-founders of the hacking supergroup Lulz Security, one of those still at large branched out into a legal form of protest, promoting a boycott of PayPal.Scotland Yard said it arrested the suspected Lulz Security spokesman, a 19-year-old known online as Topiary, at a residence in the Shetland Islands on Tuesday. That came a week after a 16-year-old believed to be Tflow was picked up in South London.The tender ages of the suspects surprised some private security experts who have been involved in the international hunt for the group, which had gone on an unprecedented public hacking spree that touched everyone from the CIA to Sony to News Corp. to Sony again and Sony some more.Lulz officially disbanded a month ago and called on its followers to rejoin Anonymous, the broader collective made famous for its brute force denial-of-service attacks on the websites of MasterCard, Visa and PayPal after those firms stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks last year.Last week, the US made its first 16 arrests in the Anonymous and Lulz probe, and 14 of the suspects were picked up for the attacks on PayPal, which is owned by Ebay.Court filings emerged this week showing that PayPal went to some trouble to help the FBI build those cases, and the former Lulz leader known as Sabu urged people on Tuesday to show their disapproval by closing their PayPal accounts.Anonymous members claimed tens of thousands of such cancellations, but a PayPal spokesman said the volume was within normal bounds.Sabu didn’t pledge to give up on more dramatic gestures, such as electronic breaking and entering. But with more reason to fear that spree may come to an end in the near term, he may be trying to package a legacy with more claims to legitimacy.As Topiary put it in his final Tweet: “You cannot arrest an idea.”
310;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-27T20:54:23Z;Wall Street lower amid default fears;;US stocks fell on Wednesday, accelerating losses sustained this week as investors grew increasingly apprehensive about the absence of a deal from Washington over raising the debt ceiling and averting a US default.Global markets were in a “risk-off” mode, given the impasse in Washington, with Wall Street unable to gain impetus from good earnings results, led by Boeing and Dow Chemical.A proposal by the Republican party to raise the debt ceiling has been delayed until Thursday, as the plan faces a possible conservative mutiny.“It now seems clear that the market has the whole DC debt limit debate exactly wrong,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. “It’s not that the market will rally after Congress and the president reach an agreement. It’s that there won’t be an agreement until the stock market tanks.”The S&P 500 dropped 2 per cent to 1,304.89.Of the 10 main S&P industry groups, technology was the biggest loser with a drop of 2.95 per cent, followed by industrials, down 2.7 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.7 per cent to 2,764.79 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 per cent at 12,302.55.In a sign that nervousness and uncertainty was growing, the Vix, an indicator of future volatility, rose 13 per cent and touched its highest level since March.However, Dunkin’ Brands, which listed on Nasdaq, jumped 47 per cent to $28.85 in its first of trading day. The company has raised $422.75m after pricing its initial public offering at $19 a share, higher than the range of $16 to $18 set by underwriters.Corning said its second-quarter profits dropped 17 per cent, as the speciality glass maker was hit by a higher tax rate, while its supply of liquid crystal display glass was disrupted by Japan’s earthquake and tsunami in March. Its shares fell 7.2 per cent to $16.04.Shares in Juniper Networks, a network equipment maker, plunged 21 per cent to $24.66 after the company reported disappointing results for the second quarter. Juniper also warned that the “outlook for the September quarter reflects some near-term market weakness”.But shares in Amazon were up 3.9 per cent at $222.52, after the online retailer reported higher revenues but lower profits late on Tuesday. The company still beat estimates.Boeing reported a 20 per cent rise in second-quarter profits and upgraded its outlook for 2011, lifting its earnings per share guidance to between $3.90 and $4.10.Shares in the aircraft maker rose 0.7 per cent to $70.63, after its net income rose to $941m, compared with $787m in the second quarter of 2010.Dow Chemical reported a 74 per cent rise in profits to 84 cents a share on sales of $16bn, which beat analysts’ estimates, and the company also announced the sale of its polypropylene unit. Its shares lost 2.4 per cent to $34.99.Ford, a day after reporting a 7.7 per cent drop in earnings from a year ago, was planning to sell a benchmark 10-year debt issue. The stock was down 4.4 per cent at $12.37.Shares in WellPoint dropped 6.6 per cent to $68.70, after the company reported better-than-expected results and warned of rising costs for its Medicare plans for seniors.The US debt debate “is weighing on markets but so is the weaker-than-expected durable goods report”, said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “We may be faced with a US downgrade but what we will definitely be faced with is weak economic growth.”Data on US second-quarter gross domestic product growth will be released on Friday.Durable goods orders for June fell 2.1 per cent, weaker than the expected rise of 0.3 per cent. Orders excluding transportation rose 0.1 per cent, and were also below estimates.“Manufacturing has lost momentum in recent months and it is hard to place all the blame on knock-on effects from Japanese supply chain disruptions,” said analysts at RDQ Economics.They added: “Motor vehicles have played a very significant part in the drop in durable goods orders over the past three months, as total durable goods orders have fallen at an annualised rate of 10.4 per cent since March, while orders of motor vehicles and parts have fallen at a more rapid pace of 23 per cent.”
311;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-21T01:06:16Z;Ebay results exceed expectations;;Ebay, the e-commerce group, beat analysts’ expectations with revenue growth of 25 per cent despite profits falling 31 per cent because of a large acquisition in the second quarter.The company also reported two milestones in its payment business PayPal, which exceeded 100m active users during the quarter and had its first quarter where revenues exceeded $1bn.Ebay expects PayPal’s total payment volume on mobile phones to exceed $3bn this year, compared with $750m in 2010. This quarter, it reported $1.1bn in revenues, a 31 per cent increase compared with the same quarter last year.Margins in the core business were down mainly due to the completion of its $2.4bn acquisition of GSI Commerce.John Donahoe, chief executive, said Ebay was uniquely positioned to compete in an evolving retail ecosystem where online and offline commerce are increasingly overlapping, with mobile sales and payments playing a big role in that transition. “Simply put, we’re playing offense,” he said. “While others talk about the promise of mobile payments, PayPal is delivering.”Without offering details, Mr Donahoe promised a mobile payment pilot with a major retailer before the end of the year, with multiple large merchants to join in 2012.Several large companies, including Visa and Google, have announced plans in recent months for a “mobile wallet”, where consumers will be able to pay for things with credit card data stored in their phones.Ebay reported pro forma earnings of 48 cents per share on $2.76bn in net revenue, an increase of 25 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. These results exceeded analysts’ estimates of 46 cents per share on $2.61bn in revenue.Net income, however, fell to $283m, or 22 cents a share, from $412m, or 31 cents a share, compared with the same quarter last year.Mr Donahoe told investors to expect an increase in marketing costs in the third and fourth quarters as Ebay works to increase its profile in the US and Europe. “You will see us on TV in Q3 and Q4,” he said.The core business, where people can sell or auction items directly to other users on the site, grew 17 per cent to $14.7bn in gross merchandise volume. The company expects to double mobile merchandise sales in 2011 to $4bn.Ebay shares fell 2 per cent in after hours trading.

313;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Assange warns of phone hacking’s “collateral damage”;;Julian Assange appeared at a press conference in London today to talk about WikiLeaks’ legal challenge to Visa and Mastercard, which have been blocking payments to the whistleblowing service for months in what its founder describes as an “economic blockade”.He contrasted the payment firms’ stance on WikiLeaks – which he claims comes after political pressure from the US – with the phone hacking case at Rupert Murdoch’s UK newspapers.“WikiLeaks and its employees have not been charged with any illegal activity,” he said. “Compare that to News International who has had employees and contractors imprisoned for illegal activity and yet still we do not see US financial companies cutting off their services to News International. Why not?”There has been no suggestion that the crisis surrounding Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire might spread from advertisers – whose abandonment of the News of the World contributed to its closure last week – to payment firms.But Mr Assange did indicate that he regretted the shuttering of Murdoch’s most popular Sunday newspaper.“It does appear, based on the allegations, that in some cases News International overstepped the boundaries of what was ethical. That does not mean that an entire newspaper should receive the death sentence,” he said.He added that a few employees or executives – mentioning no names – should be “dealt with” but not a whole staff of journalists.“It’s always a loss to a community when it loses one of its newspapers,” Mr Assange continued. “So I’d ask people to think carefully about the difference between destroying an institution and a few bad apples.”This is an ethically tricky area for Mr Assange. It has been claimed that some of WikiLeaks’ sensational exposés of classified military and diplomatic documents in recent years could have been the fruit of computer hacking. Mr Assange appeared to suggest that the nature of the target justified the means – ruling a murdered schoolgirl’s mobile phone out, but governments in.“Journalists act bravely when they hold organisations more powerful than themselves to account,” he said. “Journalists are opportunists when they and their powerful organisations predates [prey on] on the privacy of individuals that are less powerful than them.”He claimed that he had not been “following closely” the phone hacking case which has dominated the UK media in the last 10 days. But he did add a warning to the current push to change how the British press is regulated:“In our fervour to deal with the unethical practices that seem to have occurred in News Corp… we should be careful of producing collateral damage that will destroy the ability of investigative journalists to act in the public good.”As an aside, the interest of journalists in WikiLeaks itself seems to be waning somewhat. Barely 20 people – including photographers and cameramen – turned out to see Mr Assange opposite London’s high court on Thursday, a far cry from his packed-out appearances at the Frontline Club earlier in the year.
314;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-14T18:00:08Z;Brussels urged to act on WikiLeaks cash curb;;Visa Europe and MasterCard are facing a competition complaint in Brussels over their decision to block credit card payments to WikiLeaks, the whistleblowing website.Julian Assange, WikiLeaks’ founder, said the payment processors’ “economic blockade” had cost the website tens of millions of euros and that the site could become financially unviable if the action did not end.DataCell, the Icelandic internet hosting and data centre company that handled payments for WikiLeaks, filed a complaint to the European Commission on Thursday, saying the payment processing companies had acted unlawfully in stopping payments to the site.Visa and MasterCard and a number of other financial services companies such as PayPal restricted payments to WikiLeaks in December after the website angered governments by publishing thousands of secret US diplomatic cables. The payments companies were later targeted by activist computer hackers in revenge.The block on payments has made it difficult for supporters of WikiLeaks to make donations to the site. DataCell was handling about €130,000 ($186,000) worth of donations a day to WikiLeaks before its payment processing services were stopped. WikiLeaks relies on a large number of small public donations to continue its work.“We have lost around 90 per cent of our donations in value terms and the estimated loss based on those rough figures we have so far is some €15m,” Mr Assange said.He added that WikiLeaks’ work had been “tremendously impeded” by lack of funds, but that it continued to release thousands of cables from its cache of US diplomatic memos.Mr Assange compared WikiLeaks’ position with that of News International, which has faced many allegations of phone hacking and other illegal activity at its UK newspapers in recent weeks.“WikiLeaks and its employees have not been charged with any illegal activity,” he told reporters in London. “Compare that to News International who has had staff, employees and contractors imprisoned for illegal activity yet still we do not see US financial companies cutting off their services to News International. Why not?”Mr Assange is fighting a UK High Court battle against a decision to extradite him to Sweden to face charges of “non-consensual, coerced sex”.DataCell said Visa and MasterCard’s block on payments was unjustified and an abuse of their dominant position in the market. The data centre company maintains it has violated neither Icelandic law nor Visa and MasterCard’s terms of service in serving WikiLeaks as a customer.Visa Europe has a 67.7 per cent share of the payment card market in Europe, while MasterCard has 27.7 per cent.DataCell’s lawyer, Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, said the block on payments had left the company unable to carry on with its normal data centre business, as it could not take card payments from any of its customers. He said the company had suffered business losses of about €50m as a result.The Commission confirmed it had received the complaint and was reviewing it. Officials declined to comment further.EU competition officials do, however, know both card companies well after a decade-long tussle over their fees charged on cross-border card payments. Although these cases have been resolved to some extent, Visa is still in dispute with the commission over fees on credit card payments while MasterCard last week faced off against Brussels in the European courts over principles involved in determining fees on credit and debit cards generally.Visa Europe has a 67.7 per cent share of the payment card market in Europe, while MasterCard has 27.7 per cent. The companies told the Financial Times that it was usual practice to suspend payments to companies suspected of illegal behaviour.Visa said on Thursday that it was “happy to discuss [the complaint] with the Commission”. MasterCard declined to comment on the complaint.Additional reporting by Nikki Tait in Brussels.
315;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-13T15:59:11Z;Monitise’s revenues from mobile payments soar;;Monitise, the mobile payments technology company, has more than doubled full-year revenues to £14m in the past year, indicating growing interest by consumers in using the mobile handset to pay for items.London-listed Monitise said it had nearly 4.5m registered customers, double the number seen a year ago. About 3.5m of those customers are in the UK, indicating that roughly 10 per cent of UK bank account holders are using Monitise in some way.Monitise said it was handling mobile payments of about £100m a month for customers, which implies more than £20 per month per user. Mobile payments have often been for relatively low-value items of £2-£3, but Monitise’s figures show customers are becoming comfortable with larger sums passing through their handsets.Shares in Monitise rose more than 7 per cent on Wednesday to 37p.Mobile payment transactions could reach up to €82bn in value in western Europe in the next three years, according to Frost and Sullivan, the technology analysts.Interest has increased in mobile payments over recent months. In May Google unveiled a “Google Wallet” application together with MasterCard, Citibank, and Sprint Nextel. Research in Motion said earlier this year it was integrating mobile payments into its BlackBerry devices and Apple is widely expected to be planning its own mobile payments solution for the iPhone.PayPal and Moneybookers, the online payments providers, are also increasingly moving to provide payments on smartphones. PayPal recently bought mobile payments company Zong for $240m to increase its reach in this area.“The market has really taken off in the last four to six months,”said Bob Liao, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “We are seeing more and more announcements from operators. But it is clear that Monitise is well positioned, with exposure to the major banks and Visa.”Monitise, founded in 2002, is emerging as a key technology provider to many mobile money schemes. It has developed an iPad banking application for Royal Bank of Scotland, and is part of the Mobile Money Network, a platform for mobile payments set up by the UK’s Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy, the US retailer. It also signed a $50m deal with Visa to supply mobile banking software, and has a relationship with Fidelity National Information Services, which processes payments for hundreds of US banks.Monitise, which is due to report full-year results in September, is still loss-making, with operating losses expected to be about £16m this year. In spite of the rapid growth in user numbers the company is spending heavily on expanding into regions such as Asia.
316;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
317;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-08T06:37:38Z;High-profile hacking attacks to benefit NCC;;NCC Group would benefit from digital security concerns after a string of high-profile attacks, the ethical hacking specialist said, as it announced strong earnings growth for the year to May.“We’ve got probably the best piece of marketing and advertising you could ever imagine, which is the hacking world moving …into out-and-out war,” said Rob Cotton, chief executive. “The marketplace is the best it’s ever been.”About two-thirds of NCC Group’s revenue came from its assurance division, which tests the security of websites and performs forensic investigations after hacking attacks. The division’s turnover rose 87 per cent to £46.1m ($73.6m), helped by two acquisitions.Companies including Visa and MasterCard, as well as state agencies such as the CIA and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency have suffered cyberattacks in the past year. Sony enlisted NCC Group’s help after hackers stole more than 70m user records, a person close to NCC Group said.Group revenue rose 49 per cent to £71m, with adjusted profit up 21 per cent to £17.3m. But pre-tax profit was down slightly at £12.8m (£13m).There was slower growth in the high-margin escrow business, which holds source codes for companies in case the provider ceases to support their software. Its revenue rose only 8 per cent to £24.9m.Mr Cotton blamed this on underperformance in the UK escrow operations, in part because of high staff turnover among sales executives, who were not being properly “looked after”. Senior managers in the division had been “underperforming”, and had now been replaced, he added.Analysts were unperturbed by the weaker performance in that division, expecting it to be boosted by the takeover of the US company Escrow Associates, and focusing on the potential for rapid growth in the assurance business.“They have had a number of issues with personnel over the years. But to have consensus-beating results, even though the main profit driver was underperforming, is testament to the depth and breadth of the business,” said Jonathan Imlah at Collins Stewart.The company is hoping for rapid growth in the US assurance market after the acquisition of California-based iSec. “iSec is the biggest player in that market – they work for all the great and the good in Silicon Valley,” Mr Cotton said.Arun George, at Altium, said “the momentum [in the assurance division] has clearly increased”, with NCC boosting revenues by selling higher-value services to existing customers.Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 36.7p, while the final dividend rose to 8.85p (7.25p), lifting the total by 21 per cent to 13p.The shares rose 5p to 650p on Thursday.
318;V;Visa Inc;2011-07-01T20:30:24Z;Wall Street rally gathers pace;Rising optimism over economy;Wall Street saw its sharpest weekly gains in two years after better than expected manufacturing data buoyed risk appetite, helping the major indices achieve their fifth consecutive session of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.4 per cent to 1,339.67, led by the consumer discretionary, financial and industrial sectors, after strong data raised hopes that the US economy was coming out of the recent slow patch.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing, led by Apollo Group, which jumped 6.4 per cent to $46.46 after the operator of for-profit schools reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.Elsewhere in the sector, Darden Restaurants was up 6.1 per cent to $52.78 while Wynn Resorts added 4.2 per cent to $149.57.But the gains were broad based, with all 10 major sectors moving forward after the reading for the ISM manufacturing index came in at 55.3 for June. This was ahead of the 53.5 in May and better than the 52 expected by economists. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.This number followed news on Thursday that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index had come in at 61.1, which was also well above economists’ expectations and raised hopes that the economy was improving after weeks in the doldrums.“This data are a strong sign we are coming out of the recent soft patch,” said Mark Lamkin, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Lamkin Wealth Management.This feeling on Wall Street lifted risky assets. The S&P financial and industrial sectors were up 1.7 per cent while the consumer discretionary sector added 2 per cent and technology stocks were up 1.7 per cent.Defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecoms were some of the worst performing, rising only 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Gains in the industrial sector were led by Cummins which put on 3.8 per cent to $107.42 while the technology sector was dominated by gains from Visa and MasterCard.The credit card companies continued to be lifted by news on Wednesday that the US Federal Reserve set a higher than expected cap on debit card transaction fees. Visa was up 4.4 per cent to $87.97 while MasterCard added 4.4 per cent to $314.47.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average index up 1.4 per cent at 12,581.86 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.5 per cent higher at 2,816.03.The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 5.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, over the week.The S&P 500 added 5.6 per cent over the five days, the best week on the index since July 2009. The Dow and the Nasdaq also saw their best week in two years.The only real downbeat news in the session was that the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence index came in at 71.5 for June, slightly short of the 72 reading expected and down from 74.3 in May, but the markets shrugged this off.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 4.8 per cent to 15.72, adding to the 21.7 per cent drop it had already seen this week as investors positioned themselves for a steady climb in the equity markets.The week on Wall Street kicked off in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the big indices bounced off key technical support levels reached the previous week after nearly two straight months of losses.The S&P 500 had fallen 7 per cent from the start of May, reaching a bottom at the end of last week. The index found its support level just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound that followed over the news five days was sharp, with the S&P index putting on around 1 per cent every session.The markets were helped by a partial resolution to the situation in Greece on Wednesday and then the stronger manufacturing data on Thursday and Friday. Investors were also positioning themselves for the upcoming earnings season – starting in earnest on July 11 – which is expected to be quite strong.In recent quarters markets have generally rallied before and during the earnings season as investors turn their attention away from macroeconomic concerns and on to companies news.This repositioning took form of a rotation into risk assets. The best performing sectors over the week were energy, which was up 7.2 per cent, technology, which added 6.8 per cent and consumer discretionary, which rose 6.6 per cent.One of the biggest pieces of corporate news from the session was the strong earnings results from Nike, which came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter.Shares in Nike were up 13.1 per cent to $91.82.
319;V;Visa Inc;2011-06-30T21:02:08Z;Tech stocks lead gains on Wall Street;;Wall Street concluded the final session of a mostly depressed and volatile quarter on a positive note as upbeat economic data lifted sentiment and investors began to position themselves long in anticipation of a healthy forthcoming earnings season.The technology sector saw some of the strongest gains helped by First Solar, the largest solar power company by market capitalisation, which rose 2.2 per cent to $132.27 after it won $4.5bn in loan guarantees from the US department of energy for three projects it is developing in California.Elsewhere in the sector Hewlett-Packard was up 2.4 per cent to $36.40 while Intel added 3.6 per cent to $22.16. The S&P information technology index rose 1.4 per cent, adding to the 3.5 per cent gains earlier in the week.Ebay, the online marketplace which owns PayPal, rose 4.6 per cent to $32.27, benefiting from a number of ratings upgrades following news on Wednesday that third-party payment systems like PayPal will likely not be subject to new rules limiting credit charge transaction payments.These gains left the S&P 500 up 1 per cent at 1,320.64, adding to the 3.1 per cent gains earlier in the week and helping the index break through its psychologically significant 100-day moving average line.The rally was broad based, with all 10 big S&P sectors moving higher, as sentiment across the board was lifted by news that business conditions in the Chicago area had improved unexpectedly in June.The Chicago purchasing managers index rose to 61.1 this month, which exceeded the 54 reading that had been expected by economists and was up 4.5 points from May. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion. The Chicago PMI is seen as a leading indicator for the national ISM factory index, due on Friday.The strong PMI data lifted the industrial sector in particular. Joy Global led the gains, rising 5.7 per cent to $95.24 while Cummins added 2.4 per cent to $103.49.The S&P industrial sector was up 1.7 per cent – the best performing on Wall Street – adding to the 2.9 per cent gains earlier in the week.The PMI news helped investors shrug off disappointing data from the labour department showing that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits was mostly unchanged last week, falling only 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 428,000.Investors were also unperturbed that Thursday marked the end of the Federal Reserve’s second round of quantitative easing, a $600bn bond-buying programme that has helped buoy the markets since the plan was floated last August.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent at 12,414.34, also helped by energy and material stocks as commodity prices ticked up. The index was up 0.8 per cent over the quarter and up 7.2 per cent over the year to date.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.2 per cent to 2,773.52, but was down 0.3 per cent over the quarter.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 5.4 per cent to 16.34 in the session as investors positioned for a steady climb in the equity markets.“A big part of what is driving the market right now is people positioning themselves for a strong earnings season,” said Rex Macey, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. The earnings season starts in earnest on July 11 when Alcoa reports.Stocks are also benefiting from the belief that the 7.2 per cent losses on the S&P from the May high to the June low has left the markets oversold.“The recent pull-back provides a buying opportunity,” said analysts at Citigroup. “Collectively we forecast double-digit gains for equity markets in second half 2011.”The second quarter on Wall Street started with a month of modest 2.9 per cent gains on the S&P, but then weak economic numbers on employment, manufacturing and gross domestic product left sentiment in the doldrums from the end of April until last week.The S&P 500 saw six straight weeks of losses from the start of May, the longest run of declines since June and July 2008. If not for a 0.04 per cent gain on week seven, the markets would have seen the longest run of weekly losses in a decade.But last Friday the big indices on Wall Street bumped into some technical support levels, convincing traders that the markets were oversold after such a long time in the doldrums. Sentiment has also been helped by some positive news out of Greece and expectations that the upcoming earnings season will be broadly positive.The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent in the quarter, but was still up 5 per cent over the year to date.
320;V;Visa Inc;2011-06-29T20:47:11Z;Financials lead Wall Street higher;;Financial stocks saw some of the strongest gains in an upbeat session on Wall Street as the big indices continued to bounce off some technical lows last week and sentiment was lifted by news that the Greek parliament had passed a package of austerity measures.The financial sector, which has been one of the worst performing in recent months, falling 14 per cent from its last cyclical high in February, bounced up 2.1 per cent led by the large investment banks.Morgan Stanley was up 4.8 per cent to $23.39 while Goldman Sachs rose 2.6 per cent to $132.58. The S&P investment banking index was up 3.1 per cent.The S&P financial sector has now added 3.7 per cent in the past three days, and is on course for its best week in nearly seven months.Elsewhere in the sector, Visa was up 15 per cent to $86.58 while MasterCard added 11.3 per cent to $309.70 on news that the Federal Reserve is proposing to rework limits on fees that banks can charge each time a consumer uses a debit card.Bank of America added 3 per cent to $11.14 as investors reacted positively to news that the bank will pay $8.5bn to finally settle claims by investors that mortgage-backed securities sold by its Countrywide Financial unit failed to meet underwriting requirements and other guidelines.These gains helped the S&P 500 put on 0.8 per cent to 1,307.41, pulling the measure back over the psychologically significant 1,300 mark and reacquainting the benchmark index with its 150-day moving average lost three weeks ago.The materials sector saw the next strongest gains in the session after financials as the sector benefited from the uptick in global risk appetite after the Greek vote and some strong analysts’ reports on the steel industry.US Steel rose 5.9 per cent to $45.85 while AK Steel added 5.2 per cent to $15.51 after the companies received a ratings upgrade from Deutsche Bank. The sector also benefited from a Goldman Sachs note saying that steel demand in the third quarter may surprise to the upside.Elsewhere in the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was up 2.3 per cent to $51.62 while Allegheny Technologies rose 4.3 per cent to $64.29.Monsanto, the largest seed company by revenue, which is also a member of the S&P materials index, was up 5 per cent to $70.26 after reporting a 77 per cent jump in earnings on higher sales of Roundup weed killer and genetically modified crop seeds.The energy sector saw the next strongest gains. The S&P energy index was up 1.1 per cent as Halliburton, the oilfield services company, added 2.3 per cent to $49.82 and Schlumberger rose 1 per cent to $85.22.All these gains left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.6 per cent to 12,262.78, moving to within striking distance of its 100-day moving average line, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,740.49.The 3.1 per cent gains on the S&P 500 index so far this week, following nearly two straight months of losses, have led some investors to argue that the market reached a bottom last week when the index neared its technically significant 200-day moving average line.Sentiment on Wednesday was helped by better-than-expected housing data. Figures showed that pending sales of previously owned US homes rose 8.2 per cent in May ahead of the 3 per cent rise expected.This follows news in the previous session that April saw a rare monthly rise in home prices on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in the beleaguered housing market may be abating somewhat.But most argued that there was still little reason to be bullish on the downtrodden sector, particularly as the gains in pending sales last month followed a 11.3 per cent drop in pending sales in April.“In absolute terms this is a very depressed level, and with prices in most areas either still declining or flat, there is little incentive for buyers to be aggressive,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Shares in KB Home fell 15.4 per cent to $10.08 in the session after the homebuilder reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss, in a further confirmation that the sector was far from healthy.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in BJ’s Wholesale Club were up 4.6 per cent to $50.29 after the discount retailer announced that it was selling itself to the private equity firms Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital Partners for $2.8bn, wrapping up a months-long sale process.
321;V;Visa Inc;2011-06-28T19:28:06Z;Small-caps: Chariot bounces along;;Chariot Oil & Gas bounced back on Tuesday after the exploration company said it had managed to renew its large offshore Namibian licences.Analysts said the announcement was good news for Chariot because the company could now conclude joint venture agreements to develop the potentially lucrative prospects.“We would be hopeful that the removal of this uncertainty will assist the conclusion and signing of a second (after Petrobras in 2009) material farm-out for Chariot in the coming weeks and will also ensure that at least two exploration wells will be drilled over the next 12 months,” said Ambrian Capital.Chariot rose 10.2 per cent to 167½p.888 Holdings added 9.8 per cent to 33½p on talk that the online gaming company could be a takeover target for Playtech, up 0.2 per cent to 329p. Bid rumours were also swirling round Game Group, 15.5 per cent higher at 33½p. The computer games retailer has been touted as a possible target for US rival Gamestop, However, traders reckoned Tuesday’s advance owed more to short sellers closing their positions.Monitise added 6.5 per cent to 28¾p on rumours of predatory interest from Visa and talk of further stake building. On Monday, Goldman Sachs bought 4m shares for a client, which traders believe is building a stake in the payments company via an equity swap.PV Crystalox lost 42.9 per cent to 25¼p after the solar company warned first half shipments would fall short of expectations and it might register a loss in the second half of the year.Max Property, Nick Leslau’s new property vehicle, was in focus after buying London’s historic St Katharine Docks for just over £155m. The shares rose 2.1 per cent to 119p.WSP fell 16.9 per cent to 260p after the engineering consultancy warned on profits, blaming cuts to local authority and Highway Agency spending on extending and maintaining transport infrastructure in the UK. That news also hit heavily indebted rival Mouchel, down 7.8 per cent to 59p.“The tightening in the transportation sector and a further significant public sector decline in the UK anticipated by WSP must be seen for Mouchel in the context of a falling order book and below average win-rate,” said Nick Spoliar of Arbuthnot.“For Mouchel, with no geographical escape hatch, our concerns focus not just on the declines in the business but the inherent weakening of the core of their operations as the inevitable and indeed essential cost-cutting continues,” he added.Separately, Liberum Capital cut its forecast for Mouchel, citing a “sense that current trading at its management consulting unit is difficult”.Noventa shed 7.7 per cent to 39p even though the tantalum supplier announced the appointment of Fernando Fernandez-Torres, a qualified industrial engineer, with over 30 years experience, as its new chief executive. Canaccord Genuity was impressed by the hire.“Fernando has a reputation for turning around difficult mining operations, recently working for EMED Mining specifically focusing on its Rio Tinto Copper Mine in Spain, the broker said. “The market for tantalum remains strong and we do not believe the current share price recognises the value inherent in these assets, even after accounting for the necessary additional capital requirement of $25m.
322;V;Visa Inc;2011-06-09T19:05:30Z;Visa invests in mobile banking;;The headlong rush into mobile banking continued on Thursday with Visa announcing two deals in this area. The payments company has bought Fundamo, a South African mobile software company for $110m. It has also signed a 5-year deal with Monitise, a UK company that helps verify mobile banking transactions.The deals come after last month Google, Mastercard and Citigroup announced plans to launch a “mobile wallet” that could be used at a number of stores in the US.With more than 5bn mobile phone users around the world, it is easy to see why the cellphone looks like such an attractive market for payments companies. In saturated, developed markets it is seen as a way to retain customers who are looking for more and more convenient ways to pay. In the emerging markets, its a way to capture a new market of people who use banks only through their mobile phones.Fundamo makes software that allows people to transfer money from one phone to another. It is best known for creating the Mobile Money services that are used throghout Africa. Fundamo sells software to 70 financial instititions, in Africa, Asia and the Middle East who in turn use it for 5m clients.It could reach 180m more, Visa said.Monitise also makes software that allows money transfers between mobile phones. It processes and verifies mobile payments for most UK banks, and has been expanding into the US. Visa wants to use the system to allow all Visa’s prepaid and debit card customers in the US to pay by mobile.Mobile payments have been talked about for well over a decade, but are only now beginning to see some real uptake by the industry. The most difficult part has always been making sure that different phones and banks can talk to each other and make transactions happen smoothly. No one wants to miss out on a payment because a message was mis-sent. Fundamo and Monitise are both software solutions that help bridge some of those gaps.
323;V;Visa Inc;2011-05-31T21:09:55Z;Battered Blatter admits Fifa ‘unstable’;;Fifa has become “unstable,” Sepp Blatter admitted as the president addressed the governing body’s annual Congress in the teeth of pressure for reform from several fronts and demands that the election to secure his fourth term of office be postponed.The biggest pressure was brought to bear from the World Cup sponsors. Four of the biggest sponsors – Coca-Cola, Adidas, Visa and Emirates Airlines – have now gone public, calling on Fifa to act swiftly to restore its damaged reputation in the face of the bribery allegations that have sparked an internecine struggle between the governing body’s most powerful figures.Meanwhile, the English and Scottish Football Associations began lobbying others in Zurich to support their appeal for the presidential election, to be held on Wednesday, to be halted.This position was also backed by Prince William, who is the president of the FA. A statement from St James’ Palace said the prince “is fully supportive of the chairman and the initiatives the FA has recommended. He considers the transparency of the international governing body to be integral to the good governance of the game.”Although it has little chance of success, it could at the very least offer some associations a way of expressing their dissatisfaction at the turn of events and the president’s handling of them.The European Commission, which has a say in how Fifa’s European TV rights are awarded, also made clear its displeasure in a thinly veiled attack on Mr Blatter.Androulla Vassiliou, the commissioner responsible for sport, said: “The situation at Fifa is a concern for many of us and I have confidence that the current issues will be thoroughly investigated and resolved as soon as possible.“Football and sport in general need good leadership and governance, above suspicion and firmly rooted in accountability and transparency.”Mr Blatter, in a sombre address to the 208-member Congress, said: “”I thought that we were living in a world of fair play, respect and discipline …I must unfortunately say this is not the case.“Because our pyramid, our famous Fifa pyramid, is unsure of its base and there is a danger. So tomorrow at the congress, I will speak of this danger that is there lurking and how we can react against this threat of danger so that our sport can play its role in bringing people together.”His re-election on Wednesday now seems assured, but will not come without some opposition. David Bernstein, president of England’s FA, said there was a matter of principle behind its call for the postponement of the election to allow for an alternative reform candidate to stand.“Myself and the FA feel that the situation FIFA has got itself into is in many ways unacceptable,” he told reporters. “Going forward in this situation if he does with a coronation rather than an election I don’t think does anybody any good - including Mr Blatter.”Mr Bernstein, who said he had kept the UK government informed of its strategy, claimed there was “latent support” for its postponement call, and was not worried about being portrayed as isolated in Fifa.The sponsors’ discontent may be of greater concern to Mr Blatter. Emirates Airlines said it was “disappointed with the issues that are currently surrounding the administration of the sport” while Visa, the credit card company, said the “current situation is clearly not good for the game”.Most observers believe Fifa should pursue the same structural reform International Olympic Committee more than a decade ago, following the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.Jacques Rogge, IOC president, addressing the Congress, said Fifa was now facing “allegations and controversies.”He said: “Thirteen years ago we had to face the same ordeal in the Salt Lake City case. The IOC ultimately however emerged a stronger organisation - and from within. Our past of course calls for humility and I will definitely not point the finger or lecture you. I’m sure that Fifa can emerge stronger, and from within.”Mr Blatter is the only candidate following the withdrawal of Mohamed bin Hammam at the weekend in the face of bribery allegations surrounding his election campaign.
324;V;Visa Inc;2011-05-24T17:31:54Z;EU eyes curtailing visa-free travel;;Visa-free access to the European Union’s Schengen area could be curtailed for some non-EU citizens under plans unveiled on Tuesday.The European Commission said a “safeguard clause” to suspend current visa-waiver programmes was necessary to prevent abuses where migrants used travel privileges and then seek political asylum in EU countries.Diplomats said countries from the western Balkans, among the latest to join the visa-waiver schemes in the last two years, were the most likely to the target of suspensions following influxes of asylum applicants in EU countries.Nearly 18,000 Serbian nationals last year sought political protection in the EU, the largest number from any country after Russia and Afghanistan. More than 6,000 Serbs arrived in Germany and Sweden, with Belgium taking in 2,220.Many of them are Roma or Albanians who claim persecution, although not all cases result in political asylum being granted.The sudden rise has prompted disquiet among EU countries.One diplomat involved in the talks said: “It is perhaps the case we went a little bit too fast in some cases [granting visa waiver] and now we want to be able to reconsider that, in light of recent experiences”.Under the proposals, to be approved by EU governments, the Commission would be able to suspend visa-free travel rapidly upon the request of one or more member states.Cecilia Malmström, EU home affairs commissioner, said the proposal could lead to more – not fewer – visa-waiver programmes in the future.She said “I hope that this will help increasing the member states’ confidence and will introduce more visa-free regimes in the future”.She stressed that the suspensions would occur only in “exceptional and very strict circumstances”.Removing visa-waiver privileges from a country is possible under the current rules, but the cumbersome procedure can take several months, if not years.The Commission’s proposal comes as the EU considers ways to recast the functioning of the Schengen area, in which citizens can travel without a passport.Some member states, notably France, are pushing for a mechanism to reinstate border patrols in some instances. National leaders will discuss the issue at a summit in Brussels on June 24th.The Commission also put forward a package of measures aimed at managing migration flows from North Africa, after a surge of arrivals following political unrest in the region.Brussels wants to open a wide-ranging “dialogue for migration, mobility and security” with Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt, including more possibilities for their citizens to legally reach Europe in exchange for help from those countries in combating illegal migration.More than 30,000 Tunisian migrants have reached European shores since February. Civil strife in Libya has also caused an increase in the numbers of arrival from its coast, many of them laden with sub-Saharan Africans entitled to seek refuge in Europe.
325;V;Visa Inc;2011-05-20T22:12:58Z;Mobile phone pay system launches in UK;;The first mobile phone payment system has been launched in the UK.Shops and restaurants including Eat, Pret A Manger, McDonald’s and some Boots stores will be fitted with Barclaycard readers allowing customers with a specially adapted Orange handset to purchase small items by swiping their phones.Users will first have to load their phones with money from their accounts, in increments up to £100, and will then be able to use it to buy items up to a total purchase amount of £15.The machines will be available in about 50,000 stores across the country.Contactless mobile phone payment has been promoted as the future of payments by financial services companies for several years.O2 worked with Visa and Barclaycard in 2007 on a piloted scheme to let people use phones instead of Oyster cards on London transport systems.Barclays had previously predicted that by 2012 it would be normal to pay for items with a phone, and that five years later phones would overtake credit cards.But the lack of handsets featuring near field communication, the short-range wireless technology used for the payment systems, has prevented mobile wallets from becoming a mass market phenomenon. So far just one handset will be available with the system.Analysts say take-up of the new payment system in the UK, where consumers already use debit cards to make small payments, may be slow.Mobile phone payment is more popular overseas than in Britain. Japan has more than 30m consumers using a phone payment system called Mobile FeliCa.

327;V;Visa Inc;2011-05-10T22:38:31Z;Hackers’ website comes under attack;;A website used to co-ordinate computer attacks on Sony and other big companies by members of Anonymous has itself come under assault in what security experts and veterans of the organisation see as evidence of a split within the hacking group.The site, AnonOps.net, us­ually lists discussion groups for activities such as “denial-of-service” attacks, which flood targeted websites with meaningless traffic until they cannot be reached by the public.But the site has been defaced with obscenities, and login names and internet addresses of more than 500 people alleged to have taken part in Anonymous activities have been posted on it.Private security experts and veterans of the group said they believed the attack against the site was the result of a split in the leadership of Anonymous that could undermine the organisation’s effectiveness.“Maybe this was due to happen. Anonymous has been surprisingly functional over the last months. It wouldn’t last,” said Mikko Hypponen, chief security officer at Finland’s F-Secure, an anti-virus company.After gaining prominence by targeting the Church of Scientology in 2008, Anonymous has gone on to target government websites in pre-revolution Tunisia, perceived opponents of whistle-blowing site WikiLeaks and recording industry groups it accused of heavy-handed tac­tics in combating digital piracy.The group is amorphous by design, and there are other online gathering places for those who want to participate in its activities. But many of the technical resources of Anonymous were in the hands of a dozen or so “administrators” who controlled computers hosting online chats, said Gabriella Coleman, a New York University professor studying the group.Some of those purported administrators said on other sites and on Twitter that a rebellion was taking place within Anonymous.“We are profoundly sorry for this drama, and we can’t give you an estimate on when service will resume normally,” said a message posted over the weekend on website AnonOps.in and signed by five people calling themselves “the ‘Old’ AnonOps netstaff ”.Some security professionals, who say they are working in a voluntary capacity, have forwarded internet chat logs and internet addresses of alleged Anonymous members to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. These experts said they had fielded questions from the FBI about the alleged rift and about possible leaders on both sides.The FBI is investigating whether Anonymous members were involved in a massive data breach at Sony’s online gaming networks. The FBI and Sony declined to comment.Sony on Tuesday apologised again for the ongoing unavailability of its Playstation Network, saying it would be “at least a few more days” before its digital entertainment services were back online.In messages on their new site, the “Old” AnonOps managers blamed a hacker named Ryan for revealing data on group members. In retaliation, they published what they said was his full name and address. Att­empts by the Financial Times to reach Ryan by telephone and Skype have failed.Someone named Ryan told the online publication Thinq.co.uk he was acting because the old group had become too centralised and hungry for media attention.
328;V;Visa Inc;2011-05-06T21:47:28Z;Wall Street rallies on US jobs;;A volatile week on Wall Street ended on a high note after better than expected employment data pulled investor sentiment from the doldrums and helped energy and materials stocks rebound.Materials stocks saw some of the strongest gains of the session with the S&P materials index up 0.7 per cent, helping to pare some of the 4.5 per cent losses seen earlier in the week due to falling commodity prices.Material stocks had taken a particular battering on Thursday as commodity prices suffered their sharpest one-day fall since the financial crisis.But on Friday, investors speculated that the losses may have been overdone, and the sector rebounded. Cliff Natural Resources was up 1 per cent to $88.93 while Alcoa, the aluminium producer, added 0.8 per cent to $17.15.These gains helped the wider markets snap a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,340.20, still leaving the benchmark index 1.7 per cent lower over the week, however.Sentiment was lifted in the session by strong employment data. The crucial non-farm payroll figures from the labour department showed that 244,000 jobs had been added last month in the US, ahead of the 185,000 that had been expected by economists.The data showed that the government’s work force had fallen in April but that the private sector had more than taken up the slack, adding 268,000 jobs. The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 9 per cent.These data were particularly market moving because a key reason for the losses on Wall Street earlier in the week had been worries that the non-farm payroll numbers would be sluggish.Because of this, the S&P 500 index jumped 1.2 per cent following the figures.But the markets then pared some of these gains after a report in a German newspaper that Greece was considering leaving the eurozone and abandoning the single currency.The S&P energy index was 2.3 per cent higher following the jobs report, paring some of the 7.3 per cent in losses seen earlier in the week, but the index was only 0.4 per cent higher at the close because of the speculation over Greece.In the energy sector, EOG Resources was up 2.3 per cent to $117.44, helped by healthy earnings numbers. Elsewhere in the sector, ConocoPhillips rose 1.4 per cent to $72.94 while Tesoro added 2.6 per cent to $24.91.A number of positive earnings reports also helped to lift sentiment. Shares in Kraft Foods were up 2.1 per cent to $34.08 as the food group reported a rise in revenue and margins.Elsewhere, Visa reported a 24 per cent increase in profits as a result of higher consumer spending and the stock was up 0.9 per cent to $79.41.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent to 12,638.81 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,827.56. The indices were down 1.3 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively over the five days.The markets had opened on Monday in positive territory as the news on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world. But this quickly fizzled out as investors turned their attention to more prosaic matters and began to worry that the market was overbought following the technical highs reached in previous sessions.Late in April, the S&P index achieved a 35-month high, the Nasdaq rose to a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.The sense that the market was overheating was also compounded by weak economic data throughout much of the week. As well as lacklustre employment data on Wednesday and Thursday, the ISM non-manufacturing index showed a sharp decrease in the rate of growth in the US service sector in April.Earnings also failed to give the same lift to the markets as the number of companies beating expectations fell back.Two weeks after the start of the earnings season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent, with slightly less than 100 companies left to report.But the biggest drags on the S&P index over the week were energy and materials stocks as the correction in commodity prices gathered steam. The S&P energy index was down 7 per cent over the week while the S&P material index lost 3.8 per cent.

330;V;Visa Inc;2011-04-27T17:37:52Z;Olympics race is on amid 20m bids for tickets;Opening ceremony more than 10 times subscribed;Tickets for the opening ceremony of the Olympics are more than 10 times oversubscribed and the allocation of certain seats for more than half of next year’s events will have to be decided by ballot, as organisers report strong demand since tickets went on sale six weeks ago.Locog, the London organising committee, said it had received applications from 1.8m people for the 6.6m tickets that went on sale on March 15. The initial indications were that more than 20m tickets were requested.Among the oversubscribed events are the opening and closing ceremonies, track cycling, the triathlon, modern pentathlon, the cross-country equestrian discipline and rhythmic gymnastics, as well as more than half the swimming and tennis sessions.More than half of the 645 Olympic sessions had attracted “some element of oversubscription”, for example excess demand for a specific pricing band, said Locog.Applicants will be told by Locog in June in which sessions they have been successful, although money will begin to be taken from their Visa accounts from May 10.Those who end up ticketless in this phase will be approached by Locog in June and July to determine their interest in unsold tickets in other sessions. A second round of ticket sales will take place in November and December.The deadline for applications closed at 1am on Wednesday: an hour later than planned after a surge in demand caused the ticket website to crash.There have been questions about ticket prices and the process of extracting money before tickets are allocated. But since the Beijing Olympics four years ago, which suffered in part from venues being unable to fill their capacities for some events, Lord Coe, Locog chairman, and Paul Deighton, chief executive, were confident British enthusiasm for sport would ensure high ticket demand.Lord Coe said: “We are thrilled with the response right across the board, in all sports and all sessions.“Certain events have seen massive demand – for example the opening ceremony, which is more than 10 times oversubscribed, so there will understandably be disappointment and we will find a way to go back to those people with other tickets.”
331;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Rush for tickets clogs up Olympic website;;The midnight deadline on applications for Olympic tickets brought a late surge in demand on Tuesday night, causing the 2012 sales website to crash for a while with less than two hours remaining before cut-off.Buyers looking for tickets were confronted by a timer and the message: “We’re experiencing high demand. You will be automatically directed to the page requested as soon as it becomes available. Thank you for your patience.”The London organising committee (Locog) apologised for the delay and said the ticketing system would remain open an extra hour.Earlier, organisers had said they expected to raise £200m ($330m) from the sale of tickets over the past six weeks, boosted by a surge in sales at Easter. They declined to say how many of the 6.6m tickets had been applied for but described sales over Easter as “very strong”.Locog has spent £2m on advertising Olympic tickets. It said it had discovered and passed on to police details of 30 bogus ticket websites.Locog will start to extract money from applicants’ Visa accounts from May 10 and will tell the public which tickets they have obtained by June 24. Ballots are being held for oversubscribed events, with the opening ceremony and the athletics finals likely to be in high demand.Later in the year, Locog will conduct a second programme of sales for unpurchased tickets. In early 2012 it will launch a website for the public to resell tickets at face value.

The $73-a-share cash proposal, which represents a 29 per cent premium to where the shares have traded over the past month, comes after Valeant tried and failed to engage Cephalon’s management and board in takeover discussions.Elsewhere in the sector Merck was up 1.6 per cent to $33.30 while Forest Laboratories rose 4.3 per cent to $32.48. The S&P healthcare index was up 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,328.26 after the ADP National Employment Report estimated that private non-farm employment had risen by 201,000 in March.The figure was broadly in line with expectations, but kept traders’ hopes alive for a strong official employment number on Friday. This was the fourth month where the ADP figure showed about 200,000 jobs being added, compared with the previous four months where the average was 74,000.“In short, there has been a clear and sustained acceleration in private payroll gains,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.The S&P 500 has bounced back 5.7 per cent in the past two weeks as traders have turned their attention to the US domestic economic recovery and away from global tensions.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the marketplace, fell 3.2 per cent in the session to 17.6, falling below 18 points for the first time since the tensions began in Middle East and north Africa in the middle of February.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,350.23 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,776.79.Financial stocks gained ground in the session, led by Visa and MasterCard, following speculation that US curbs on debit card fees will be delayed or modified.Visa was up 2.8 per cent to $74.23 while MasterCard added 0.8 per cent to $253.66 in reaction to comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in the previous session that the central bank would not meet an April 21 deadline to come up with a final rule on debit card transaction fees.Jon Tester, Democratic senator, is also pushing for a chamber vote on a bill that could delay the cap by two years.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs was up 0.4 per cent to $159.07 while JPMorgan Chase added 0.9 per cent to $46.45. The S&P financial sector put on 0.7 per cent.Among telecoms, AT&T rose 2.2 per cent to $30.71 after Randall Stephenson, the chief executive officer, struck an upbeat note, saying that the company’s takeover of T-Mobile USA would boost network capacity and improve service for devices such as the iPhone. He also said that he expected some divestiture before the deal was allowed to go ahead by the regulators.Shares in AT&T are up 9.9 per cent since the $39bn deal, which would create the largest wireless carrier in the US, was announced early last week.These gains helped lift the S&P telecoms index 1.4 per cent in the session with Verizon Communications also gaining ground, up 0.4 per cent to $38.46.Among the individual stocks in focus BlackRock, the world’s largest listed investment manager by assets, gained 6.7 per cent to $198.98 on news that the company was replacing Genzyme, the biotech group, in the S&P 500 index.The stock rallied on the expectation that mutual funds and other investment vehicles that track the S&P 500 index will now buy its shares.Qihoo Technology, China’s largest provider of free antivirus software, traded on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time after an initial public offering. The stock rose 135 per cent on its opening day, to $34, more than double its IPO price of $14.50.Oxford Industries, an apparel maker, climbed 33.4 per cent to $33.37 after reporting an 18 per cent rise in its dividend and strong fourth-quarter earnings.Citrix Systems, the software maker, was up 3.1 per cent to $72.24 after Morgan Keegan & Co initiated its coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating.

336;V;Visa Inc;2011-03-16T11:52:12Z;Best-buy cashback credit card launched;Cash rebates of 1.5% paid on spending;A market-leading cashback credit card which pays rebates of 1.5 per cent on purchases from most major supermarkets and petrol stations, and 0.75 per cent on other spending, has been launched.The new MBNA American Express credit card with cashback is “unbeatable” for people doing a lot of their weekly shopping in major supermarkets, according to consumer group Which?Most cashback credit cards pay rebates worth 0.5 per cent or less.MBNA has also launched a similar Visa credit card which pays 1.25 per cent on supermarket and fuel purchases, and 0.5 per cent on all other card purchases.Both new cards have no annual fees and representative interest rates of 18.9 per cent.Moneysavingexpert.com, the consumer website, which also rates the MBNA cards as “best buys”, calculates that users could earn £100 or more a year in cashback.For example, with the Amex version of the card, someone spending £10,000 a year - with 60 per cent in supermarkets or on petrol - would earn rebates of £120 a year.Retailers categorised as supermarkets include the physical and online stores of Tesco (though not Tesco Direct), Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Waitrose and Ocado, while qualifying petrol stations include BP, Shell, Esso, Texaco, Q8 and supermarket fuel outlets.However some big retailers that sell food, such as Marks & Spencer, are not categorised as supermarkets, so spending only qualifies for the lower cashback rates.
337;V;Visa Inc;2011-03-16T02:26:13Z;Battle over US debit card fees;;A proposed delay to rules that would force Visa and MasterCard to cut the costs of debit card swipe fees was slapped down on Tuesday by Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate.Members of Congress from both parties are trying to amend, delay or kill a rule that limits the cost of “interchange” fees to 12 cents per transaction, a reduction of more than 70 per cent, which caused shares of the payment networks to fall by more than 10 per cent when it was announced in December.John Tester, Democratic senator from Montana, introduced legislation on Tuesday with eight bipartisan co-sponsors that would delay the implementation of the rule by two years while a broad group of regulators look again at the issue.He said he was worried that small banks and consumers would be hurt inadvertently, and cited the criticism it has attracted from regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Mr Tester said he had detected “buyers’ remorse” among colleagues who had supported the interchange amendment. But Mr Durbin, who sponsored the provision as part of last year’s financial regulatory overhaul and is backed by US retailers, stood firm against any delay to the rule.“I will strongly oppose any attempts to line the pockets of the credit card giants and Wall Street banks by delaying this common-sense, pro-consumer legislation,” he said.Tim Johnson, chairman of the Senate banking committee, whose state of South Dakota is a base for financial services companies, said he was “still reviewing the [Tester] legislation” and would work with lawmakers and regulators to “find the best solution”.However, he added: “At the same time, I want to make sure we don’t open the doors to the misguided efforts aimed at repealing the entire Wall Street reform law.”Others close to the Senate leadership said it was unclear whether Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, would ever allow the measure to come to a vote.The best chance for a change to the rule now lies with the Federal Reserve, which has until April 21 to produce a final version. However, Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, has told lawmakers that they have left the central bank with little leeway in their wording of the law.“While early indications are slightly encouraging, they are not enough to get materially more optimistic on the stocks of Visa and MasterCard just yet,” wrote Adam Frisch, analyst at Morgan Stanley, in a note to clients.“Despite the fact that a legislative fix seems more possible today, we are still not counting on it and continue to view potential litigation and industry fixes as more viable.”
338;V;Visa Inc;2011-03-09T20:17:38Z;Proposed rule to cut debit card swipe fees is stalled;;"A controversial rule to cut debit card swipe fees would be delayed and kicked back to regulators for more study under new legislation set for a US Senate vote next week, according to congressional aides.Shares in Visa and MasterCard slumped by more than 10 per cent when the Federal Reserve announced in December a proposal to limit the “interchange” fees charged to retailers for the use of debit cards to 12 cents a transaction, a 70 per cent decline from current levels.Large and small banks have joined the network operators in the biggest lobbying effort since last year’s passage of financial reform in a bid to prevent the rule coming into force.The financial institutions argue that consumers will bear the price of any reduction in interchange fees through debit cards that are more expensive and less available. Some banks have already started to charge a monthly debit card fee and eliminate reward programmes.“We’re very appreciative of members’ willingness to step back and understand how this harms consumers, community banks and all members of the financial sector,” said Ken Clayton of the American Bankers Association.John Tester, a Democrat from Montana, and Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, are leading an effort to stall the implementation for up to two years and allow other regulators to participate in the rule-writing.“Senator Corker doesn’t believe the federal government should be telling private companies what they can charge for goods and services,” said a spokeswoman for the senator.The Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have both criticised the Fed’s rule, while Ben Bernanke, chairman of the central bank, has acknowledged problems but suggested that Congress left it little alternative.Participation of the other banking regulators in the rule-writing could increase the fee limit and include a more workable exemption for smaller banks, which the industry and its regulators say are likely to be particularly hard hit by a reduction in a key revenue stream. The OCC has said the issue is a threat to “safety and soundness”.But a legislative change is by no means certain. The interchange amendment was the signature contribution to financial reform by Dick Durbin, a powerful Democratic senator from Illinois. Fellow Democrats say that they have detected no willingness to soften the rule from Mr Durbin, who is supported by US retailers.The merchants argue that any delay in implementing the rules will hurt consumers. Since retailers already pass on much of the cost of interchange to customers in the form of higher prices; they say a delay in capping the fees will result in consumers paying an extra $1bn a month at the tills.According to a report by Compass Lexecon, a consulting firm, the five countries with the largest debit card use per capita have no “swipe” fees at all. They include New Zealand, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Denmark. The European Union has also moved to cap the fees."
339;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Credit and debit card fraud falls;Card fraud is at its lowest level for a decade;Credit and debit card fraud is at its lowest level for a decade, following intense action taken by banks to crack down on losses.The total losses recorded by the UK Cards Association and Financial Fraud Action UK for 2010 were £365.4m, almost half that recorded in 2008 when card crime hit an all-time high of £610m.UK banks have been employing increasingly more aggressive tactics to deal with credit and debit card fraud, freezing payments if card usage appears even slightly irregular.Card users who travel abroad are now required to inform their bank ahead of the trip or run the risk of their card not working. As a result fraud committed abroad has more than halved in the past two years.And despite the rise in so-called “phishing” attacks, which target online users with emails purporting to be from their provider or other trusted source, online banking fraud fell by over a fifth in 2010 from the previous year to £46.7 thanks to an increase in the use of sophisticated fraud detection software by banks and customers becoming more aware of the need to ignore such emails.Unsurprisingly cheque book fraud losses have fallen, reflecting the gradual elimination of cheques for financial transactions, but phone banking fraud has risen by 5 per cent as criminals realise that online contact with potential victims yields less results.Card providers attribute the fall in fraud to the use of fraud detection systems by the banks and card companies, which monitor for unusual spending, and the roll out of chip and PIN machines abroad. A number of banks now use additional measures such as MasterCard’s SecureCode or Verified by Visa, which requires card users purchasing items to enter extra security information.The Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit, an industry-sponsored specialist police unit set up in 2002 to deal with fraud, recommends that customers employ simple methods such as shielding their PIN entry and checking that their personal computer has up to date anti-virus software.Provided they have acted with reasonable care UK victims of card fraud are entitled to protection by the Banking Code. In most cases providers will refund the full amount stolen.Overall card and banking fraud accounts for just one per cent all fraud committed in the UK, which is estimated by the National Fraud Authority to cost the country over £38bn each year.
340;V;Visa Inc;2011-03-01T02:28:28Z;JPMorgan faces up to $4.5bn costs;;JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries face more than 10,000 legal proceedings that could ultimately cost as much as $4.5bn beyond what the bank has already set aside in reserves.The financial crisis left a raft of litigation in its wake, as regulators, investors, counterparties and borrowers found fault with lenders’ actions on everything from lending and packaging mortgages to selling auction-rate securities and serving as banker to Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff.The US Securities & Exchange Commission has urged banks recently to disclose forecasts for legal losses under certain worst-case scenarios. Last Friday, Citigroup and Bank of America estimated that losses from pending litigation could exceed their reserves by billions of dollars.In the New York-based lender’s annual report, filed on Monday, JPMorgan said it was “reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to $4.5bn at December 31.”JPMorgan based its range “upon currently available information,” and relied on “significant judgment” given that many cases remained in their preliminary stages, the bank said in its filing.“We believe we’re fully reserved for our probable losses,” a JPMorgan spokesman said.The bank does not disclose its current legal reserves, although it has noted it set aside additional funds in 2010.For financial companies that acquired troubled institutions that were unlikely to survive the crisis, the cut-rate deals also came with additional legal headaches. JPMorgan added Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, and faces actions stemming from each purchase.American Express said on Monday that losses related to various lawsuits could total as much as $500m more than what the company had already set aside to cover those liabilities.Amex is the target of a civil antitrust suit brought by the Department of Justice, which alleges that Amex prevents merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payments. A hearing on the matter is set for March 2. MasterCard and Visa last year settled similar DoJ charges.Morgan Stanley did not include a similar range of forecast losses in the “legal proceedings” section of its annual report, which was also released on Monday.The investment bank said its traders reported losses on 38 days in 2010, the same number of money-losing days they produced a year earlier.The traders generated at least $100m in daily revenues on 25 occasions, Morgan Stanley said in its filing.
341;V;Visa Inc;2011-02-24T17:22:25Z;US arrests Saudi national for trying to build bomb;;US authorities have arrested a Saudi Arabian citizen living in Texas on charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and potentially targeting former President George W. Bush.The arrest, announced on Thursday by the US Department of Justice, came after authorities said they had determined Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, a 20-year-old who entered the US legally on a student visa, had been “actively researching” online how to construct an improvised explosive device.US authorities said Mr Aldawsari had moved to acquire most of the ingredients and equipment required, had researched several US targets and allegedly described his desire for violent “jihad” and martyrdom in blog postings and a personal journal.The DOJ said that searches of his apartment conducted by the FBI in February 2011 indicated that the concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids, beakers and flasks, wiring and clocks were present in his residence.Mr Aldawsari, who is enrolled at South Plains College near Lubbock, Texas, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.According to the DOJ affidavit, electronic surveillance revealed that Mr Aldawsari allegedly used various email accounts to research explosives and targets and often sent himself emails containing that information.On February 11, he allegedly emailed himself a recipe for picric acid, described as a “military explosive.’’He also allegedly emailed himself instructions on how to convert a cell phone into a remote detonator and prepare a booby-trapped vehicle. The affidavit alleges he conducted research about using dolls to conceal explosives.The affidavit alleges Mr Aldawsari sent himself an email entitled “Tyrant’s House’’, listing the Dallas address for former President Bush. In other emails he listed a reservoir and hydroelectric dams, as well as nuclear power plants, as potential targets.Mr Aldawsari’s journal allegedly indicated he had been planning a terrorist attack in the US for several years. One entry described how he had obtained a scholarship because it brought him to the US and helped him financially, which he allegedly said, “will help tremendously in providing me with the support I need for Jihad.’’The entry continued: “And now, after mastering the English language, learning how to build explosives and continuous planning to target the infidel Americas, it is time for Jihad.’’The authorities said they were tipped off by a chemical supplier, which reported a suspicious order of concentrated phenol. Phenol can be used to make the explosive trinitrophenol, also known as TNP or picric acid.“This case serves as another reminder of the need for continued vigilance both at home and abroad,’’ said David Kris, assistant attorney general for National Security.
342;V;Visa Inc;2011-02-24T01:57:37Z;FDIC hails cuts in loan loss provisions;;Big banks cutting their loan loss provisions capped a “turnround” year for the industry in 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Wednesday, as its chairman called for more lending.Sheila Bair said the industry had recovered from the dark days of 2008 and called on healthy banks to extend more credit. “Banks need to get back to the basics of making loans,” she said.The FDIC, which guarantees consumers’ deposits up to $250,000 and supervises much of the country’s smaller banks, said the industry’s profits increased from a net loss of $1.8bn a year ago to $21.7bn in the fourth quarter, mainly as a result of fewer reserves being set aside for loan losses.Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at MF Global, noted that with seven large institutions accounting for more than half of the reduction in the provisions for losses, the improvement did not mean medium-sized banks did not “still have credit quality issues to resolve”.Loan balances fell, according to the FDIC’s Quarterly Banking Profile, with construction loans down 28.7 per cent year on year to $321.5bn as banks worked through their losses in the troubled sector and the stagnant housing market continued to weigh on new loans. But loans to businesses and individuals increased modestly.Investors’ return on equity became positive in 2010, the data show, but at about 6 per cent remains at less than half the level of the years before the crisis began to take hold in 2007.“I’m hoping that as we emerge from this crisis that investors will appreciate the trade off perhaps with somewhat lower ROEs with more sustainable, less risky long-term business plans and bank management,” said Ms Bair.New regulations are crimping banks’ profits and investors’ returns. Deposit account fees fell 20 per cent for the second quarter in a row, while Ms Bair said more needed to be done to ensure that small banks could escape proposals to limit the fees charged on debit card transactions.She said there were “broader issues” about the impact of the so-called interchange fee cap, which is being drawn up by the Federal Reserve, but MasterCard and Visa might have to be corralled into helping enforce an exemption for smaller institutions.“We’re looking at, [with] the current authorities, whether the Fed can require the networks to do two-tier pricing,” she said. “That would be one possible way to fix this.”The FDIC closed 157 failing banks in 2010, the report said, but Ms Bair noted that the rate of failure was slowing. The number of institutions on the FDIC’s problem list rose from 860 to 884 in the fourth quarter.
343;V;Visa Inc;2011-02-17T20:08:09Z;Fed plan to cap card fees contested;;The US Federal Reserve came under sustained pressure in Congress on Thursday to alter, delay or abandon a plan to cap debit card fees, which has rocked the shares of Visa and MasterCard.A proposed rule from the Fed would limit the fees charged to retailers to 12 cents a transaction, a move cheered by the likes of Walmart but fiercely opposed by banks and card companies.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged that a proposed exemption for smaller banks from the mooted cap might not work. “It is possible that because merchants will reject more expensive cards from smaller institutions . . . that exemption will not be effective in the marketplace,” he told the Senate banking committee.Community banks are a powerful force and their lobbying effort was evident in the questions asked by lawmakers in the Senate and a parallel hearing in the House financial services committee on Thursday.Jeb Hensarling, a Republican representative from Texas, said: “My mailbox is full from community banks telling me this is going to harm their bottom line.”Ed Royce, a Republican from California, said it “could be the final nail in the coffin for many of the smaller institutions”.Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said she was “sceptical” that small banks would in practice be exempt from the rule and were likely to increase the fees they charge customers on accounts. “That would not be helpful for consumers,” she said. “This really needs to be fixed.”In apparent criticism of the Fed, Ms Bair said “who’s going to pay more, who’s going to pay less . . . [wasn’t] dealt with as thoroughly as it might have been”.Although the Fed’s rule was much tougher than expected and has come under attack from Democrats and Republicans, it has a powerful champion in the Senate in the form of Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois, and legislation to change it looks unlikely.More likely is a change by the Fed in the proposal to mollify small banks, although Mr Bernanke said Congress might need to consider legislation. “One way to address it, if Congress wants to, is [to] require the networks to differentiate [between large and small banks],” he said.Both Visa and MasterCard, which operate the networks, collect fees and pass them on to card-issuing banks, saw their shares fall by more than 10 per cent in December when the Fed announced the proposed rule.Joshua Floum, Visa’s general counsel, said the proposal “represent[s] a direct attack on American consumers and this nation’s financial institutions, and their combined efforts to recover from the worst economic conditions this country has faced since the Great Depression”.But David Seltzer, vice-president of 7-Eleven, the convenience store chain, accused the card companies of levying charges well beyond their costs on retailers and supported the rule that would dramatically curb such charges.“This conversation illustrates the fact that interchange rates are not set to cover the reasonable costs of running the clearing system,” he said.“Rather, they are a tool to encourage banks to issue more and different card products at the expense of our franchisees and our customers.”
344;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Banks in plea over card fees cap;;The US financial sector will on Thursday urge Congress to delay the implementation of new rules that cap debit card fees which could cost banks and card processors billions of dollars.Visa’s general counsel and the chief executive of Commerce Bank are among those scheduled to urge a House of Representatives subcommittee to delay the application of the rules, which would reduce the fees merchants pay to banks each time a debit card is swiped.The executives are expected to argue that Congress did not have sufficient time to evaluate the potential effects of the new regulations, which were added as a last-minute amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act. “This was a rushed process that led to flawed results that could have unintended consequences for consumers,” Joshua Floum, Visa’s general counsel, told the Financial Times.Merchants have been lobbying Congress for years to curb the fees, which they say amount to price-fixing and which they claim have grown disproportionately heavy.Dennis Lane, owner of a 7-Eleven store in Quincy, Massachusetts, claimed that debit card processing fees had increased 500 per cent over the past decade, which made some transactions unprofitable. For example, he makes about 6 cents each time his store sells a USA Today newspaper, but he must pay the debit card issuing bank double that amount on the sale.“We’re not looking for a free ride, just for fees that are fair and reasonable,” said Mr Lane.Banks argue that curbs would result in higher costs for their customers. Some lenders have already eliminated free checking and reward programmes in anticipation that the rules will be implemented this year.However, their arguments have failed to sway consumer advocates.“When banks charge fees that are not transparent they are getting money unfairly,” said Ed Mierzwinski, a director of US PIRG, a federation of public interest groups.Although Barney Frank, the ranking Democratic member of the House financial services committee, has said that he would be willing to work with the Republican majority in the lower chamber to rethink the new rules, some analysts say that the odds of the banking industry getting the law repealed remain low.That is because the Democrats still control the Senate, where Richard Durbin, the influential author of the “swipe” fee rules, in all likelihood has the power to block any attempt to roll back the legislation.In a letter to the American Bankers Association, Mr Durbin said that the rules were designed to fix a system that “massively overcompensate[s] banks at the expense of merchants and their customers”.

GIC declined to comment and CIC could not be reached.AIG and the US Treasury declined to comment.The share sale is the first attempt by the US Treasury to reduce its 92 per cent stake in AIG, which is worth about $69bn at current prices. The authorities received the shares in exchange for repeated bail-outs of the insurer during the turmoil.The involvement of state-controlled funds, which typically take large minority stakes in a company, would make it easier to get the process off to a good start. AIG’s plan to raise funds at the same time as the Treasury could also be facilitated by investments from sovereign funds.However, a large presence by sovereign wealth funds on AIG’s share register could raise concerns in Washington, especially if they were allowed to buy at a lower price than other share offer participants.People close to the situation said the preferred option for the government and AIG would be to let sovereign wealth funds participate in the share sale without special treatment.However, some sovereign wealth funds are expected to drive a hard bargain and demand a discount on the general share price in exchange for giving their blessing to the offering by becoming large “anchor” investors.Sovereign funds’ response to the US authorities’ entreaties will be a gauge of their renewed interest in the US financial sector, especially because after divestments AIG is largely a domestic company.Sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East and Asia have become the first stop for any large equity offer, from AIG to General Motors to Visa. But in the wake of the financial crisis, they have become much more sensitive to price.Additional reporting by Kevin Brown in Singapore
346;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Mastercard posts strong net income;;Mastercard’s fourth-quarter net income jumped 41 per cent, driven by the first positive growth in US consumer credit card spending in nearly three years.US consumers spent $135bn on Mastercard-branded credit cards in the fourth quarter, a 2.2 per cent increase over the prior year, and the first growth in 11 quarters.Ajay Banga, Mastercard’s chief executive, said that spending on both necessities like groceries and non-necessities like restaurants and travel had returned to pre-recessionary levels. But he said he remained cautious on future US growth barring improvement in key economic factors.“It’s hard to see sustained growth until unemployment and the housing market improves,” Mr Banga said.Mastercard’s fourth-quarter net income totalled $415m, or $3.16 a share. Wall Street analysts had been expecting the company to earn $3.04 a share. Revenue climbed 11 per cent to $1.4bn.Worldwide gross dollar volume on Mastercard-branded credit and debit cards grew 11 per cent to $752bn. Cross-border volume increased 18.7 per cent, the strongest growth in 10 quarters, said Martina Hund-Mejean, Mastercard’s chief financial officer.Improvements in Mastercard’s operational results were overshadowed by new regulations that could curtail the fees that banks collect from merchants each time their debit card is swiped. Investors are concerned that banks will try to renegotiate the fees they pay to Visa and Mastercard for use of their networks to help offset declining merchant revenue.Mr. Banga said that the impact of the changes to Mastercard’s debit revenue would be “manageable”. But he added that the consequences for consumers were serious. “Consumers stand to bear these additional costs and in some cases face a loss to banking services,” Mr Banga said.Mastercard, along with larger rival Visa and card-issuing banks have been lobbying Congress to rethink the rule before it takes effect later this year.The fight among the card networks and banks with large merchants like Walmart and Target over these so-called “swipe” fees has been brewing for years. In 2003, Mastercard agreed to pay $1bn over 10 years to settle a class action lawsuit against itself and Visa brought by large merchants.On Thursday, Mastercard said that it had reached an agreement with Visa and card issuing banks who are defendants in another merchant-driven lawsuit that would limit any damages that Mastercard would be required to pay in the event of a settlement to 12 per cent of the total. A trial date for that case had not yet been set.Visa reported similarly strong results and concerns over the regulatory environment when it reported earnings Wednesday evening.

Should the proposed UK visa system reform take effect, this could have a significant impact on the competitiveness of UK business schools.”The concerns are the latest expressed in the UK business school industry about government plans to restrict student visas and to remove the automatic right for all non-EU graduates to work in the UK for two years on graduation. Both the UK industry bodies, the Association of MBAs and the Association of Business Schools, along with many UK business schools, submitted their concerns in writing to the Border Agency as part of its consultative process which ended in January.According to the latest study from GMAC, 11 per cent of aspiring students who took the GMAT in 2010 had those scores sent to European schools, compared to 7.5 per cent in 2006. In total, European business schools received 85,262 score reports from people who took the GMAT exam in 2010, up 90 per cent from the 45,079 score reports test takers sent to European institutions in 2006.www.gmac.com
348;V;Visa Inc;2011-02-03T02:20:51Z;Visa volatility over regulation fears;;Visa’s shares suffered share price volatility in spite of strong results from the first quarter, as investors remained concerned about how new debit card restrictions would affect the company’s revenue.Visa is playing a leading role in an industry-wide effort in the US to delay the implementation of new rules that would limit fees banks collect from merchants each time their debit card is swiped.Joseph Saunders, Visa’s chief executive, said in a conference call late on Wednesday to discuss the company’s first-quarter earnings: “The enactment of this legislation should be delayed and the unintended consequences should be studied.”Following the release of its results on Wednesday, the shares fell $1.09, or 1.51 per cent, to $71 in after-hours trading, before recovering the lost ground on Thursday morning.Banks say the new rules, which the Federal Reserve is in the process of writing, will result in higher costs for consumers. Large merchants such as Wal-mart and Target, which aggressively lobbied for the passage of the rules as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, say banks have overcharged them on debit card purchases for years.The debate over the fees overshadowed Visa’s first-quarter earnings, which increased 16 per cent on a continued rebound in consumer spending.The San Francisco payment processor earned $884m, or $1.23 a share, in the most recent three months, 2 cents more than Wall Street analysts had expected. Spending on Visa cards jumped 15 per cent to $897m compared with the prior year. Total transactions processed were $13bn, also a 15 per cent increase over the year-ago quarter.The new rules may loosen Visa’s and MasterCard’s grip on the debit market by requiring cards to use at least two networks, potentially opening the door to competition from rivals.The draft proposal would limit the fees set by Visa and MasterCard that merchants pay to card-issuing banks to 12 cents a transaction, an 80 per cent cut over current levels.Mr Saunders said: “We believe the government is engaged in price fixing to the benefit of no one”.To offset the lost revenue, banks have said they will start charging a monthly fee for debit cards and limit the size of transactions.J. Craig Shearman, vice-president for governmental affairs for the National Retail Federation, said: “The banks are about to lose a huge revenue stream and they are trying every last ditch effort to continue skimming money out of consumers’ pockets”.Several congressmen recently signalled that they would be open to revisiting the rules, including Barney Frank and his successor as the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Spencer Bachus, who has scheduled a tentative hearing on the matter for February 17.
349;V;Visa Inc;2011-01-30T19:52:32Z;Visa and MasterCard warn consumers over fees;;Visa and MasterCard are spending tens of thousands of dollars on a soon-to-be-unveiled public awareness campaign designed to educate consumers on the perils of new debit card restrictions, according to people familiar with the plan.Working with major credit card issuers and smaller community banks, Visa and MasterCard are taking advantage of a rare opportunity potentially to delay the implementation of the new restrictions, which would limit the fees that banks charge merchants each time their debit card is swiped.Banks claim the changes could cost them $12bn a year in lost fees, while benefiting large retailers such as Walmart and Target.Several Congressmen recently signalled that they would be open to revisiting the rules, which became law last year as a last-minute amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act.Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was one of the architects of the regulatory overhaul, said he would be willing to work with Republicans now controlling the House of Representatives on redesigning the restrictions.Spencer Bachus, who replaced Mr Frank as the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee following the midterm elections, has scheduled a tentative hearing for February 17.The Federal Reserve is currently accepting comments on a proposal to cap the fees at 12 cents per transaction, roughly a 70 per cent reduction from current rates.If finalised, the restriction would be a victory for large merchants, which have long argued that banks overcharge them for processing debit card transactions.“A debit card is nothing more than a plastic cheque,” said J. Craig Shearman, the vice-president of governmental affairs for the National Retail Federation. “It draws money out of the same account as a paper cheque, yet paper cheques clear at face value.”Banks claim that debit cards carry additional costs, including fraud protection and an instant guarantee of payment. They have warned that the cap being proposed by the Fed would only cover one-fifth of those expenses.To make up for the shortfall, some banks say they could add monthly fees to debit cards or restrict their use – ultimately forcing consumers to pay more for everyday banking services.Other perks are also likely to disappear. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, is doing away with a programme that allowed customers to waive current account fees if they used their debit card five times a month.In addition to curtailing bank revenue, the rules would hurt Visa and MasterCard, which set the fees, by potentially opening the debit card networks they run to more competition.

351;V;Visa Inc;2011-01-25T20:44:40Z;‘Wave and pay’ technology for iPhone 5;;Apple is expected to install “wave and pay” technology for the next version of its iPhone, boosting mobile commerce and potentially giving the company a big piece of the multibillion-dollar transaction industry.The iPhone 5, due out this year, is likely to incorporate technology called Near-Field Communication, which incorporates financial account information and ties that data to specific devices, according to Asian suppliers and others who have been in talks with Apple.“I do believe the iPhone 5 will have NFC embedded,” said Bill Gajda, Visa’s head of mobile innovation, one of those in ­discussions with Apple.Apple declined to comment.Samsung and other handset makers who use Google’s Android smartphone software are already putting NFC in new models, and Research in Motion and Nokia are embracing the technology as well.NFC works at a range of four to five inches via point of sale scanners and is considered more secure than RFID and other touchless technologies.Apple could bring the system to a broad audience rapidly by putting it in all versions of its phones. Owners of iPhones are typically heavy users of data and their upscale demographic makes them a desired target for businesses.Apple also brings to the table credit card numbers it has on file for more than 100m users of iTunes, the digital storefront for entertainment and software downloads. That could give it the leverage to extract better terms from card issuers, who typically tack on fees of roughly 2 per cent to retailers who accept their systems.Apple could also decide to go it alone, keeping transactions in-house, said Richard Doherty, an engineering consultant who has spoken with Asian equipment suppliers bidding for inclusion in the next iPhone.Mr Gajda said he hoped that Apple would adopt an “open” strategy that would allow consumers to decide which accounts to tie to their phone.Large retailers who do not yet have NFC scanners would have to spend heavily to switch to new terminals, Mr Doherty warned, though it would be easy for smaller outlets that rent such terminals to start leasing NFC-capable machines instead.US wave and pay trials have, thus far, been small. Visa has been working with some card­issuing banks, for example, who mail small cards with financial credentials that can be inserted into the iPhone and other smartphones.
352;V;Visa Inc;2011-01-21T22:30:50Z;IPO fees;America’s investment banking sector is feeling the squeeze;Some things change slowly, if they change at all. Investment banking’s “bulge bracket” firms have endured two regulatory whirlwinds, two bear markets, and the crucible of the financial crisis. Yet in the decade since the publication of The Seven Per Cent Solution, an academic paper that questioned the suspiciously, consistently high commissions banks receive to manage US initial public offerings, those commissions have barely changed. Deals of under $500m still pay a fee of 6.5 to 7 per cent, according to Dealogic.That is about double the level seen in Europe or Asia, even though most of the same banks are involved. A recent study by Oxford university’s Saïd Business School calculated that the fee differential has cost US businesses some $11.4bn over the past decade.Neither the common sense view, that costs are disproportionate to deal size, nor an aborted federal investigation into possible collusion by banks, has had any effect. But change may now be afoot, courtesy of a bankrupt carmaker and a vampire squid. While fees on recent mega-IPOs such as Visa were over 3 per cent, Goldman Sachs was said to have submitted an unusually low bid to lead manage General Motors’ offering last year. Goldman was facing an investigation into mortgage derivatives and may have figured that it had little to lose. The downside was robbing competitors of fees.The 0.75 per cent fee for the GM deal was the lowest ever for an IPO. It may now be setting the template for the sale of the government’s 92 per cent AIG stake, in which Goldman is a lead manager. The bank may have to divide a rock-bottom fee of 0.5 per cent on what is technically a secondary deal with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.Taxpayers should be pleased. If corporate America can use the precedent as a negotiating tool, it should be happy too. As for bulge bracket bankers, their pockets will bulge a little less.E-mail the Lex team in confidence

They will now be able to use BlackBerry or iPhone smartphones to make payments by presenting a barcode on the phone’s screen to a scanner, instead of the card.Brady Brewer, the head of Starbucks’ loyalty programme, said that one out of five Starbucks transactions were paid for using loyalty cards, which are linked to a rewards programme, and that mobile payment “will extend the way our customers experience and use their card”.The national roll-out of the payment system follows pilots in markets including Seattle, California and New York, and at its outlets in more than 1,000 Target discount stores.The company said its customers loaded more than $1.5bn on to Starbucks loyalty cards in 2010, an increase of 21 per cent over 2009, after it launched its first rewards programme. More than one-third of its US customers use smartphones, of whom nearly three-quarters use BlackBerry smartphone or iPhone mobile devices.Mobile phones have been used to make retail payments in Japan and Korea for several years, using near field communications (NFC) technology, based around a short-range radio-frequency identification tag incorporated into mobile devices. But the technology has yet to establish itself in the US and Europe.Starbucks’ move, based around a unique scannable code delivered by a smartphone app, comes as a variety of payments companies are testing NFC in the US and Europe, amid growing interest from retailers and other merchants.Bling Nation, a California based start-up, is running a pilot payments and loyalty system with a number of merchants and local banks in Silicon Valley that is also in use in the cafeteria of Ebay, the online marketplace that owns the PayPal payment system.Since most US mobile phones are not equipped with NFC tags, Bling Nation is relying on stickers applied to regular mobile phones.Telefónica, the Spanish telecoms company, has said it would use its sponsorship role at the 2012 Olympics in London to promote mass use of NFC in the city, in a partnership with La Caixa, the Spanish bank, and Visa.Visa is also involved in pilots of NFC-equipped phone payments in the New York and Los Angeles public transport systems.

355;V;Visa Inc;2010-12-26T23:35:01Z;Assange signs book deals worth more than £1m;;Julian Assange has signed book deals worth more than £1m in the US and UK, to allow the WikiLeaks founder to cover his legal fees and maintain the whistleblowing site.He will be racing a disgruntled former colleague to release an autobiography telling his side of the WikiLeaks story. Both books are to be published by divisions of Random House next year.Mr Assange is fighting allegations of sexual assault in Sweden while trying to continue the gradual release of thousands of US diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks.Released on bail by the British high court in mid-December, he spent Christmas wearing a tracking tag, confined to a friend’s mansion home in East Anglia.The US administration, which has been angered and embarrassed by successive leaks of its foreign-policy secrets through WikiLeaks, is believed to be exploring ways to prosecute Mr Assange.The controversy did not dissuade readers of Time magazine voting Mr Assange their “person of the year” for his campaign for freedom of information and radical transparency from governments.He has agreed an $800,000 (£520,000) contract with Knopf, a US imprint of Random House, the Bertelsmann-owned publisher, and another £325,000 deal for the UK with Canongate, an independent publishing house based in Edinburgh.But although the deals are expected to net Mr Assange more than £1.1m ($1.7m) after the book is sold in other countries and serialised in newspapers around the world, Mr Assange said he had agreed to write his autobiography only reluctantly.“I don’t want to write this book, but I have to,” he told the Sunday Times. “I have already spent £200,000 for legal costs and I need to defend myself and to keep WikiLeaks afloat.”Mr Assange did not describe how he would divide the proceeds from his autobiography between his own personal legal costs and the operational funds required by WikiLeaks, which he has described as a large and distributed organisation that is not solely reliant on him.WikiLeaks’ operational costs have more than tripled since it drew up budgeting plans at the beginning of the year, due to the increased scope of information it has reviewed and published. Before “cablegate”, it released huge amounts of files about the Iraqi and Afghan wars.The whistleblowing site relies largely on donations from individuals, but had its fund-raising channels curtailed after several US financial services firms stopped processing payments to its account.Bank of America, MasterCard, Visa and PayPal have all stopped directing funds to WikiLeaks in recent weeks. They deny Mr Assange’s accusations that the actions were politically motivated. Mr Assange’s Swiss bank has also frozen his account.Last week, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former WikiLeaks spokesman, announced he would publish a tell-all book next year about his time with the site.Crown Publishing, another division of Random House, will release “Inside Wikileaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World’s Most Dangerous Website” in 14 countries in February.The author, who called himself Daniel Schmitt when he worked at WikiLeaks, fell out with Mr Assange over the running and strategic priorities of the site.He has said that the allegations of Mr Assange’s sexual misconduct would be better handled privately and have become a burden to WikiLeaks.

Our advise is to place your funds somewhere safer.”The site’s founder, Julian Assange, said on Friday that WikiLeaks would continue to release information about the financial services sector in spite of facing “attacks” by banks.“Over the last four years we have published information from over 120 countries,” Mr Assange told reporters outside Ellingham Hall, the English country house where he must remain while released on bail over allegations of sexual offences in Sweden.“It is our normal business to publish information about banks. We have been attacked primarily not by government … but in fact by banks: banks from Dubai, banks from Switzerland, banks from the United States, banks from the UK. So yes of course we are continuing to release material about banks.”In an interview last year, Mr Assange reportedly said that WikiLeaks had many files about Bank of America that have not yet been released.At the same time as facing constraints on its funding sources, WikiLeaks’ budget has been tripled this year, amid ongoing cyber attacks and a greater volume of publications. The US Department of Justice is considering several avenues for potential prosecution of Mr Assange, in the hopes of deterring future leaks.“Over 85 per cent of our economic resources are spent dealing with attacks – dealing with technical attacks, dealing with political attacks, dealing with legal attacks, not doing journalism,” Mr Assange said.Bank of America’s move could prompt reprisals from Anonymous, the loose group of pro-WikiLeaks online activists. Anonymous disrupted websites belonging to MasterCard and PostFinance, the Swiss bank which has frozen Mr Assange’s account, in revenge attacks earlier this month.Lawyers for Mr Assange last week created a new defence fund for supporters to contribute to his legal expenses. Over the weekend, Mr Assange himself suffered the leak of a Swedish police file relating to allegations of rape and other sexual offences from two women, which the WikiLeaks founder has repeatedly denied.The Guardian and the New York Times, newspapers with which WikiLeaks has partnered to examine thousands of US diplomatic cables over recent weeks, both published details of the alleged events in Stockholm last August, based on police interviews.
357;V;Visa Inc;2010-12-17T09:02:23Z;Visa / MasterCard;Shares drop on proposed cuts in debit card interchange fees;A sign of things to come? The Dodd-Frank financial reforms left regulators to decide on the actual details of new rules, and one of the first instalments in that process surprised the market on Thursday afternoon. Shares in MasterCard and Visa both dropped more than a 10th after details of the Durbin report revealed proposals for larger than expected reductions in interchange fees for debit cards – charges associated with processing transactions.The market had anticipated that fees would fall by about 50 to 60 per cent. The Federal Reserve finally decided that the cost of processing a transaction is a mere 7 cents, and so capped the fee at 12 cents.Assuming that the average debit card transaction is about $45, the new rate is a typical charge of 27 basis points. Compared with the current average rate of roughly 120bp, calculates UBS, the new rules impose a 75 cent price cut. Full speed ahead to the cashless economy as swiping a card becomes cheaper than dealing with notes and coins: theft, handling and longer queuing times result in a cost of perhaps 50bp to 100bp.While large retailers will cheer, consumers should perhaps be indifferent. The Australian experience, where interchange rates were cut in 2005, produced little measurable gain for shoppers. Meanwhile banks may react to the hit to their earnings by pulling benefits attached to card schemes, increasing charges or, in extremis, giving up on the business together.Still, in typical regulatory fashion, one can was kicked down the road. The decision on whether to force card issuers to end exclusivity on systems using signature security (as opposed to pin numbers) was deferred until February. Doing so would genuinely open a market dominated by Visa and MasterCard to competition. There may still be some surprises.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
358;V;Visa Inc;2010-12-17T01:25:20Z;Card fee cut hits Visa and MasterCard;;Visa and MasterCard shares plunged after the Federal Reserve proposed rules to eliminate billions of dollars in debit card fees.The new rules, which could still change before they are finalised early next year, are a huge win for large retailers like Walmart and Target, but represent a significant setback for card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, as well as for Visa and MasterCard, which operate the debit card networks.The fees are fixed by Visa and MasterCard and paid by merchants to card-issuing banks to cover the cost of processing transactions.Under the first of two proposals, card issuers would be required to charge merchants no more than their actual costs, which the Fed estimates at 7 cents a transaction. The second proposal would cap the fees at 12 cents a transaction.That is far less than the 63 cents a transaction that issuers currently charge retailers and represents a reduction in debt-card fees of roughly $10bn, or more than 80 per cent, according to the Merchants Payment Coalition.“Today’s draft rule from the Federal Reserve makes it clear that big bank interchange rules overcharge businesses and consumers,” said Senator Dick Durbin, who authored an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act that required the Fed to write new rules capping the fees.“The changes we had to enforce by law in the US are being voluntarily implemented by mega-banks and card giants in Europe and other countries,” Mr Durbin added.The European Commission has reached deals with MasterCard and Visa Europe to reduce interchange fees to 0.2 per cent on cross-border debit card transactions in Europe.The Fed proposal may also loosen the grip of Visa and MasterCard on the debit market by requiring that all cards use at least two networks.Visa and MasterCard on Thursday fell 12.7 per cent and 10.3 per cent, respectively, “due to interchange being lowered more than expected”, Adam Frisch, of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients.Mr Frisch estimated that the fee restrictions will reduce 2012 earnings for Bank of America by 4 cents a share and JPMorgan by 6 cents a share.Banks said any attempt to set rates would lead to higher costs for consumers. Analysts expect banks to react to the new rules by eliminating other services such as reward programmes.“The rules proposed by the Federal Reserve today will have a dramatic impact on the cost of banking services for consumers nationwide,” said Edward Yingling, chief executive of the American Bankers Association.Visa said, “Visa also has concerns that the Federal Reserve’s proposal includes artificial caps on debit interchange that do not realistically reflect the value of card acceptance and do not reflect the actual costs of running a secure, reliable and efficient debit network.”

Earnings came in at $1.16 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.31 and revenue was also lighter than the consensus forecast.But the package delivery company raised its forecast for the fiscal year 2011 on the back of a stronger-than-expected holiday season, much of which was not included in the second quarter. It now predicts earnings per share of between $5.00 and $5.30 for the full year.Shares in FedEx gained 2 per cent to $94.22, helping the wider industrials sector add 1.1 per cent.The stock fell after its reported first-quarter results in September which had more than doubled year-on-year because the company issued a cautious outlook warning of the slowing of economic growth.Rival United Parcel Service also rose, up 2.1 per cent to $73.76.“I’ve always looked at FedEx as a bellwether of US economic activity because they transport goods across the country,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Smart Growth Funds. “They raised estimates on the back of the positive holiday season but is that going to extend
into 2011?”Stocks extended their gains after a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region rose to 24.3 in December, maintaining and adding to gains after a jump to 22.5 the month before.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,242.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 11,499.25 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,637.31.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, down 3,000 to 420,000. But last week’s figures on the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time were revised slightly higher.“This is a modest decline but enough to keep both the four- and eight-week moving averages heading down; the former is now at just 422,750, the lowest since July 2008, before the Lehman bust,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A separate report released before the opening bell showed construction began on more homes in November than in the month before, the first such rise for three months.The S&P 500 homebuilders index added 1.6 per cent to $248.16.Shares in Visa and Mastercard tumbled after the Federal Reserve proposed new rules which could cut the debit card fees paid by retailers who accept the cards by up to 90 per cent. Visa dropped 12.7 per cent to $67.19 and Mastercard lost 10.3 per cent to $223.49.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $12.52 after the bank said investors in some mortgage bonds had agreed to postpone a deadline
for resolving a dispute
over the assets.The biggest truckload carrier in North America, Swift Transportation, edged up 0.9 per cent to $11.10 in its first day of trading. The company had to cut the price of its initial public offering to $806m, or $11 per share, when it had originally offered shares at between $13 and $15 each.In other earnings news, General Mills profits rose 8.6 per cent and shares added 0.6 per cent to $36.59 after the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup missed analyst expectations. Sales volume rose but the company cut prices
to attract cash-conscious
shoppers.Starbucks added 2.3 per cent to $32.59 after analysts at Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the coffee chain by placing it on their “conviction buy” list, saying it has not yet saturated the US market.They gave the stock a $44 price target, 38 per cent higher than the stock’s previous closing price.Meanwhile, Transocean, which fell on Wednesday after it was among the companies that the US government sued over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, dropped further and was down 3.6 per cent to $69.31 after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the oil rig owner from “overweight” to “equal weight”."

361;V;Visa Inc;2010-12-10T19:21:18Z;Anonymous cyberwarriors stun experts;;"Internet subcultures rarely make front page news. But when the mysterious forces of Anonymous took it upon themselves to attack opponents of WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing website, their success took everyone – not least victims such as Visa, MasterCard and PayPal – by surprise.This year has seen military and security experts often warn about the prospects of “cyberwarfare”. Few expected the most prominent assaults against large companies to come from a scattered group of anarchists and idealists with no identifiable leader, membership or nationality.The loose internet grouping that calls itself Anonymous has been notorious in web circles for years, particularly for its apparently random attacks on the music industry, Kiss singer Gene Simmons, YouTube and the Scientologists. Its wilfully illiterate grammar and black humour has permeated the internet far beyond the 4chan messageboard, which originally spawned it.Even as the more serious matters of attacks on big companies were plotted this week, Anonymous followers in 4chan’s open chat rooms chimed in with insults and jokes. But with what it has dubbed “Operation Payback” the group has mounted its most ideological crusade yet.Attempts to scupper WikiLeaks last week, as payment and web hosting companies pulled their support for the site amid intense political pressure, have made Julian Assange, the whistle-blowing website’s imprisoned founder, the pin-up for Anonymous’s campaign against censorship.“WikiLeaks is a litmus test for freedom of speech and freedom of information,” one Operation Payback participant told the Financial Times.Anonymous operates with what to outsiders can look like chaotic abandon.Speaking to the FT, a group of “Anons” – as Anonymous members call themselves – said people of any political stripe were welcome in the group. “Good ideas are good ideas no matter who puts them up,” said one Anon, an American in his late 20s who admits to having limited technical know-how.When issues such as whom to attack are put on the floor of their 24-hour-a-day internet chat rooms, whoever is logged in at the time votes. Some administrators can kick people out of the discussion but chaos reigns.What some would see as infighting, Anons see as a decentralised approach that keeps them fleet of foot.“Having no command structure in Anonymous, we are not vulnerable to having that command structure taken down,” one said. “If someone starts trying to be a ringleader, everyone tells them to shut up. If you jump behind a leader and that leader is taken down, the entire movement is vulnerable.”Just as Anonymous welcomes all who subscribe to its extreme free-speech agenda, it is merciless to those who – like a 16-year-old Dutch member arrested this week – get left behind. “Everyone knows the risks when they step into this,” the Anon said, claiming that he would not be upset if his own bank account details ended up on WikiLeaks. “If my information gets out in the public, that’s my fault.”He said it would “suck” if leaked military secrets caused harm to US troops but that would not sway his beliefs.“The internet is something sacred – don’t screw with it, leave it alone,” he said. “If [authorities] are willing to gun down WikiLeaks in broad daylight, they will come down on you as well. If you join us, you have a voice …Nobody is going to stop Anonymous unless you pull the plug on the internet.”Operation Payback has hit targets far and wide. As well as Amazon, the trader, and payment companies, websites belonging to the Swedish government; the Dutch police; Senator Joe Lieberman, a critic of WikiLeaks; and Sarah Palin, the former US vice-presidential candidate, were targeted.WikiLeaks did not endorse the attacks.Still, Anonymous was able to gather enough support to launch a basic and yet effective strike on the websites of some of the world’s largest organisations.Anonymous encouraged “hacktivists” to download a simple tool – known as the “low orbit ion cannon” – that allows their computers to be used to inundate the targeted website with requests and bring it down.Anonymous said it was not trying to knock over services for the general public, merely the “online public face” of offending organisations.Additional reporting by Mary Watkins and Joseph Menn"

And Facebook and Twitter removed social-networking profiles operated by Anonymous, who have made revenge attacks against services its supporters accuse of abandoning WikiLeaks in recent days.Anonymous has been using social networking sites to co-ordinate its computer assaults in what it calls “Operation Payback”.But its own website and some of its online chatrooms were rendered inaccessible for part of Thursday afternoon. Security experts said it was likely that a denial-of-service attack – whereby a website is flooded with traffic from a large number of computers – had brought down anonops.net, while some internet service providers may be blocking traffic to its chatrooms.In a statement, the Dutch public prosecutor said that its national high-tech crime team in the Hague had remanded a boy in custody, after it discovered that some of the attacks had originated in the Netherlands. The individual, who prosecutors said had confessed to denial-of-service attacks on the payment processors, will appear in court on Friday.The Dutch authorities said that it had confiscated computer equipment and that they were continuing investigating the larger group of hackers they suspected were behind the attacks.The moves against Anonymous, a loose collective of “hacktivists”, did not come soon enough to stop it from briefly disabling websites belonging to Visa, the Swedish government, Senator Joe Lieberman, a vocal critic of WikiLeaks and Sarah Palin, the former US vice-presidential candidate.“Hacktivists” continue to threaten Amazon and PayPal.Anonymous accused Amazon of hypocrisy for selling an e-book version of the WikiLeaks cables just days after stopping its hosting support for the site for breaching its service terms.WikiLeaks operatives have sought to distance themselves from Operation Payback, saying they “neither condemn nor applaud these attacks”.Additional reporting by Stanley Pignal in Brussels
363;V;Visa Inc;2010-12-09T14:37:36Z;Facebook and Twitter remove hackers;;Dutch police have arrested a 16-year-old boy for online attacks on MasterCard and PayPal, after a day of frustration for activists hoping to strike back against perceived opponents of WikiLeaks.Anonymous, the loose group of internet campaigners, claimed credit for disrupting internet the websites of MasterCard, Visa and PayPal on Wednesday and Thursday, but failed to take down Amazon, in spite of threatening the online retailer with a so-called “denial of service attack”.Facebook and Twitter earlier removed accounts operated by Anonymous, who have made revenge attacks against services perceived to have abandoned WikiLeaks in recent days following the release of thousands of confidential US documents.The online campaign, known as Operation Payback, has been using the social networking sites, as well as other chat rooms, to co-ordinate its computer assaults.In a statement, the Dutch public prosecutor said that its national high-tech crime team in the Hague had arrested a 16-year-old boy, after it discovered that some of the attacks had originated in the Netherlands. The individual, which prosecutors said had confessed to denial-of-service attacks on the payment processors, will appear in court on Friday.Twitter and Facebook both removed accounts that appear under the campaign’s name. Operation Payback’s Twitter account linked to a file appearing to contain consumer credit card information before the account was taken offline.MasterCard said that none of its customer data has been compromised and that the credit card numbers were fake.One website belonging to Anonymous also went offline on Thursday afternoon, which some security experts said was due to a deliberate attack on the site.But the moves against Anonymous, a loose collective of “hacktivists”, have not stopped them from disabling websites belonging to Visa and the Swedish government. New social networking accounts have already sprung up in place of those removed by Twitter and Facebook.Amazon and Paypal have emerged as the latest targets for Operation Payback. Amazon has come under renewed criticism from Anonymous for selling an e-book version of the WikiLeaks cables, after pulling hosting support for the site last week.But Operation Payback’s attempts to fell one of the world’s largest online retailers failed, prompting it to turn against parts of PayPal’s online payment service instead.Amazon, PayPal, Visa and MasterCard have all stopped working with WikiLeaks over the past week, each claiming that the site breached its terms of service, rather than acting in response to governmental intervention.Anonymous, working independently from WikiLeaks, has targeted some of these sites, saying it disapproved of anything akin to censorship on the internet. On Wednesday it caused disruption for MasterCard’s online payment processing service on one of the year’s busiest days for online shopping.Sites belonging to Senator Joe Lieberman, a vocal critic of WikiLeaks, Sarah Palin, the former US vice-presidential candidate, and the Swedish prosecutor, who is investigating allegations of sexual offences against Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, have also been overwhelmed with hostile traffic.WikiLeaks itself has been using Twitter and Facebook as the main communication channels, in spite of pressure from US politicians to pull support for the whistleblower site.Facebook said it had pulled down the Operation Payback page because it breached its publishing code.“We take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities seriously and react quickly to reports of inappropriate or illegal content and behaviour. In this case, we removed a page because it was promoting a DDOS attack,” said the website.Twitter declined to comment.In a “manifesto” published online on Thursday, Anonymous said it “most certainly is not a group of hackers”, describing itself as “decentralised” and “similar to a river”. It said Operation Payback was a campaign against those who seek to “misuse the internet” and was directed towards those who “employ unfair means to fight WikiLeaks”.The statement said it did not intend to attack the “critical infrastructure” of Visa and MasterCard, but instead disrupt their corporate websites.WikiLeaks said in a statement that they “neither condemn nor applaud these attacks” by Operation Payback.
364;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;‘Hacktivists’ take revenge for WikiLeaks;;Computer hackers disrupted MasterCard’s online payment processing system for several hours on one of the busiest shopping days of the year as part of revenge attacks on companies that blocked services to WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing website.A group of “hacktivists” known as Anonymous spearheaded the attacks and dubbed them “Operation Payback”.Automated barrages by WikiLeaks’ defenders also temporarily shut down web pages controlled by other companies that have cut connections with WikiLeaks, including credit card network Visa, whose public home page was down for less than an hour. In a statement, Visa said its regular payment processing was unaffected.As government criticism of WikiLeaks’ mass release of US confidential diplomatic cables has intensified, so too has online support for the site, particularly among internet freedom enthusiasts.MasterCard initially blamed problems with its website on heavy traffic but later said some SecureCode services had been disrupted. It reassured customers that core processing capabilities have not been compromised and cardholder account data has not been placed at risk”.But Jon Prideaux, deputy chief executive of SecureTrading, a UK internet payment service provider servicing several large retailers and charities, said SecureCode had been unavailable for up to six hours.“This is one of the biggest trading days in the internet shopping calendar. This is an extremely bad time for this to happen,” Mr Prideaux said.Some technology experts said the disruption of core commerical services by a few thousand individuals could prompt calls for internet service providers to take a more active role in policing their networks and blocking connections from computers identitifed as participating in what are known as denial-of-service attacks.“We need to drain the swamp of malicious activity”, said Andy Purdy, former acting director of the National Cyber Security Division at the US Department of Homeland Security.Twitter, which has not suspended WikiLeaks’ accounts, apparently did drop postings from Anonymous, though they could resume under a new name.The attack comes just a day after Julian Assange, WikiLeaks’ founder, was remanded in custody by a London court until December 14 after Stockholm issued an arrest warrant in connection with alleged sexual offences in Sweden. Mr Assange denies the charges.The hacking free-for-all knocked offline a website of Swedish prosecutors, in retribution for the sex charges that led to Mr Assange’s arrest.There were also attacks on PostFinance.ch, a bank that froze Mr Assange’s accounts, preventing other customers from making transactions for more than 11 hours, according to Panda Security.The official blog at PayPal, which the internet payments processor had used to explain its decision to stop handling donations to WikiLeaks, was shut by denial-of-service attacks for more than eight hours.WikiLeaks itself used a fresh dump of diplomatic cables to hit back at MasterCard and Visa, which has also suspended use of its network. It released a cable that appeared to show US diplomats had lobbied against proposed Russian legislation this year that could “disadvantage” US payment card companies.More traditional lobbying groups such as The Internet Society, an industry body which promotes internet standards and policy, have also leapt to WikiLeaks’ defence.However, WikiLeaks remains defiant, saying that Mr Assange’s arrest will not prevent it from continuing to publish cables.“We will not be gagged, either by judicial actions or corporate censorship,” WikiLeaks said in a statement. It also named Amazon and EveryDNS as companies that had cut links.All of the companies that have suspended their services denied they were subject to political pressure but said that WikiLeaks had violated customer agreements.WikiLeaks has seen its own site come under attack from hackers and has also been forced to shift its main website to a Swiss domain after Amazon threw it off its web host. Last week EveryDNS.net, the company administering its domain name system, terminated its services.Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence, an international group of whistleblowers that includes Daniel Ellsberg, the former US government analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971, also issued a statement in support of WikiLeaks.Mr Ellsberg added: “The truth is that every attack now made on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange was made against me and the release of the Pentagon Papers at the time.”Security experts said that cyber attacks were increasingly being used as a weapon to embarrass large organisations and further attacks were “highly likely”.
365;V;Visa Inc;2010-12-05T22:00:11Z;Amex chief calls for jobs taskforce;;Ken Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, has called for an alliance of business leaders and politicians to find concrete ways to create millions of jobs in the US and kick-start the anaemic economic recovery.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Chenault, who has met frequently with President Barack Obama and his aides, proposed a special commission to set a target for new jobs and specific measures to reduce stubbornly high unemployment.“I’d like to see an industry taskforce between the public and private sectors to determine what businesses need to create jobs,” he said. He added that it would be essential for any public-private taskforce to set a specific target and a timeframe for the new jobs in order to force government and business to take tangible steps to reduce unemployment.Mr Chenault’s proposal was given added urgency by Friday’s official figures showing that employers added fewer-than-expected jobs in November, pushing the unemployment rate to 9.8 per cent of the workforce.The call for a truce between the White House, which has attacked companies’ reluctance to invest in the economy, and a business community that has been calling for more government help, was echoed in other parts of corporate America.The Business Roundtable, the trade organisation for some of the largest US companies including Amex, said Mr Chenault’s proposal was “very intriguing” and could be debated at a meeting of its members this week. The White House declined to comment.Mr Chenault, whose company collects data on millions of retail transactions, said that high unemployment was the biggest obstacle to a faster economic recovery.Amex, the world’s largest credit card company by purchases, fared better than many rivals during the financial crisis, partly because it aggressively restructured its operations, cutting thousands of jobs.Mr Chenault reiterated Amex’s determination to fight a Department of Justice lawsuit that accused the company of violating antitrust laws in October. The DoJ alleged that Amex prevented merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment such as cash, debit cards and credit cards with lower fees. Visa and Mastercard, Amex’s rivals that were also named in the suit, have settled with the authorities, but Mr Chenault has vowed to fight claims that its so-called swipe fees are excessive.

367;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US consumer spending rebounds to pre-crisis levels;;US consumers are beginning to open their wallets and spend at levels not seen since before the financial crisis, according to new data from large credit card processors and economists.Third-quarter results from MasterCard, Visa and American Express pointed to an upturn in domestic spending, with US consumers spending 13 per cent more on Amex credit cards. US spending on Visa credit and debit cards showed a similar increase during the period.Although MasterCard, which reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, showed a slight drop in US spending, much of that decline was due to the loss of big debit card accounts such as Washington Mutual, which shifted business to Visa after it was bought by JPMorgan Chase. Excluding those lost accounts, credit card spending was flat and debit card spending would have increased 15 per cent, said Martina Hund-Mejean, Mastercard’s chief financial officer.Some of those increases are the result of consumers switching from cash to other forms of electronic payments. But even factoring in that shift and the overall sluggishness of the US economic recovery, US consumers are spending at levels not seen since the third quarter of 2007, just before the country plunged into the worst recession in more than 70 years.Consumer spending adjusted for inflation grew 2.6 per cent in the third quarter, faster than economists had predicted. American consumers are now spending about $9,335bn, close to the $9,342bn they spent in the third quarter of 2007.In a sign that the recession has left its mark on consumer purchasing habits, the additional spending is coming from growth in disposable income, which is up 30 per cent from its lows in the fourth quarter of 2007, not from an increase in credit card debt.In fact, consumers continued to pare outstanding debt in the third quarter, which is down 4.3 per cent from its peak in December 2007. Consumers are also saving more, at a rate of 5.5 per cent in the third quarter, up from 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007.“You have a full recovery in income and that, along with the strong performance of the stock market, is helping to bring consumer spending back to levels that existed prior to the slump,” said John Lonski, chief economist for Moody’s Capital Markets.
368;V;Visa Inc;2010-11-02T16:56:04Z;Investors gauge election bounce;;Even though Republicans, touting business-friendly policies, appear set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats, analysts are far from certain about the potential for a positive bounce for the US stock market.Historically, US markets have performed extremely well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year, following the typical loss of seats for the president’s party in the midterm election.The S&P 500 index has not made a total return of less than 10 per cent in such a quarter since 1950, according to figures from LPL Financial. UBS research shows that the year after a midterm, the S&P 500 sees a median price increase of nearly 20 per cent.Stock markets tend to prize political gridlock, believing fewer new regulations will emerge and less government deficit spending will keep borrowing rates low. A study by Fidelity Investments found that large-cap stocks saw average price gains of 23 per cent during the four periods of gridlock – a split in party control of the White House and both houses of Congress – since 1970.Some of those gains will already be priced in, however, in part because gridlock to some degree has been the rule in Washington since Democrats lost their 60th vote in the Senate. Only a surprise Republican seizure of the Senate could be a near-term catalyst for further gridlock-led gains.Other factors will also limit the effect. The largest looming change resulting from increased clout for the Republicans – an agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts, which would lower government revenues by $500bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office – will probably not be resolved to the market’s satisfaction by the election.“The changes may not be permanent,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. “A one-year extension of current tax rates may not be as welcome as a [permanent] resolution of the tax rate uncertainty.”A report on deficits by a bipartisan committee set for December could be a much more important event for clarity on tax cuts, analysts said, as a recommendation to extend would provide cover for Democrats who may face frustration from their own base if they agree to cuts.If such changes do come to pass, higher-yielding stocks could rally as investors look to take advantage of the extended tax break to pocket dividends.“High dividend-paying sectors such as telecoms and utilities may benefit. Cash-rich companies in other sectors may also benefit as they introduce or substantially increase their dividend payout as they look to attract a new class of investors seeking yield,” said Mr Kleintop.Many strategists have argued that the S&P 500 index has been discounted in 2010 due to uncertainty created by the tax expiration, heavier regulation and deficit spending. The S&P has risen just 6 per cent so far this year, even as earnings-per-share are projected to increase 35 per cent this year.Thomas Doerflinger, strategist at UBS, termed recent policies such as healthcare reform, financial regulation, a Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and the tax rises likely to follow from deficit spending, “the Great Suppression”.“It should be positive for equities if the 2010 elections begin a policy shift toward lower taxes, less spending, and lighter regulation,” he said.He warned, however, that the Republican victory would not represent an immediate reversal of the “Great Suppression”. He said he was watching for a “tax holiday” on a repatriation of foreign earnings, which could signal a significant shift in the balance of power.Economists at RBS warned that a sizable victory may also raise expectations of Republican victory in the 2012 presidential election, and could hinder the economy over the next two years.“Hopes of a more business-friendly fiscal agenda, if the Republicans sweep both the presidency and Congress in 2012, could keep companies from aggressively hiring and capital spending near-term,” said Michelle Girard and Omair Sharif of RBS.The circumstances of this election are also historically unique, coming on the eve of what is expected to be a massive intervention by the US Federal Reserve in the form of “quantitative easing”.Bruce Bittles, equity strategist at Robert W. Baird, said the expected election result would not be a strong catalyst itself, instead only raising the relative importance of the Fed as an economic actor.“If we get political gridlock in Washington, as expected, the Federal Reserve will be the one left with any ability to provide stimulus to the economy,” he said.Economists at Société Générale suggested that changing course could unravel the gains seen as “QE2” has been priced in, and from a cheap dollar powering global revenues at multinational groups.“New fiscal stimulus, more likely [if the Democrats retain significant power], could prove potent, particularly when combined with further monetary easing,” they said. “The increased presence of conservatives could lead to premature fiscal tightening, which would be a negative for the economy, and risky assets.”The economy is also not in a typical position. In the 1980s and 1990s, gridlock was prized because it was not to going to upset already strong growth. The 1994 Republican sweep into power in Congress saw the S&P 500 index return 30 per cent in the fourth quarter of that year.The poorest showing for the market after a midterm election was in 1978, when inflation was rampant and investors were frustrated that the government was not cutting spending faster. The S&P rose 12 per cent.In an environment with high unemployment and deflation, gridlock may similarly not be as valuable to the market.Richard Soultanian of Nus Consulting, who advises companies on financial decisions, said: “Gridlock can be a positive when the country’s underlying economy and fiscal situation are in good order.

Earnings per diluted share were $3.94, up from $3.45 last year, and topping the median analyst estimate of $3.54.Revenues, reported net of rebates paid to lenders who use MasterCard’s credit and debit networks, were $1.4bn in the third quarter, up 5 per cent from the same period in 2009.The gross dollar volume of card swipes was up 8.5 per cent to $685bn, which included a 15.4 per cent increase in spending across national borders. MasterCard charges an additional fee to users of its networks for cross-border transactions as it takes on currency conversion risks.Volume in the third quarter declined in the US, its largest market, by 1.7 per cent, which was offset by a 23.6 per cent increase in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Latin America grew by 20 per cent.“Consumers and businesses around the world continue to recognise the benefits of electronic payments and MasterCard remains at the heart of this evolution,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive.MasterCard generates revenues by collecting fees from lenders, such as JPMorganChase and Citigroup, that issue credit and debit cards to consumers that use the MasterCard network.Competition with Visa, Discover and American Express for bank customers has become tougher as a number of large financial institutions consolidated during the height of the financial crisis.MasterCard said that though it raised its prices by about 7 percentage points, that was offset by “a net increase in rebates and incentives due to new and renewed customer agreements”.MasterCard has recently said it wants to compete more directly with non-card payment networks like PayPal, and it acquired DataCash, a UK company, in August.Mr Banga said that in 2011 MasterCard would begin offering a trial of mobile phones-as-credit cards through a large US card issuer. He also said a memorandum of understanding had been signed with China Union Pay to explore mobile payment opportunities.The credit card networks have also been fighting a battle on Capitol Hill, as Democrats led by Senator Richard Durbin inserted an amendment into the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that would limit how much banks can charge to merchants to use their credit cards.Mr Banga said that he expected the US Federal Reserve, which is empowered by the bill to writing new rules on fees, to release its findings in December.That does not directly affect MasterCard and its rivals, but could lead banks to put pressure on them to lower their own fees.Shares in MasterCard were trading 4.6 per cent higher in the pre-market at $250.00. They are down 6.6 per cent year-to-date.
370;V;Visa Inc;2010-10-28T20:54:45Z;US stocks pare losses in late trade;;The industrial sector retreated after 3M said its recent acquisition spree would reduce earnings this year, in an otherwise choppy trading day.The S&P 500 industrials index slipped 0.4 per cent, dragged down by the conglomerate that makes everything from Post-it notes to medical products.3M slumped 6.5 per cent to $84.52 after it said it expected full-year profit to be at the lower end of its previous guidance because of the two security services companies it bought at the end of August.But it posted solid third-quarter results as strong demand from the consumer electronics industry and rising sales in its Asia-Pacific division boosted profit.There was a mixed reception to other companies reporting their earnings, with some stocks falling in spite of positive reports.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,183.67, after fluctuating between positive and negative territory all day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to close at 11,009.71 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,507.37.“I think there’s a lot of hesitation in the markets,” said Jeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James.“They had a big move off the late-June low and I was bullish then and I’ve been bullish since.“But last week I turned a bit more cautious. We’re due for some kind of pause and/or pullback. Not much more than 5 to 8 per cent and then I think we’ll go up.”Strong earnings from ExxonMobil, the largest company by market capitalisation, failed to boost the energy sector, which closed down a fraction.ExxonMobil rose 0.8 per cent to $66.22 after the oil company beat expectations by posting a 55 per cent rise in quarterly profit on the back of higher oil prices. It boosted oil and gas output by 20 per cent compared with the same period last year.Elsewhere in energy, Halliburton tumbled 8 per cent to $31.68 after a US government report into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill said that the company knew that the cement it mixed to seal the well was unstable months before the blow-out.But US-listed shares in BP advanced 1.3 per cent to $40.60.In materials, PotashCorp, the fertiliser company, posted a 62 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings on the back of increasing demand and higher prices for key crop nutrients.US-listed shares in the company, which is the target of a hostile takeover bid by BHP Billiton, fell 3.3 per cent to $142.53 after having risen more than 50 per cent in the past three months.Elsewhere in materials, profit at Dow Chemical was boosted by strong sales in its commodity chemicals unit. Earnings beat expectations but its shares sank 1.6 per cent to $30.72.A rise in shoppers using their credit cards helped Visa beat expectations but its shares dropped 4.3 per cent to $76.45.The payment processing company also authorised a $1bn share buy-back plan. But some investors continued to be concerned about the possible impact of regulatory reform.Shares in Colgate-Palmolive dipped 0.8 per cent to $74.92 after it became the latest consumer products company to issue cautious guidance.Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark both reported earnings in the week and said that the climate for branded goods remained challenging. Colgate-Palmolive, the maker of Ajax cleaner and Colgate toothpaste, beat expectations this quarter but said that its 2011 earnings growth could slow.Motorola added 0.5 per cent to $8.13 after it posted a revenue increase for the first time in almost four years.Rising sales of its Droid handsets, which use Google’s Android operating system, helped the US mobile phone maker beat expectations.Rival Apple lost 0.8 per cent to $305.24 on fears that increased competition for the iPhone could hit future earnings.Before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were unchanged after data showed initial applications for US jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week and the total number of claimants dropped to a two-year low.
371;V;Visa Inc;2010-10-06T22:35:56Z;Fees key to Amex clash with DoJ;;Every time an American Express card is used to make a purchase, the company pockets 2.56 per cent of the transaction price. Those fees, collected from merchants at the point of sale, amounted to $13.4bn last year, by far the largest portion of Amex’s revenue.That revenue is now under attack by the Department of Justice, which on Monday filed a civil lawsuit against American Express. accusing the company of violating antitrust laws. The suit alleges that Amex prevents merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment such as cash, debit cards and credit cards with lower fees.Although Visa and MasterCard agreed to settle the same allegations, Amex has vowed to fight the charges. The DoJ says Amex’s fees are the highest among the big three big card issuers.Merchants have been fighting for years to cap card fees. In a key 2003 lawsuit, Visa and MasterCard agreed to pay large retailers, including Walmart and Sears, $3bn to settle claims that the companies pushed one type of debit card with higher fees over another, less costly, type of card.The issue gained even more steam this summer when a surprise amendment was added to new financial regulations aimed at further reducing debit card fees.The DoJ suit is the latest development in what analysts say is an inevitable march toward lower fees.In spite of the pressure on fees, Amex has increased its dependence on them in recent years. The 2005 spin-off of American Express Financial Advisors, the financial planner now owned by Ameriprise, made Amex even more reliant on the money it collects from merchants. Such fees now account for 55 per cent of Amex’s revenue, up from 34 per cent the year before the spin-off.Amex argues that its prices are justified because it provides merchants with insights into the spending habits of some of the wealthiest consumers. According to payment research group Nilson, the average Amex customer spends $12,000 a year on their card, more than four times what Visa and MasterCard customers spend.“We give merchants access to an affluent, high-spending card member base and there is a price for that,” Amex says.At the heart of Amex’s defence against the DoJ claims is a 2004 Supreme Court decision that forced Visa and MasterCard to allow member banks to issue cards on competing networks. The decision paved the way for Amex, which was seen at the time as an underdog being squeezed by its two larger rivals, to sue Visa and MasterCard and eventually collect billions of dollars in damages.“Back then, the Justice Department was Amex’s friend, but times change,” says Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. “When you are in the position of charging the highest price, you have to be concerned about that price eroding.”Amex has been expanding into other types of business, but so far with limited success. Last year the company created a standalone unit that provides consulting services to corporate clients based on data mined from Amex customers. For instance, it helped Darden Restaurants pinpoint locations for new Red Lobsters and Olive Gardens. Amex does not divulge any information on the business but says it is still a “very small part” of overall revenue. “We’re not abandoning our traditional fee model.”But that model almost certainly will come under increasing pressure regardless of the outcome of the DoJ suit. By settling the DoJ charges against them, Visa and MasterCard have freed merchants to offer customers discounts to encourage them to use cheaper forms of plastic, a move that could eat away at Amex’s market share. “If there is downward pressure on pricing across the board, Amex won’t be immune to that,” says Michael Taiano of Sandler O’Neill.Investors seem to agree. Since the lawsuit was announced on Monday, Amex shares have lost nearly 9 per cent of their value.Although they traded up slightly on Wednesday to about $38 a share, the stock remains well off its high of the past year, last seen in April.But analysts caution the outcome is far from certain. For instance, it is unclear whether Amex will suffer mass defections to cheaper cards or whether the extra incentives on offer, which are among the most generous in the industry, ensures customer loyalty.
372;V;Visa Inc;2010-10-04T23:56:57Z;DoJ sues Amex over ‘swipe fee’ allegations;;The justice department has sued American Express over allegations of anti-competitive policies, while reaching a settlement over the same issues with Visa and MasterCard.Shares in American Express fell 6.5 per cent to a four-month low after the company said it – unlike its rivals – would defend itself against DoJ claims that the “swipe fees” that card companies charge merchants violate antitrust laws.The card industry as a whole collects $35bn a year in swipe fees, which are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, the DoJ said. Of all three companies, Amex charges the highest fees.The settlement with Visa and MasterCard, which requires court approval, will allow merchants to offer consumers discounts or rebates for using less expensive forms of payment, including credit cards without reward programmes, debit cards and cash. Merchants may also disclose the cost they incur by accepting one card over another, and can promote a particular credit-card network. The settlement is similar to legislation passed this summer aimed at lowering debit-card swipe fees.Consumer advocates and Wall Street analysts were divided over the impact of the settlement – both on industry profits and the behaviour of shoppers.“Giving merchants more choices should lead to lower prices for all consumers,” said Ed Mierzwinski, an advocate with the National Association of State Public Interest Research Groups.But JPMorgan analyst Tien Tsin Huang, calling the agreement a victory for Visa and MasterCard, said that he did not anticipate a major change in consumer behaviour, mainly because MasterCard already permits such discounting and Visa will only have to modify its policies slightly to comply. The measure stops short of a tougher plan that would have allowed merchants to impose surcharges on customers who use their Visa or MasterCard.“We want to put more money in consumers’ pockets, and by eliminating credit card companies’ anticompetitive rules, we will accomplish that,” said US attorney general Eric Holder.The settlement potentially puts Amex, the third largest card company by spending behind Visa and MasterCard, at a disadvantage to its bigger rivals. “It can’t be good for competition to allow the largest players to pay merchants to discriminate,” said David Boies, the antitrust lawyer, who is defending Amex in the case.Analysts also warned that issuers may scale back offers of reward cards because merchants will have the ability to “steer” customers to cards that charge lower fees.“The most likely beneficiaries would be the cheapest networks, which are debit cards that use a four-digit pin,” said Robert Dodd of Morgan Keegan. Visa is the largest operator of such pin networks, followed by Star Network, which is owned by First Data.

Investors were cautious before a week that sees the first major earnings report, out on Thursday from miner Alcoa, and the key non-farm payrolls report, set to be released on Friday.Michael Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners, said that the stock market had recently been moving in the opposite direction to the dollar.“[A falling dollar means] US goods are cheaper overseas so there’s an opportunity for business to pick up and maybe even hire a few more people,” he said.But the dollar, which fell sharply last week, rose on Monday against a basket of other currencies.Investors were briefly cheered by a report on factory orders that showed they fell 0.5 per cent. But factory orders excluding the volatile transportation sector rose 0.9 per cent.A separate release showed pending home sales rose more than expected to a four-month high in August, the latest set of data to suggest that the housing market could be regaining some stability after the withdrawal of the homebuyer tax credit earlier in the year.The materials sector led the fallers, down 1.4 per cent, as metals prices, which have risen recently on hopes of strong demand in China, fell slightly.US Steel declined 2.8 per cent to $42.42, AK Steel lost 2.8 per cent to $13.58 and Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore producer, was down by 3.7 per cent to $64.12.The technology sector fell 1.1 per cent with Microsoft dropped 1.9 per cent to $23.91 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral” and cut its price target for the maker of Windows and Office software.Analysts were concerned that it is taking longer for customers to replace old PCs and that many are turning instead to tablet computers and smartphones, where Windows does not yet have a presence. The technology company raised its dividend in September but Goldman analysts said that it should have increased it more in order to appeal to a larger investor base.Elsewhere in technology, Intel was lower by 2.3 per cent to $18.87 and Apple dropped 1.4 per cent to $278.64.In financials, JPMorgan Chase managed to withstand the sector’s slide, edging up 0.5 per cent to $38.95 after having risen 1.6 per cent earlier in the session.It was reported that the bank could boost its dividend next year and that the share price may rise as much as 45 per cent during the next two years, because of a strong senior management team and acquisitions made during the financial crisis.AIG also rose, climbing 1.1 per cent to $39.28 in spite of lowering its valuation of its Asian business in order to secure a $1bn pledge from the Kuwait Investment Authority and other important investors, according to people familiar with the matter.However the S&P 500 financials index dropped 0.7 per cent. American Express sunk 6.5 per cent to $39.05 after an antitrust lawsuit was filed against the company. Rivals Visa and MasterCard settled with regulators over an investigation about restrictions on merchants. Shares in Visa edged lower by 0.1 per cent to $73.24 and MasterCard fell 1 per cent to $222.64.In deals news, Sanofi-Aventis launched a hostile bid for Genzyme Corp at $69 per share, the same offer it first made at the end of July.US-listed shares in the French drugs company fell 0.8 per cent to $32.87 while Genzyme shares added 0.2 per cent to $71.01.Sara Lee surged 7.2 per cent to $14.40 after it was reported that the consumer-goods company had rejected a $12bn buy-out offer from KKR, the private equity group.

Prime property assets in the UK are seen as the main focus.The deal, which is at a yield of less than 6 per cent, was agreed this week, but needs to be ratified by the consortium’s investment panel.CB Richard Ellis is advising the sellers; Jones Lang LaSalle is advising RREEF. All parties declined to comment.The move will mark the latest involvement of an Asian state pension fund in the UK real estate market, following a succession of deals by South Korean vehicles in particular. These have tended to target well-located properties with long-term tenants that offer stable income, rather than more active asset management opportunities, and have underpinned the sharp recovery in prices for such assets in London for the past year.The fund is said to want to diversify its holdings outside Malaysia and also expand into alternative assets such as real estate. There is a similar strategy in the South Korean state pension vehicle, the National Pension Service of Korea, which has embarked on a buying spree of large UK assets such as the £773m HSBC tower in Canary Wharf and a City of London office building at 88 Wood Street for £183m."
375;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa blocked in China after Unionpay dispute;;Visa has been blocked from starting any new business in China for almost one year, after a disagreement with China Unionpay, the country’s state-backed bank card monopoly, according to people familiar with the matter.The problems facing Visa and other global payment companies prompted the United States Trade Representative to file a case with the World Trade Organization against China on Wednesday.Visa first warned Unionpay almost a year ago to stop processing international transactions for co-branded cards through Unionpay’s own payment system rather than Visa’s, a demand Visa makes of all its partners around the world.But Unionpay, which was set up under the auspices of China’s central bank and is owned by 80 Chinese banks and other state entities, initially refused to comply and issued a scathing rebuttal in June this year when the dispute became public.While Unionpay has continued to gradually expand its co-operation with companies like MasterCard and American Express, it has refused to consider any new business lines with Visa since the payments group asked it to observe the terms of their agreement, according to people in the Chinese bank card industry.Unionpay declined to comment.A Visa spokesperson said: “We have been in China for more than a decade and we have a long history of working with China Unionpay. While we continue to grow our cross-border payments business, like all payment companies we look forward to eventually participating in the domestic payments market.”But Visa has said in the past that China is the only major market in the world where they are excluded from participating in the domestic payment business.In its WTO case, which comes amid rising Sino-US trade tensions, the US government alleges China is breaking commitments it made to trade partners to open its bank card market to international competition by 2006.“The Chinese government is giving China Unionpay a monopoly over most credit and debit card transactions by Chinese consumers,” US Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. “China’s actions unfairly deprive US credit and debit card companies of access to a huge market.”The USTR has been periodically speaking with Visa, MasterCard and other international payment companies for the last four years to understand whether China is meeting its WTO commitments.The year-long virtual ban on new business in China for Visa, the world’s largest payments company, appears to be a major factor in the decision to file a case with the WTO now.But MasterCard, Visa’s arch-rival, seems to have adopted a less confrontational strategy in China.On Wednesday, the same day the USTR announced it had taken its case to the WTO, MasterCard said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Unionpay aimed at “mutually beneficial business development”.MasterCard declined to comment.
376;V;Visa Inc;2010-09-06T20:44:28Z;São Paulo advertising goes underground;Law against billboards forces industry to think creatively;Four years ago, the streets of São Paulo, South America’s biggest city, were strewn with advertising. Messages on the surfaces of buildings, buses, shops, taxis and even private homes competed with billboards to create a chaotic and dizzying corporate assault on the senses.So, Gilberto Kassab, the centre-right mayor of the city with the continent’s biggest consumer market, came up with a radical solution: a blanket ban on outdoor advertising. In late 2006, in spite of legal wrangles and business lobbying, he announced that, almost without exception, outdoor advertising would have to be removed within months.“The Clean City Law came from a necessity to combat pollution . . . pollution of water, sound, air and the visual,” he said. “We decided that we should start combating pollution with the most conspicuous sector – visual pollution.”At the time, advertising and marketing executives feared the ban would be an insurmountable blow, and quietly hoped the law would not be fully enforced. Industry representatives protested that the ban would limit freedom of speech, kill jobs and badly damage their sector.“We all thought it was the end of the world,” says Marcio Oliveira, vice-president of operations at Lew’Lara\TBWA. “We thought, ‘OK, this is gonna screw up all our business.’ ”Three years after the new law came in, it is extremely difficult to find outdoor advertising in the city – no billboards, no ads on buses or taxis or in shop windows. But equally remarkable is how quickly big advertisers and the industry itself have adapted and, in fact, thrived.Today, it is hard to find anyone – including among advertising and marketing professionals – who still has big complaints about the Lei Cidade Limpa, or “Clean City Law”.The city feels cleaner, they say, and the law forced creative innovations into other, newer, advertising methods that have often been more effective. “In the first instance, everybody, including the advertisers, loved this – to see their city without this visual pollution we had in the past,” says Mr Oliveira.“I think it’s a good law,” says Nizan Guanaes, head of Grupo ABC, Brazil’s largest advertising group. “It was a challenge for us because, of course, it’s easier to simply throw garbage advertising all over your city.”Márcio Santoro, co-president of Agência Africa, part of Grupo ABC, says that before the law, “it was really a mess. It was terrible. There came a point that for you to be noticed you had to buy a lot of ads, because there was so much noise.”The law is now so popular that some companies that were able through legal action to maintain some outdoor presence chose not to, so as not to be seen as flying in the face of Cidade Limpa.Advertising creatives and marketing directors were forced quickly to find new ways to spend money that had been earmarked for outdoor advertising, especially since the law came into effect almost immediately. “Usually in Brazil it takes a little time for laws to get set up,” says Marcello Queiroz, an editor at Propaganda and Marketing newspaper in São Paulo. “It was really dramatic how quick things changed. Big companies had to change their focus and strategies.”Marketing directors had to find a place to spend the money they previously put into billboards. The result, they say, was a creative flowering of new and alternative methods – including indoor innovations such as elevator and bathroom ads – but primarily in digital media.“The internet was the really big winner,” says Mr Oliveira. In 2007, there was already a move towards the internet, digital media and social networking marketing worldwide, but the Cidade Limpa law gave Brazilians an extra push, he says.Anna Freitag, marketing manager of Hewlett-Packard Brazil, says a realisation came that outdoor advertising is less effective than these newer strategies. “A billboard is media on the road. In rational purchases it means less effectiveness . . . as people are involved in so many things that it makes it difficult to execute the call to action,” she says.“HP decided to go deeper and understand consumer behaviour – the path to purchase, and place media in this direction . . . The internet and social media are the big trends associated with point of sale presence.”It also helped that Brazilians were extremely active in social media. The country has one of the highest percentages of active Twitter users in the world and Brazilians are avid social networkers.Lalai Luna, co-founder of Remix, a new agency specialising in digital and social media strategies, often focusing on music culture, says this opened up opportunities and cash flow for young creatives with experimental models to develop their craft.“Companies had to find their own ways to promote products and brands on the streets,” she says. “São Paulo started having a lot more guerilla marketing [unconventional strategies, such as public stunts and viral campaigns] and it gave a lot of power to online and social media campaigns as a new way to interact with people.”“The internet is the next frontier for reasons I don’t have to explain,” says Mr Guanaes. “Brazil is very sophisticated in digital and social media. That’s why we have a digital agency in the US [San Francisco’s Pereira & O’Dell] and it just won the Advertising Age award for best small agency in the US.”The Clean City Law has thrown up winners as well as losers. The businesses and workers that dealt directly with in­stalling and removing billboards have not benefited from the boom in digital marketing, but the move has certainly not stopped Brazilian agencies from being the focus of much international attention.Publicis, the world’s third largest advertising group, is in the advanced stages of negotiation to buy Talent, a São Paulo agency, for a high price that underlines how highly international companies value getting a foothold in the Brazilian market.And some international brands are choosing Brazil as a global hub for campaigns. Mr Oliveira says Lew’Lara\TBWA is creating Visa’s global campaign for its sponsorship of Fifa events in Brazil, including the World Cup, which will be exported abroad.The plan was probably never to maintain a complete ban on all outdoor advertising for ever. The expectation was that the law would sweep the city clean and later allow for some outdoor advertising in a small number of controlled locations.But, three years after the implementation of Lei Cidade Limpa, few are clamouring for a return to those cluttered days.

Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, beat expectations and swung into profit for the first time in three years. Its shares rose 5.8 per cent to $17.13.Credit card companies rose after VeriFone Systems, the provider of electronic payment technology, raised its full-year forecast. Verifone jumped 8.5 per cent to $24.32. MasterCard was up 1.8 per cent to $206.11. Visa climbed 0.3 per cent to $70.86.Also among the risers, Google pushed up 0.7 per cent to $454.62 after it said it was launching a voice call service, which could rival Skype.Apple fell 0.4 per cent to $17.12 after it was reported that it was close to agreeing deals to offer TV shows for 99 cents and a separate report suggested it may update the Ipod.But earlier in the day all sectors suffered after orders for durable goods fell short of economists’ estimates, increasing 0.3 per cent in July compared with the average forecast of a 3 per cent rise.Excluding transportation, orders fell 3.8 per cent, the biggest drop since January 2009. The indicator pointed to a slowdown in manufacturing and added to fears about the pace of the economic recovery, which sent the S&P 500 down to seven-week lows on Tuesday.New-home sales, meanwhile, unexpectedly fell 12.4 per cent to an annualised figure of 276,000 in July compared with economists’ estimates of 330,000.The figure for June was revised down to 315,000.But investors, who were disappointed by existing home-sales data on Tuesday, had already pencilled in a weak figure.Mounting signs of a slowdown in the economic recovery has prompted some analysts to expect further quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve.“Our expectation would be that the Fed will likely add chapters to QE2 [quantitative easing, round two],” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities. “I don’t think it’s a sole requirement but it’s part and parcel of what the market needs to see it regain its earlier confidence.”He added that he would like to see tax incentives and training programmes to encourage business leaders to start hiring.But the S&P 500 energy index suffered, falling 0.3 per cent, as coal miners fell on the back of concerns that the declining price of natural gas may prompt power stations to switch from coal to natural gas. Arch Coal lost 1.9 per cent to $21.99 and US-listed shares of MacArthur Coal dropped 7.5 per cent to $20.03.In deal news, both 3Par and PotashCorp, targets of recent bids, fell. 3Par said it would start talks with Hewlett-Packard, which bid $1.6bn for the data storage company. 3Par lost 1 per cent to $26.76, Hewlett-Packard was down 0.4 per cent to $38.24 and Dell, which had entered a lower bid for the company and was reported to be considering beating HP’s offer, nudged up 1.7 per cent to $11.79.US-listed shares in PotashCorp fell 2.4 per cent to $145.50 after Marius Kloppers, chief executive of bidder BHP Billiton, said there was only a “small universe” of interest in the fertiliser producer. US-listed shares in BHP Billiton, which also reported pre-tax profits that surged nearly 70 per cent, nudged up 0.1 per cent to $65.51.In contrast, Genzyme rose 0.3 per cent to $67.58 after French pharmaceuticals group Sanofi-Aventis, which has offered up to $70 a share for the maker of drugs for genetic conditions, said that it would not raise its bid beyond $70. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis added 0.3 per cent to $28.38.

Learning the Dutch for toothpaste and the Polish for shower gel has long been an educational side-effect of shopping at Poundland, which secured cheap goods wherever it could find them on global markets and brought them here.But as the Warburg Pincus-owned chain has grown, it no longer goes through the backdoor to strike deals with foreign outposts of large, fast-moving consumer goods companies.Instead, it can extract the same keen prices from the UK branches.Poundland’s constant scouring of the global marketplace for any arbitrage opportunities on name-brand shampoo or air freshener is a small part of the wider trend toward price deflation in developed markets that consumer goods groups have been complaining about.Unilever this month acknowledged it needed to trim prices to stay competitive, while Procter & Gamble made similar comments. PZ Cussons said last month that basic personal care products would remain at £1 – that magic figure for UK discounters – for ‘quite a time’.This trend of UK price deflation means consumer goods groups must accelerate their international expansion into emerging markets. It may also take some of the fun out of shopping at Poundland, but its expansion plans should not suffer.Tiger Tiger burning outIt is easy to become lost in the jungle, especially when hunting a well-camouflaged beast. RSA has been accused of losing sight of its prey this week after some confusion over the real profitability of Aviva’s general insurance businesses, which RSA bid £5bn for late last month.The company, codenamed “tiger” in the approach to Aviva’s “lion”, apparently underestimated the profit contribution of RAC, which RSA does not want to buy. Tiger is after only the main commercial, motor and home insurance businesses of the UK, Ireland and Canada.Aviva does not disclose much about its “leopard”, the code name for RAC. With one analyst putting the leopard’s profits as high as £150m on Tuesday, analysts have mostly now reached a number that is closer to £50m post-tax, for last year.There are some clues at Companies House. RAC plc, the holding company that has the chunky pension deficits and inter-company loans, and its subsidiary RAC Motoring Services, both still file accounts there. RAC plc made £6m post-tax last year after a loss of £101m the year before. Motor Services made £51m post-tax last year and £52m the year before.Some analysts are still unsure about how this income is booked by Aviva: whether it is all in the lion’s general insurance profits, or whether some of it is still split into the “other” line as it was historically. One may assume all the roadside profits are in GI, while another assumes a 50-50 split.The extent of the impact on RSA’s £5bn valuation of the businesses it wants to buy is ultimately a bit of a sideshow. Mostly, the mysterious leopard has given advisers to the two sides an excuse to point out failings at each other, while the big cats simply sit and glower.But the tiger sits in the Asian jungle and the lion on the African plains and it looks increasingly likely that they will remain on different continents. Forget the leopard, the real obstacle here is Aviva’s financing structure and pension deficit. This gearing makes it difficult to see the value to Aviva shareholders in selling the lion at a price it would make sense for the tiger to pay. The risk is that this episode will not reflect well on either company.Payments palsDataCash shareholders have struck gold with MasterCard’s £333m takeover. The 54 per cent premium being paid by the US giant to become the UK tech company’s best buddy seems so last century. The Aim-listed payments company has worked hard to stay abreast of the online game, but its investors seem to be benefiting mainly from MasterCard’s tardiness.Visa, the card company’s great rival, has already shelled out $2bn (£1.3bn) this year for its own e-commerce company. But it paid a lower premium for a business with four-and-a-half times the profits and more than 10 times the transaction volumes, according to US analysts.But both groups are lagging behind PayPal, the best-known name in online payments. Ebay thinks PayPal could overtake the online auctions unit to become its biggest single business by next year. On top of this it is trying to get PayPal into mobile telephone software – the next gold-mine.

379;V;Visa Inc;2010-08-19T18:17:17Z;MasterCard in software fightback;;MasterCard, the world’s second-largest payments network, on Thursday signalled its intent to fight back in the rapidly changing industry after agreeing to buy DataCash, a UK payment service provider.The US company will pay 360p per share in cash, representing a 53 per cent premium to DataCash’s closing price on Wednesday of 234p, valuing the company at £333m ($520m).MasterCard has admitted it needs to compete more effectively in the payment and transfer of consumer cash around the world against nimbler, more web-focused rivals such as PayPal, owned by Ebay.Traditional MasterCard competitors, including American Express and Visa, have committed to competing in the online payment market.Ajay Banga, MasterCard chief executive, recently set up a division dedicated to bringing products to market faster.DataCash, listed on London’s junior Aim market since 1996, sells a single software interface that allows organisations to process secure payments online and offline anywhere in the world. DataCash shares soared 52 per cent to 355p on Thursday.“The acquisition of DataCash will expand our already significant e-commerce merchant gateway presence in Asia and Australia to European countries and other high-growth, emerging markets worldwide,” said Mr Banga.The deal will be implemented by a scheme of arrangement.DataCash’s directors, who collectively owned a 44 per cent stake in the company, have backed the offer.The deal is likely to provide a windfall of more than £140m for Ashley Head, DataCash executive chairman, who has a 43.2 per cent stake.Gavin Breeze, one of the co-founders who stepped down from the DataCash board in March 2008, has also committed his 8.4 per cent stake.MasterCard said it expected the deal to dilute fourth-quarter earnings by about 5 cents per share because of amortisation and other one-off costs.For the year to December 31, DataCash has reported a rise in pre-tax profits from £5.5m to £8.1m, while turnover rose 32 per cent to £36.9m.DataCash was advised by UBS while Deutsche Bank advised MasterCard.

383;V;Visa Inc;2010-07-28T19:07:02Z;P&G in 10-year deal with Olympics;;Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Olay facecream will be among the global brands backing the 2012 London Olympics, under a new deal between the International Olympic Committee and Procter & Gamble.P&G, the world’s largest consumer products company, said on Wednesday it had signed a 10-year sponsorship agreement with the IOC that will cover the next three summer games and two winter Olympics, joining established IOC sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s.The deal, which gives P&G the right to use the Olympic rings logo globally, is the first with the IOC that covers multiple brands under one sponsor, and follows P&G’s sponsorship of the US national team at the Vancouver 2010 winter games.In addition to intense television advertising during broadcasts of the games in the US, the company set up a “family home” in Vancouver that offered athletes a free overnight laundry service, baby-changing facilities and supplies of its Pringles branded snacks.Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said that the Vancouver marketing effort resulted in almost $100m in incremental sales in the US and six billion consumer marketing impressions.He also said that the effort increased the effectiveness of its brands’ advertising with consumers by 30-37 per cent.“We used Vancouver as a pilot programme, and then from there …decided to go ahead and scale it up,” he said.Mr Pritchard declined to give details of the costs, but said that the scale of the Olympic marketing efforts made the investment “a very efficient spend”.Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, said in London that P&G’s global reach – with more than 40 per cent of its $79bn annual sales last year coming from the developing world – would support increased awareness of the Olympic movement.P&G has set itself a target of reaching more than 5bn consumers around the world over the next five years, from 4bn currently, with most of the growth expected to come from developing markets.Mr Pritchard noted that the 2014 winter games were taking place in Russia and that the 2016 summer games in Brazil, both important markets for P&G. “We definitely intend to use this to build our developing markets,” he said.P&G’s efforts under the new deal will include producing videos ahead of the 2012 London Games featuring the mothers of six famous Olympic athletes including Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprinter, Paula Radcliffe, the British runner, and Michael Phelps, the US swimmer.This month Dow Chemical also said it had signed a similar deal with the IOC.

385;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
386;V;Visa Inc;2010-07-14T22:23:26Z;JPMorgan names new joint leaders of US investment unit;;JPMorgan completed a reshuffle of its top ranks yesterday, naming two rising stars to co-head its investment bank in the US and Canada and charging them with pressing home the advantage gained during the financial crisis.Jeff Urwin, a former Bear Stearns banker who led client coverage, and Kevin Willsey, the head of equity capital markets, will succeed Doug Braunstein, who was promoted to group finance chief last month.The appointments round off an overhaul of JPMorgan’s investment bank which began late last year when Jamie Dimon, chief executive, dismissed Bill Winters, the highly respected co-head of the global securities business.The choice of two internal candidates underlines the success of JPMorgan’s investment bank, which took advantage of rivals’ weaknesses and financial troubles to win more clients and bigger deals in 2008 and 2009. Last year the investment banking unit, which had not traditionally been one of the biggest Wall Street players, came out on top of many industry league tables and recorded a global profit of $6.9bn – more than half of JPMorgan’s total.Although the profits were powered by a trading boom, advisory and capital market fees also rose strongly, especially in the US.As competitors such as Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and UBS collapsed or faltered during the crisis, JPMorgan exploited its better financial health and large balance sheet to win important takeover and capital raising mandates.In 2008 and 2009, JPMorgan was among the underwriters for large financings by US companies, including a $12.2bn equity offering by General Electric and a $19.7bn listing by Visa.Jes Staley, the global investment banking chief, yesterday credited Mr Urwin, a 54-year-old British-born banker who joined JPMorgan after its cut-price takeover of Bear in 2008, and Mr Willsey, 47, a hard-charging banker with a reputation as a no-nonsense operator, with much of that success.Mr Staley’s memo also contained an unusual expression of thanks for Jimmy Lee, JPMorgan’s veteran deal-maker, whose position as vice-chairman of the investment bank remains unchanged after yesterday’s announcement.The promotions position Mr Willsey as a potential successor to Mr Staley and consolidates the status of Mr Urwin, whose appointment after the Bear takeover had surprised some JPMorgan bankers.Wall Street banks have had a mixed record when splitting senior jobs among two executives, partly because of personality clashes and a proliferation of bureaucracy.But JPMorgan executives said Mr Urwin and Mr Willsey would split responsibilities, with Mr Urwin focusing on organising the team and managing its resources and Mr Willsey working on clients and deals.

388;V;Visa Inc;2010-07-03T00:55:44Z;Edenred looks to conquer voucher market;;"Jacques Stern lays out a walletful of plastic payment cards on the marble-top table in his office in a Parisian suburb.The cards are not an ostentatious display of new-found wealth for France’s newest chairman and chief executive. Instead they are examples of the range of payment products which Mr Stern hopes will drive growth at Edenred, which made its stock market debut on Friday.Edenred is the newly baptised Accor Services, the vouchers business of the Accor hotels and services group, which became the country’s biggest listing in two years on Friday.Edenred issues vouchers, such as lunch tickets, to corporate clients that benefit from government tax breaks when they give them as perks to employees.The new company’s closest competitors are Sodexo and Compass, the catering services groups, and Mastercard and Visa in payments services.The Accor hotels and services businesses are forging independent paths after the decision last year by Gilles Pélisson, executive chairman, to split Accor, backed by the group’s private equity shareholders, Colony Capital and Eurazeo, which hold 30 per cent of the shares.Accor investors received one share in the hotel company and one share in Edenred on Friday. Edenred shares opened at €13 and rose 23 per cent to close at €14.80, giving it a market value of €3.34bn ($4.2bn). The price put Edenred on a price-earnings ratio of about 14 times estimated 2011 earnings, in line with Visa.“I …think the split will boost value because there is a real industrial project,” said Mr Stern in an interview with the Financial Times. “We will demonstrate that it is more than a financial transaction.”Mr Stern’s annual growth target of 6 to 14 per cent of issue volume – a function of the number of cards and their face value – is dependent on entering new countries, expanding existing products and introducing new ones.Just under 90 per cent of the business is based around a tax framework but is this a good time to be approaching cash-strapped governments for tax breaks?Mr Stern has studies to show that the initial tax break is more than recovered by increased payroll and value added tax.“Typically 50 to 70 per cent of people who benefit from a meal voucher will not go to a restaurant if they did not have the voucher. So you are creating extra business and extra employment, which generate taxes.”He quotes two initiatives: an ecocheque developed last year in Belgium – an employee voucher to buy green products; and in Brazil, the company’s biggest market followed by Italy, it is negotiating a culture voucher.His aim is to reduce the dominance of the meal and luncheon vouchers – from 80 per cent of the business to 50 per cent – with these and other products, and to switch from paper vouchers to cards. The two most promising products are childcare vouchers, which have been “very,very popular” in the UK, with annual growth rates of 20 per cent. He also sees great potential in an expense management card, which has been growing at 15 per cent a year in South America.A gift voucher, aimed at incentivising sales forces, has been less successful. Last year, the company wrote down the value of Kadéos, its gift voucher business, tipping it into a pro-forma net loss of €50m, compared with a net profit of €177m in 2008.This year will be profitable, he says, but he regards it as “transitional” because of the demerger and weak European economy but there will be faster growth next year.And with that, he packs up his cards to leave."
389;V;Visa Inc;2010-07-01T18:04:22Z;Sponsors get a kick out of the World Cup;;A new Coca-Cola sign hangs from the roof of Joe’s Butchery and restaurant in the poor black township of Alexandra, a few miles from the centre of Johannesburg. Inside, afternoon drinkers eat grilled beef and sausages and watch Paraguay take on Japan on a giant screen framed in the soft drinkmaker’s colours.“We are a Coke house,” jokes William Mathebula, a music promoter who runs the restaurant with his niece, Laly.As well as supplying the flat screen television, Coca-Cola has provided myriad decorations. All are branded in its colours, part of a World Cup-related initiative to extend sales of soft drinks in low-income areas. In total, 1,000 South African places like Joe’s Butchery have been kitted out as sites to allow customers to view World Cup games.And the scheme seems to be working, if sales at Joe’s Butchery are any guide. “Three years ago we used to sell three cases a week,” says Ms Mathebula. “Recently it has been up to 35 cases.”Coca Cola’s efforts in areas such as Alexandra are part of a much broader marketing drive linked to the World Cup. At its heart is a big sponsorship deal signed with FIFA.The soft drinks company is one of FIFA’s six “partners”, which have paid on average more than $100m (€88m, £73m) to sponsor the tournament.Each of the six (Visa, the payments company, Emirates, the airline, Hyundai, the Korean group that makes Kia cars, Adidas, the European sportswear company, and Sony, the electronics company, are the others) receive about nine minutes of advertising time per match. Eight other international sponsors pay about half that, receiving in exchange 4½ minutes per game, while eight so-called national supporters pay less for less coverage.Overall, the tournament, Africa’s first World Cup, attracted nearly $1bn in sponsorship.“This is of huge interest to a lot of brands,” says Nigel Currie, of the Brand Rapport sponsorship consultancy in London. “The consumer market in Africa is so big and so untapped. And these brands are all desperate to get a foothold.”The companies, unsurprisingly, insist that their outlays are cost-effective.Visa says spending by international visitors to South Africa on Visa branded payment cards was 65 per cent higher in the first 3½ weeks of June, compared with the same period of 2009. Over the same period visitor numbers rose about a fifth. Sponsors’ benefits have extended beyond South Africa, because of the billions watching on television.“It is clearly not just about the host market,” says Michael Lynch, head of global sponsorship management at Visa. “The television audiences for every single match but one has exceeded those of the last World Cup in Germany …we are seeing significant positive results.” Independent research appears to corroborate the sponsors’ view.Adidas has won back marketing ground from Nike, one of its main rivals since the World Cup began three weeks ago.NM Incite – a joint venture between Nielsen, the consumer research group, and McKinsey, the consultancy – found that its share of internet blogging and tweeting about the competition – so-called “buzz” – has risen, while Nike’s has fallen. Hyundai Kia, the Korean carmaker and another Fifa partner, has seen similar benefits.Emirates insisted this week that its sponsorship deal with Fifa had been “worth every cent”, allowing it to reach 2bn people. “To get the same kind of exposure online that we get from the World Cup sponsorship, for example, would cost about $3bn,” a company spokesman this week told Business Day, a Johannesburg daily.Not all the sponsors are as active in the local market as Coca Cola but back at Joe’s Butchery there is plenty of support for the idea that they should be.“Guys come here with their credit cards and their girlfriends,” says Mr Mathebula, who says living standards have improved radically in Alexandra in recent years. “The companies that don’t tap into this market are missing out.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in London
390;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Retail banks feel pinch of tougher oversight;;Whether wrangling with a new consumer protection agency or being held to stricter underwriting standards for home loans, retail banks are preparing for broad changes because of the financial reform bill.“To the extent a bank is in the retail consumer business, it gets clobbered the most under this legislation,” said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice-president of financial institutions policies at the American Bankers Association.Mr Abernathy said banks would now be at the mercy of a consumer tsar, appointed by the president and Congress, to run the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Agency.Housed within the Federal Reserve, but independently funded, the agency will have broad powers to regulate all kinds of consumer financial products, from credit cards to home loans.Mr Abernathy called the creation of the agency, “the single most damaging provision in the legislation for retail banks”.Another change involves “ interchange” fees paid by merchants to card issuers. Under the new rules, such fees would be capped by the Federal Reserve at a “reasonable” level.In an important change to the provision, the Fed will be prevented from regulating network fees charged by Visa and MasterCard, leaving the card-issuing banks to bear the brunt of the new fee caps.Frustration over the legislation devolved last week into a rare bit of finger pointing, with David Nelms, the chief executive of Discover Financial Services, blaming price hikes by its rival Visa for setting the stage for more restrictive oversight.“Visa raised prices quite a bit and, I think, took the actions that have led to the legislation in the first place,” Mr Nelms told a reporter. Visa declined to comment.It is not known yet what the final cost to retail banks will be of these new rules, in part because some of them will not be issued for months.Some analysts say that community banks could be pushed into the arms of larger players, which are better equipped to handle the additional oversight.What does seem certain is that banks will look to offset these costs by raising prices elsewhere. Banks have already moved to eliminate free checking and other services in response to restrictions on credit card and overdraft fees enacted earlier this year.The question is whether that cat-and-mouse game will continue under the new regulatory framework.Consumer groups said the legislation was a broad win for Main Street. “Finally consumers have a shot at being part of the market place, instead of trying to stay one step ahead of the latest scam,” said Susan Weinstock, the Consumer Federation of America’s financial reform director.The new consumer watchdog will have help in policing retail banks under new rules that allow state attorneys-general to impose tougher restrictions.National banks will no longer be able to use federal standards to pre-empt local law. State attorneys-general have tended to be quicker than federal regulators to crack down on predatory lending practices.
391;V;Visa Inc;2010-06-25T20:43:24Z;US banks rally after reform agreement;;US stocks rallied on Friday as lawmakers completed negotiations on financial regulation legislation, removing some of the uncertainty around reform.But a report showing first-quarter economic growth had been slower than estimated damped risk appetite. The main indices were all lower on the week, after two weeks of positive returns.“Investors are starting to take down their growth rate expectations for the next two to four quarters,” said Doug Cliggott, US equity strategist at Credit Suisse.“However, there are two positives for the market: valuations are pretty good and the balance sheets of the large caps are in great shape.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent to 1,076.59 but 3.5 per cent lower on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.1 per cent to 10,143.81 and fell 2.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher to 2,223.48 but had erased 3.5 per cent since the start of the week.The measures agreed in Congress overnight on Thursday will regulate banks’ capacity to trade in derivatives but will not force them to sell their derivatives businesses, a measure some lawmakers had been pushing for.“While some of the measures may be stricter than some [observers] may have predicted, at least now the industry and markets can move from wondering what the reforms may be to learning how to live with them and move on,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.Financials, the session’s best performing sector, were higher across the board on Friday. JPMorgan rose 3.7 per cent to $39.44, Citigroup rallied 4.2 per cent to $3.94, Morgan Stanley added 3.1 per cent to $25.01, Bank of America advanced 2.7 per cent to $15.42 and Goldman Sachs jumped 3.5 per cent to $139.66.However, credit card companies underperformed the main indices as the financial reform bill limited the fee levels they can charge customers.MasterCard dropped 0.7 per cent to $213.30,Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent to $42.68 but Visa rose 0.2 per cent to $76.61.Oracle, the world’s second-largest software company, rallied 2 per cent to $22.66 on Friday. It reported a fourth-quarter profit of60 cents per share after the market closed on Thursday, topping the average analyst estimate of 54 cents per share. Demand for its programmes has grown as the economy recovers from the recession and it has been able to renew support contracts.Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry smartphone, dropped 10.8 per cent on Friday to $52.23 after posting worse-than-expected first-quarter revenues after the market closed on Thursday. Revenues in the quarter were $4.24bn, against the $4.35bn average analyst estimate, as competition between the BlackBerry and Apple’s iPhone intensified.KB Home was down 9 per cent to $11.12 on Friday, as the homebuilder specialising in homes for first-time buyers reported a second-quarter loss of 40 cents per share. Analysts had on average estimated a loss of 31 cents per share.Homebuilders were among the week’s worst performers following data released on Wednesday showing new home sales had fallen to the lowest level since records began in 1963.Pulte Group was 4.6 per cent lower at $8.92 and Toll Brothers declined 4.1 per cent to $17.20 but Beazer Homes inched up 1.7 per cent to $4.12.Lennar Corp was up 0.8 per cent to $14.68 after reporting slightly better than expected second-quarter results on Thursday.US-listed shares in BP were 15 per cent lower to $27.02 on the week as oil continued to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. On Wednesday, New York’s state pension fund said it planned to sue the oil company to recover losses due to the fall in BP’s share price. The fund said it owned more than 19m shares in BP when the oil spill begun in April.Anadarko Petroleum, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the damaged oil well, fell 11.9 per cent to $37.68 over the week.
392;V;Visa Inc;2010-06-22T16:08:35Z;Beijing gives an unexpected lesson in regulatory risk;;Investors in China have just been given another lesson in what regulatory risk means.On Monday, the People’s Bank of China sent a sigh of relief through the internet industry as a set of long-awaited rules regulating third-party payment services did not, as many had feared, seem to exclude incumbents such as Alibaba from the industry. They can apply for licences and then keep doing what they’ve been doing for years, the rules say.But wait a minute. After taking a closer look overnight, internet companies have realised that anyone who has foreigners among its shareholders will be locked out of the relatively simple licensing process and instead be subject to potentially onerous, opaque procedures at the cabinet level with an uncertain outcome.That applies to every company listed outside the mainland’s markets – virtually all significant Chinese internet companies.Thus, the central bank’s eagerness to protect domestic banks against competition from foreign payment providers such as Visa is ironically dealing a blow to one of China’s very own rising industries.Some Chinese players have a back door that protects them against such risks. China Mobile – the world’s largest mobile operator which just acquired a stake in a domestic bank to help push its aspirations in the mobile payment business – is listed in Hong Kong, but it has an unlisted fully state-owned parent under which it can easily put the payment business.A French whodunnitThey could all be characters in one of Agatha Christie’s finest mysteries. There is the aged and extremely wealthy heiress, the dashing photographer who has become her favourite, her estranged daughter, the butler who spies on his employer, the loyal financial adviser who manages her billions around the world and a Swiss multinational hovering in the background.Throw in a leading politician engaged in transforming his country’s finances and his wife with her own career working for the heiress’s family office. This all makes a pretty colourful and explosive cocktail. No, it is not The Mysterious Affair at Styles, set in a grand mansion in an idyllic English village. It is a real-life whodunnit that is now gripping the entire French establishment.At the heart of the matter is a battle over the multibillion-euro fortune of Liliane Bettencourt, France’s richest woman, who together with Nestlé is the controlling shareholder in the world’s leading shampoo group, L’Oréal. Her daughter Françoise Meyers-Bettencourt has launched legal action to claw back the money and gifts – including an island in the Indian Ocean – that her mother has over the years doled out to the photographer François-Marie Banier. In order to win her case coming to court next month, the daughter must prove her mother’s mental fragility.That is bad enough. But now tapes leaked in the course of the legal battle have raised questions over the role of one of Mrs Bettencourt’s financial advisers, Florence Woerth. For Mrs Woerth is none other than the wife of Eric Woerth, the former French budget minister and now labour minister in charge of the delicate reform of the country’s pension system.The tapes, which were recorded by the butler, feature an alleged conversation between the heiress and her chief financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre, also the boss of Mrs Woerth, over the allocation of Mrs Bettencourt’s offshore assets.The leaking of the tapes has intensified the political brouhaha over the affair and the heiress is now trying to put a stop to all the fuss. This week she said she would collaborate with the tax authorities and repatriate her offshore assets. Nonetheless, what continues to raise eyebrows in France is the fact that Mrs Woerth was involved in managing Mrs Bettencourt’s fortune when her husband, then budget minister, was spearheading his country’s campaign to clamp down on tax havens.Mrs Woerth vigorously denies any wrongdoing and insists she was simply an employee of Mrs Bettencourt’s family office. Her task, she adds, was to reinvest the dividends of Mrs Bettencourt’s holding in L’Oréal. Mr Woerth too has been equally vigorous in denying any wrongdoing and has also noted that the Bettencourt row erupted conveniently on the very day he unveiled his controversial pension reforms. Mrs Woerth will be leaving her job next month, putting an end to any further political controversy.In the end, there are a few basic rules of common sense. If you are a leading political figure you and your family cannot behave like ordinary citizens. When Mr Woerth was offered the job of budget minister, he and his wife should have reflected on the consequences for their careers and come to an arrangement on who should make the sacrifice.world.view@ft.com
393;V;Visa Inc;2010-06-22T00:02:41Z;Financial reform deal to cut debit card fees;;"Debit card fees charged to retailers could be cut under a deal on financial reform hatched by congressional negotiators that hits banks but protects Visa and
MasterCard.A conference committee of lawmakers will on Tuesday resume its public negotiations over the final shape of the landmark legislation, which is due to be delivered to Barack Obama, US president, as soon as the end of the week to be signed into law.The “interchange” fees paid by merchants to card issuers would be capped by the Federal Reserve at a “reasonable” level under a provision put forward by Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois.Mr Durbin said on Monday that conferees from the House of Representatives had agreed to accept his measure, which has already been approved by the Senate, with “minor, clarifying changes”.But, in an important change to the provision, the Fed would be prevented from regulating network fees, which are charged by Visa and MasterCard; they totalled $19.7bn in 2009, or about a third of all interchange fees, according to the Nilson Report.Shares in Visa rose 5 per cent to $80.90 and MasterCard rose 4.2 per cent to $223.34. Both companies saw their shares fall sharply when the earlier version of legislation – that covered the network fees – was passed by the Senate.However, banks faced an almost complete defeat. Although they would be able to charge interchange fees to cover fraud-prevention costs, most other such surcharges would be capped. In deciding what fees would be reasonable, Congress instructed the Fed to consider cheques, which are cleared without any transaction fees.The smallest banks, with assets of less than $10bn, would be exempt from the new rules, as would local, state and federal government programmes that allow people to access benefits with debit cards.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, which, according to Nilson issued a combined $550bn in debit cards last year, stand to suffer most from the new rules.Banks, with the support of a large number of members of Congress, lobbied hard against the legislation, arguing that a similar law passed in Australia in 2003 resulted in higher card fees and fewer benefits, rather than lower costs, to consumers.In spite of the deal being agreed in principle it will still need to be agreed at a public session of conferees. The final legislative package also faces votes in the House and Senate.Interchange is one of the last live battles over financial reform and one of several issues that emerged late in the process and are set to be included in the final legislation in spite of objections from banks.This week the conferees are set to toughen the “Volcker Rule”, which bans banks from proprietary trading and places restrictions on their ownership of hedge funds, and include a provision to force banks into an expensive restructuring of their swaps desks."
394;V;Visa Inc;2010-06-03T17:18:59Z;Visa in clash over China payments;;Visa has told banks they must stop using the payment system of Chinese state-backed China UnionPay to process international transactions for co-branded Visa and UnionPay credit cards.The move comes as credit card companies are becoming increasingly frustrated in China, where transactions must be conducted through the monopoly UnionPay, which is aggressively expanding beyond China’s borders.Visa has written to banks to remind them of operating regulations that require financial institutions to process international transactions outside China through Visa’s system.If banks did not comply with Visa’s request, the card company said it would start to charge penalties from August 1.Visa’s move to block UnionPay outside China comes after US trade officials held talks in late March with Visa, American Express and MasterCard over the possibility of taking action against China for shutting them out of its growing payment processing market.China does not allow foreign groups to issue their own credit cards, build networks to support such cards or process interbank point-of-sale transactions. Companies such as Visa are required to “co-brand” with Chinese partners to provide any of these services.China’s banks generally charge fewer and lower fees than international competitors, and Un-ionPay has been offering cardholders better exchange rates on certain currencies than Visa and its peers normally charge.Although Visa said its actions were not aimed at limiting UnionPay’s international expansion, the China group responded with a scathing statement.“Both companies have a responsibility and obligation to provide overseas transaction services to co-branded card holders,” UnionPay said. “Neither side has the right to unilaterally restrict cardholders’ options for overseas payment channels.”Some US lawyers, trade officials and finance executives say China is violating commitments it made on joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 to open the market to foreign companies for “all payment and money transmission services, including credit, charge and debit cards” by the end of 2006.UnionPay was established by China’s central bank in 2002 and is owned by more than 80 Chinese state-controlled banks.While US card groups complain they are blocked from doing business in China, UnionPay-branded cards can be used in more than 90 countries and regions and the company is strongly promoting its cards abroad.China issued around 50m credit cards in 2008, according to McKinsey. It forecasts that by 2013 the number of credit cards in China will surpass 300m.

Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, lost 4.5 per cent to $58.67.General Electric’s shares lost 5.8 per cent to $16.26. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries filed a US antitrust lawsuit against GE over patents related to wind turbines.Leading banks also slipped. The US Senate, in a party-line vote, sent the financial reform package to a final vote. Citigroup was down 4.7 per cent to $3.63 and Bank of America lost 6.3 per cent to $15.28.Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at UBS, said investors would be watching banking shares as credit risk indicators to determine whether conditions had bottomed out.“Markets have become increasingly concerned about the sufficiency of measures taken to defend the euro as well as the impact of proposed austerity plans,” said Mr Golub.Harman International, an audio equipment maker that receives nearly three-quarters of its revenues in Europe, slipped another 3.7 per cent to $30.56.Net income for Autodesk, the design software maker, jumped 11 per cent in its first quarter over the same period last year, beating analyst expectations.But the group, which said it sold more software overseas, also warned those gains could be fleeting. Shares fell back 6.9 per cent to $28.28.“[Our] enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy,” said Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive.VeriSign, an internet software provider, lost 1.5 per cent to $27.56 after agreeing to sell its security unit to Symantec for $1.3bn. Symantec fell back 5.6 per cent to $14.76.Advance Auto Parts shares were 6.9 per cent higher at $48.99 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $55, citing an economic backdrop in which more drivers would be servicing their own cars, as well as the group’s ability to provide “customer service focus, direct sourcing and price optimisation”.Sears said its earnings fell 39 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year, which the retailer attributed to declining margins in appliances and other big-ticket items. Its shares plummeted 11 per cent to $88.70.Drugstore chain Walgreens lost 6 per cent to $32.71, after analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded it from “outperform” to “neutral”.Ross Stores was 1.1 per cent higher, to $52.28, after it reported higher-than-
expected profits and record sales margins.MasterCard, the payment network, was also among the few gainers. It advanced
1.5 per cent to $205.50 after said Heartland Payment Systems would pay it $41.4m in claims related to security breaches. Visa, however, was 0.2 per cent lower at $72.82."

The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,298.37.Shares with significant European exposure were hit hard. Harman International, a maker of audio equipment, receives more than two-thirds of its revenues from Europe. Harman led S&P 500 decliners, falling 7.7 per cent to $31.73.Also weighing on sentiment was a weaker-than-expected consumer price index April report. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was just 0.9 per cent higher than this time last year – the smallest annual rise since 1966 – indicating a very mild uptick in economic activity.Industrial companies broadly declined. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, led the Dow decliners, losing 2.8 per cent to $61.44. Aerospace group Boeing fell 2.2 per cent to $66.21 and 3M, the diversified industrial, lost 1.1 per cent to $82.54.“Fundamentally, things are not changing yet but, since the market went up prior to the fundamentals improving, the market can also begin to discount a slight pullback prior to actually getting the data,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet, an agency brokerage.Losses were pared later in the afternoon once the S&P 500 neared 1,100, its 200-day moving average, but bounced higher soon after hitting it. “When sentiment is deteriorating, technical levels have outsized significance,” said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies.Support also came from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting notes, in which policy makers raised their 2010 growth forecast and reiterated their dovish stance.Quarterly net income at Deere & Co, manufacturer of agricultural equipment, jumped from $472m to $547m year on year. Shares reversed and were up 3 per cent to $58.87.Financial stocks took a breather amid encouraging signs on regulatory reform. They were the only S&P 500 economic sector to rise, adding 0.2 per cent.Opponents were fighting an effort to bring the bill to an up-or-down vote, and a push to include a provision authorising states to regulate credit-card interest rates looked to have failed.Visa added 4.1 per cent to $72.97, and MasterCard was flat at $202.45. Shares are still down 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, since an amendment to regulate debit card fees was added to the bill on Friday.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at UBS, reiterated his “buy” ratings on Visa and MasterCard, saying markets were pricing in “unrealistic bear case regulatory scenarios”.Capital One Financial, the consumer credit card lender, added 2 per cent to $42.38. American Express added 0.8 per cent to $40.17.Leading banks were stronger, in spite of pressure from Germany’s decision to limit naked short selling, which led to a drop in shares of European banks. Citigroup added 2.1 per cent to $3.81 and Bank of America led Dow risers, up 2.3 per cent to $16.31.Peabody, the biggest US coal producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $38.49, and rival Massey lost 4.2 per cent to $31.35 as natural gas prices rose closer to $4.30 per million British thermal units.Target, the big-box retailer, reported that net income rose 30 per cent from the first quarter a year ago thanks to stronger apparel sales. European sales worries, however, led shares down 0.4 per cent to $54.03. Walmart dipped 1.2 per cent to $53.04.Hewlett-Packard added 0.5 per cent to $47.00, after first-quarter income beat consensus estimates.Healthcare was also a source of some support. Amgenadded 1.1 per cent to $55.26. JPMorgan reiterated its “outperform” rating on Gilead, citing the likelihood of approval for a key drug, boosting the shares by 1.9 per cent to $39.01.

398;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Amex joins Permira in push for RBS unit;;American Express, the credit card company, has teamed up with UK private equity house Permira to bid for Royal Bank of Scotland’s payment processing division, as buy-out groups bring in commercial partners for the £2.5bn ($3.6bn) auction.Atos Origin, the French IT services group, meanwhile, has joined the private equity consortium of CVC Capital Partners and Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe to bid for RBS’s Global Merchant Services division.Global Merchant Services is centred on the WorldPay payments business and incorporates the Streamline cards operation that dominates in the UK. RBS – 70 per cent owned by the UK taxpayer – must sell the unit under the terms of a European Commission state aid ruling.The bank has signalled that private equity buyers may need to link with strategic partners to prove they have the capability to run the complex payments business, according to people familiar with the sale.Global Merchant Services handles more than half the UK’s face-to-face transactions using payment cards such as Visa and MasterCard. RBS is understood to have some concerns that a pure private equity buyer may not have the scale or expertise to manage the business.All groups declined to comment, but two bidders said the technical and commercial challenges of carving out the Global Merchant Services business from RBS meant that private equity groups could benefit from having strategic partners.While the division processes 500 credit and debit card payments per second – one bidder said it had “five-nine” precision, meaning it was reliable 99.999 per cent of the time – the division’s IT system is old and may need updating soon.American Express processes payments for millions of customers in 130 countries and its experience could help the RBS division to expand in emerging markets.Atos Origin has been interested in the auction since the start, but the French IT services group failed to reach the second round, forcing it to join forces with a rival bidder.There are still a number of other bidders in the fray, including Moneris, the Canadian card payments company and pure private equity buyers TPG, Warburg Pincus and a consortium of Advent International and Bain Capital.The bidders have until May 31 to submit second-round bids.
399;V;Visa Inc;2010-05-14T23:45:29Z;Shares fall on US debit card fees plan;;A proposal to regulate fees paid by US retailers on debit card swipes in the Senate’s financial reform bill led to a sharp drop in the shares of Visa, MasterCard and leading banks on Friday.The amendment would enable the Federal Reserve to alter so-called interchange fees, or the fees paid by merchants to issuers of debit cards such as Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase.It was sponsored by Dick Durbin, senior Democratic senator from Illinois, and approved late on Wednesday night.Investors saw potential impact on revenue for Visa and MasterCard – which collect the interchange fees and pass them to the banks – from reduced payments by the banks to use their networks and additional regulatory scrutiny.Banks received $15.8bn in interchange fees on debit card transactions from US merchants last year, according to the Nilson Report.“If the Durbin amendment becomes law, the question is, will the Fed regulate not just the pure interchange fees, which are revenue only for the issuing banks, but also Visa and MasterCard’s debit fees?” said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at UBS.The credit card payment network companies – once industry utilities that were spun off and sold to the public in recent years – saw their shares dip sharply.Visa fell 9.9 per cent to $77.26, and MasterCard dropped 8.6 per cent to $212.45.However, both have seen their share price recover more than 45 per cent since 2009 as consumer spending has revived, along with the use of credit and debit cards.“Nothing in Durbin’s amendment directly impacts Visa or MasterCard’s revenues or earnings-per-share, in our view,” said Adam Frisch, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “The biggest harm, at least near term, to the stocks could be the perception that this bill hinders growth.”Mr Durbin is a long-term critic of the fees, which merchants have argued are too high because the payment system does not have enough competition.“Passage of this measure gives small businesses and their customers a real chance in the fight against the outrageously high ‘swipe fees’ charged by Visa and MasterCard,” Senator Durbin said.David Robertson, of the Nilson Report, a payment industry newsletter, said: “Merchants are willing to a large degree to pay for credit transactions, because they figure consumers might be spending money they don’t have. But with the debit card, it’s the consumer’s own money, and so merchants want to pay the lowest fee possible.”In a statement, Visa said: “We hope Congress sees today’s amendment for what it is – an attempt by retailers to increase their profits at the expense of consumers.”MasterCard issued a similar statement calling on lawmakers to reject the amendment.Analysts discounted the likelihood the rules would become law. “We still think interchange fails to make it into the final compromise bill, given that key influential lawmakers in the House remain against it,” said Christopher Mammone, analyst at Deutsche Bank.The largest bank issuers of debit cards were also hit. Citigroup was down 2.7 per cent to $3.98, JPMorgan slipped 2.3 per cent to $39.89 and Bank of America was off 3.1 per cent to $16.34.However, in spite of the broad regulatory uncertainty hanging over the industry, the S&P 500 financial sector is still up 6.6 per cent in 2010, compared with a gain of 1.9 per cent for the overall S&P 500 index.Over the past month, risk premiums – or spreads – on bank bonds have risen from 60bp to 130bp.But both Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were able this week to raise money by selling new bonds.

Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.John Stoltzfus, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said: “Markets that had
rallied earlier this week have been paring those gains as consideration of the ramifications of austerity programmes tied to the bail-out on regional and even global growth are being weighed.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was 1.9 per cent lower at 1,135.68 but 2.2 per cent up on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.5 per cent to 10,620.16, leaving it 2.3 per cent higher on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite had dropped
2 per cent to 2,346.85 but was up 3.6 per cent over the five days.A spike in volatility was indicated by the Vix climbing 18 per cent on Friday to 31.48. Credit card companies declined after the Senate’s decision. Visa was down
9.9 per cent to $77.26, MasterCard pulled back 8.6 per cent to $212.45, American Expressfell 5 per cent to $40.64 and Capital One Financial lost 4.8 per cent to $42.76.Financials were also in focus during the week following reports that Andrew Cuomo, New York’s attorney-general, had opened an investigation into whether eight banks misled rating agencies about past securities deals.Banks including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, now owned by Bank of America, were reported to have been served subpoenas on Wednesday.Citigroup was down

was 3.1 per cent lower at $16.34.Headline retail sales in April were higher than expected but core retail sales, which exclude petrol, car dealers and building materials, fell 0.2 per cent – the first decline of the year.Nordstrom was 3.7 per cent lower on Friday to $39.76 as the upmarket department store chain posted a first-quarter profit that missed average analyst estimates.JC Penney declined 2.2 per cent to $27.54 as the department store chain reported first-quarter results and gave modest second-quarter and full-year earnings guidance.Weaker crude oil prices put pressure on energy stocks. ConocoPhillips was one of the worst performers on Friday, losing 1.9 per cent to $55.84.Chevron fell 1.4 per cent to $77.83 and ExxonMobil was down 1.8 per cent to $63.60.Sybase was up 0.7 per cent to $64.65 over the week after Germany’s SAP, the world’s largest enterprise software maker, said on Wednesday that it would acquire the company for $5.8bn.The price, $65 a share, represents a 44 per cent premium to Sybase’s three-month average stock price.Online film rental company Netflix fell 8.6 per cent to $100.56 as the stock was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” at Citigroup and cut from “buy” to “neutral” at Merriman Curhan Ford.Shares of aluminium refiner Noranda Aluminum rallied 6 per cent to $8.80 on their market debut on Friday but JinkoSolar, a China-based maker of solar cells, was flat at $11.01 on their first trading day.Wave2Wave Communications postponed its initial public offering due to poor market conditions."
401;V;Visa Inc;2010-05-04T20:01:53Z;Rebound boosts MasterCard;;MasterCard has said it benefited from a rebound in consumer spending, particularly in Asia and Latin America but slowly fanning across the globe.The world’s second-largest payment network said on Tuesday that US purchase volumes turned positive in March for the first time in 18 months, and that growth continued in April.“We are seeing people feel a bit more comfortable, and they are starting to spend more on discretionary items,” said Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer.MasterCard’s first-quarter net profit was $455m, or $3.46 per share, compared with $367m, or $2.80 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 13 per cent to $1.3bn.Worldwide purchase volume climbed 8.7 per cent in the period, but much of that growth came from countries outside the US, including Latin America, Asia and Africa. US purchase volume grew 1 per cent, better than the nearly 7 per cent decline a year ago.“While credit growth in the US was still negative, we’ve moved beyond the double-digit declines of previous quarters,” said Robert Selander, who will be succeeded as chief executive on July 1 by Ajay Banga, currently MasterCard’s president and chief operating officer.Debit card volumes grew 13 per cent worldwide and 7 per cent in the US. MasterCard’s credit and charge programmes fared less well, growing just 7 per cent around the globe and declining 3 per cent in the US.On Monday, the Federal Reserve released its quarterly survey of senior loan officers, which showed that card issuers continued to tighten credit in the first quarter. Card issuers have been closing inactive accounts and eliminating credit for high-risk borrowers in the wake of the financial crisis and new restrictions on lending, which are expected to cost them an estimated $12bn in lost revenue.Most analysts, however, said the cycle of credit reduction was nearing an end. “Personal consumption is coming back and it’s starting to look more like a V-shaped recovery,” said Bruce Harting, an analyst with Barclays Capital.Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse said credit card issuers had started marketing again, albeit to a narrower audience.MasterCard’s results were not quite as strong as those reported last month by larger rival Visa, which saw worldwide payment volumes grow 13 per cent. The two companies have been battling to sign up customers. Aside from consumers’ willingness to spend, card issuers face another problem. Amendments to financial reform legislation making its way through Congress propose limiting interchange fees, which a merchant’s bank pays to a card issuing banks on each transaction.

Agitation subsided across bourses on Thursday as the promise of a fresh relief package for Greece and more good earnings provided some soothing balm to counteract the market’s sovereign debt irritant.The FTSE All-World equity index rose 1.2 per cent and the euro made ground as traders took stock following two days of volatility.“The risk trade returns cautiously as the Fed extends its policy accommodation and euro shorts scale down positioning in anticipation of EU/IMF deal,” said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The market’s latest wobble had been caused by the downgrading of the debt of Greece, Portugal and Spain by ratings agency Standard & Poor’s.S&P’s moves crystallised the concerns that have been intermittently roiling markets during recent months – namely the fear that fiscal problems in Greece represent a harbinger for sovereign debt crises elsewhere, rather than merely an outlier.But southern Europe produced good debt news during the session, with a multi-year loan deal of €30bn from governments plus €15bn from the IMF to be ready in a matter of days, according to the European Commission. Italy, the best-off economy of the sub-region, successfully sold €3bn in three-year bonds in an auction, a welcome signal that contagion risk had eased somewhat.Stock traders did not suffer for catalysts on the day, as they also had stronger-than-expected US job figures and earnings from Visa, the CME Group, and Hugo Boss. This helped Wall Street to a 1.3 per cent advance, its strongest since early March.The CBOE’s Vix volatility index dropped nearly 12 per cent, its steepest fall since way back in February 2009, when the market’s bull run was just beginning.However, the market was still signalling that global risk is at elevated levels by continuing to buy US Treasury bonds despite the myriad pressures, ranging from rising stocks and Fed funds rates to continuing massive auctions, against them.“It will still be a while before global investors put their toes back in Europe,” said John Brady, senior vice president of hedge fund sales at brokerage MF Global, “and so will allocate that marginal capital to US treasury markets, where there are still dis-inflationary pressures in the economy.”● The promise of a solid start in New York and a rebound in eurozone “peripheral” debt has helped European bourses rise for the first day in three. The FTSE 100 in London added 0.6 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1.3 per cent, with banks having a better time. Greek banks also jumped, pushing Athens higher by 7.1 per cent. Lisbon gained 4.6 per cent and Madrid rose 2.7 per cent.Asia stabilised after Wednesday’s sharp fall, bolstered by US markets' confident reaction to the Federal Reserve’s steady rate outlook. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index was fractionally lower, receiving no support from Japan, which was closed for a public holiday.Mainland China continued to struggle, however, falling 1.1 per cent as the government’s moves to curb speculation weighed on sentiment. This is Shanghai’s sixth consecutive day of losses and leaves it at its worst closing level since October. Hong Kong fell 0.8 per cent.● A calmer mood prevailed in the “peripheral” eurozone sovereign bond complex as traders hoped that the proposed aid package for Greece could reduce the chance of a debt restructuring.Greek 10-year bond yields tumbled 91bp to 9.03 per cent, and 2-year bond yields dropped 302bp to 12.86 per cent. The cost of insuring Greek bonds against default – as measured via credit default swaps – fell 8 per cent.Portuguese 10-year notes fell 39bp to 5.43 per cent, and the nation’s CDS fell 6 per cent, as contagion fears receded.The yield on Spanish 10-year notes fell 9 basis points to 4.08 per cent, a lower level than before the S&P downgrade on Wednesday.The yield on US 10-year Treasuries fell 3bp to 3.73 after a record auction of $32bn of 7-year paper, part of a round of $129bn to be auctioned this week. There was good buyer demand at the auction, with bonds pricing at a yield 1bp below the market price. In later trading they were down 4bp to yield 3.17 per cent.● The euro climbed 0.1 per cent to $1.3238, as sentiment towards the eurozone improved following news that German engineering orders had risen for the year to March by 21 per cent. Moody’s confirmation of Ireland’s credit rating also provided support for the single currency.The dollar reversed an early advance to fall 0.4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis to 82.03.● Copper led the metals sector lower, with traders concerned about what the continued slide in the Shanghai stock market was saying about future demand from China. The red metal fell 0.7 per cent to $3.36 a pound.Oil tracked stock market moves, rising 2.5 per cent to $85.31 a barrel, its highest in a month. Gold rose 0.1 per cent to $1,167 an ounce.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm
404;V;Visa Inc;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Financial institutions: Rebound is on the cards in banking;;"A year ago financial brands were still reeling from the after-effects of the global banking crisis of autumn 2008, so it was little surprise that the category was one of the worst performing in the April 2009 Top 100, beaten to the wooden spoon only by the lamentable performance of cars and insurers.But, after falling 11 per cent in last year’s ranking, the financial institutions category has bounced back, rising 12 per cent in the 2010 list – more than any of the other 16 categories.The bald figures are flattering, however. The recovery is due in large measure to a very strong performance by brands that have been relatively well insulated from the credit crisis because of their business model, conservative approach to lending or location. Four of the 20 are in this year’s list of top 20 risers by brand value.Pride of place goes to the two big card payment companies, MasterCard and Visa, whose brand values rose 57 and 52 per cent respectively. Cristiana Pearson, an MBO director, attributes this in part to the brands’ growing presence beyond credit cards, with the expanding use of debit cards for small payments, and pre-paid cards. “In emerging markets in particular, you are seeing a rise in the way that people pay for things like utility bills and other sorts of basic bills, which used to be by cheque or cash,” she says.Joanna Seddon, MBO’s chief executive, adds that in China, workers are receiving their pay on credit cards – “your pay is a card and you go and deal with it in a bank”. Elsewhere, she says an increasing number of US airlines have switched from cash to credit card for small purchases by passengers. Another strength, according to Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, is that paying by debit prevents a large monthly credit card bill from building up. “That’s a smart move in times of recession,” he says.This healthy scenario for the card payment brands is confirmed by Antonio Lucio, Visa’s global chief marketing officer. “I’d attribute the improvement in Visa’s brand position to two key factors,” he says. “First, Visa’s product mix includes debit, pre-paid and credit, and that diversity gives us tremendous resilience in challenging economic times.“Second, our marketing efforts are gaining real traction. The ‘More People Go with Visa’ campaign and its recent Olympic Games extension, ‘Go World’, were the first global campaigns in Visa’s history. Together they’re delivering excellent returns.”Compared with Visa and MasterCard, American Express has been more exposed to the broader financial crisis, says MBO, and less to some of the factors that have boosted its two rivals. So its brand value has fallen by 7 per cent.The other two big risers in this sector were Goldman Sachs – currently facing mounting threats to its reputation following US fraud charges – and HSBC. Goldman, up 25 per cent, was the bank that predicted the crisis, says MBO, and consequently did not suffer as the other banks did. As well as having a record financial year, its brand value is also up across most countries.HSBC’s 23 per cent rise in brand value is attributed partly to its strength in Asia, but also to the creation of a global brand from scratch via acquisitions over the past seven years. “They’re positioned around values, the idea of celebrating global diversity,” says Ms Seddon. “They’ve really been pushing their global brand marketing around something that is a bigger idea than banking.”Nick Cooper, MBO’s senior vice-president in the UK and Europe, adds that HSBC also emerged with clean hands from the credit crisis, and with no state aid. “They’ve obviously picked up a lot of business from other brands that have done less well,” he says.Other good performers in this sector include Barclays, which also did not take any public funding and has been investing heavily in its brand; Chase, buoyed by its acquisition of Washington Mutual but also by avoiding serious trouble in the credit crisis; and Royal Bank of Canada, helped by its home country’s conservative banking laws, and a beneficiary of the fall-out from the financial turmoil. Through acquisitions in the US over recent years it has been building a North American identity via its RBC branding – “it’s difficult to expand to the southern American states if you’re called the Royal Bank of Canada”, says Ms Seddon.Then there is Santander, with its strong position in Latin America offsetting the financial crisis in Spain, but also benefiting from overt brand promotion through its sponsorship of Formula One motor racing. Ms Seddon forecast a further big rise in brand value for the “monolithic” Santander in next year’s ranking as brands it has acquired, including Abbey in the UK, are renamed.Overall, the top 20 in this sector underlines how the world of banking has changed in the past five years. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Citi and Bank of America brands were jostling for top place, but now it is China’s ICBC, up 15 per cent this year, that heads the ranking (see table).“[ICBC] really does have a strong brand – you mightn’t think so from looking at its name but it does,” says Ms Seddon. Bank of China and China Construction Bank occupy fourth and fifth places, respectively, while India’s ICICI makes its debut in 10th slot. Meanwhile, Bank of America and Citi have fallen to 9th and 12th.Looking ahead, however, it is not all about the inexorable rise of the Asian bank brands. Four of the top 20 brands – Visa, Santander, RBC and Bank of America – are in the overall top 10 for “brand momentum”, a forward-looking measure of a brand’s potential. A strong presence in emerging markets is one reason for this.RankBrandBrand value $mBrand contributionBrand momentumBrand value changeTwo-year CAGR"
405;V;Visa Inc;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Fastest risers and worst fallers;;Samsung takes the prize for fastest-rising brand in this year’s BrandZ Top 100 – an 80 per cent increase takes its brand value to $11.3bn, allowing the Korean electronics group to power its way back into the Top 100, in 68th place, after a one-year absence.The company’s television business has been performing “incredibly well”, says Cristiana Pearson, a director at Millward Brown Optimor. Joanna Seddon, MBO’s chief executive, adds: “The TV business is very strongly branded and Samsung has the strongest brand in LCD [liquid crystal display] TVs, that’s really a lot of what this is about.”Close behind is Baidu, the Chinese internet search engine, which makes its first appearance in the Top 100 after a 62 per cent rise in brand value to $9.4bn, putting it in 75th place. Baidu is also one of just two brands – Skol is the other, in the beer category – to achieve a maximum 10 for brand momentum, which indicates each brand’s short-term growth potential.Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, says Baidu is one of the most trusted brands in China. This is due partly to the fact that a majority of Chinese think they do a better job than Google at picking up the nuances of different Chinese dialects, according to MBO.Sandwiched between MasterCard and Visa (covered in the article on Financial Institutions) in the top 20 risers table is Next, the UK clothes retailer, with a 54 per cent rise in brand value to $2.6bn (well short of the Top 100). “Next is a recovery brand, it was down 40 per cent last year so has recovered its value,” says Ms Pearson. “It has tried to adopt the Zara/H&M model of quick turnround of trends and moving its products fast through the stores. It has also adopted a strategy of moving from the cities to larger spaces in retail parks, which has been quite successful.”Then comes Hewlett-Packard, the US technology hardware and IT services group, with a 48 per cent rise in brand value to $39.7bn. This reflects the rebranding of EDS to the HP brand and a brand repositioning, with a new logo and “Let’s do amazing” tagline.“This tagline is all about innovation, it’s things like networking in space, monitoring vibrations on the Golden Gate Bridge, running security systems in Vegas, printing documents off a mobile phone,” says Ms Pearson.“HP has historically not been run as one brand, every division was pretty independent,” says Ms Seddon. Under Mark Hurd [HP’s chief executive] that has changed, it’s one global brand, one idea which is this idea about unleashing new possibilities, of being a catalyst for creation, helping businesses and individuals all around the world.”The booby prize for biggest fall in brand value goes to Nokia, which dropped 30 places to 43rd place after a 58 per cent decline to $14.9bn. This is not a trust issue – in fact it is the most trusted brand in about ten of the 22 countries covered in the BrandZ ranking, says Mr Walshe. “The brand does very well, the issue is that Nokia has sort of missed the smartphone wave,” says Ms Pearson. Ms Seddon adds: “People haven’t been buying it. They’ve also been selling widgets rather than handsets. So, Apple is selling access to exciting applications and Nokia’s been selling phones.”Two more technology brands suffered the second- and fourth-biggest declines in brand value. Intel’s was down 38 per cent at $14.2bn, resulting in a fall of 25 places to 48th. The chipmaker’s brand declined because market capitalisation fell, and the brand contribution element slipped slightly.As for Siemens, the German industrial group, its brand value fell 31 per cent to $9.3bn. It is doing fine financially, says MBO. However, its brand contribution has declined and its brand multiple has declined a lot, too. Its earnings went up while market valuation went down. Therefore, market outlook is less positive than it was a year ago. Porsche, the German sports car group, also sustained a 31 per cent fall, to $12bn.Sandwiched between Intel and the two German brands on the list of biggest fallers is Disney, down 21 places to 41st after brand value fell 35 per cent to $15bn. None of their businesses have been doing particularly well, says MBO – and in a recession, it can be an expensive day out for a family. “It’s discretionary leisure, isn’t it?” says Mr Walshe.Samsung80%Baidu62%MasterCard57%Next54%Visa52%HP48%Verizon Wireless39%Apple32%IBM30%Sony30%Amazon29%Goldman Sachs25%HSBC23%O223%Skol22%Gatorade22%Corona21%Evian21%Budweiser20%T-Mobile20%
406;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa buys Cybersource in e-commerce push;;Visa on Wednesday accelerated its push into online payments and e-commerce, agreeing to buy Cybersource, an electronic payments company, for about $2bn in cash.The deal, which values Cybersource at about $26 a share, comes just a week after rival MasterCard launched a new division dedicated to bringing to market faster different forms of payment.The traditional payment processors are manoeuvring to ensure their position is not eclipsed by emerging technology and online rivals such as PayPal. American Express last year announced it was buying Revolution Money, an online processor, for $300m.Cybersource, which helps retailers protect themselves against fraudulent online payments using its software, processes about a quarter of all US ecommerce transactions, by dollar value.The company counts British Airways, Home Depot and Facebook among its clients and last year had revenues of $265m and net income of $11m.About 8 per cent of Cybersource’s revenues came from outside the US in the fourth quarter of last year.The deal with Visa should help to spur the company’s international growth, with Asia and Latin America expected to be early priorities.The price reflects about a 34 per cent premium to where Cybersource shares closed on Tuesday.That values Cybersource at about 19 to 20 times adjusted 2011 earnings, according a source close to the deal – roughly in line with where Visa itself trades.The acquisition of Cybersource would leave few sizable businesses for rivals looking to accelerate in electronic payments. PayPal, which is owned by Ebay, is rapidly growing its activity away from the online auction site and is becoming more important to the company as its auction model falls out of favour with consumers.Cybersource, which was founded in 1994, listed on Nasdaq in 1999 as the dotcom bubble approached its apex.The company greatly expanded its presence among small businesses with the acquisition of Authorize.net in 2007 and now works with more than 295,000 merchants using both brands.Visa and Cybersource have worked together since 1999 and Cybersource’s chief executive, Michael Walsh, will stay on to oversee its operations.Shares in Visa slipped 0.61 per cent to $93.48 in afternoon trade in New York. Cybersource stock jumped almost 32 per cent to trade at $25.65 a share.JPMorgan advised Visa on the deal while Goldman Sachs acted for Cybersource.
407;V;Visa Inc;2010-04-21T15:59:35Z;Interest rate pricing on credit cards ‘confusing’;;Confusing new pricing mechanisms are making it hard for large numbers of consumers to prejudge what rate they will be offered when they take out a credit card, according to financial research company Defaqto.Many credit card providers now use ‘personal pricing’ where the interest rate charged is based on the individuals details, credit record and repayment history. For tose who are actually offered a credit card typically two thirds will get the best rate but up to one third will be offered a higher rate.David Black, banking specialist at Defaqto, said: “It always used to be fairly straightforward to get a credit card but providers have become increasingly choosy about who they will lend to and, if they will lend, at what rate. Many consumers don’t even get to that stage because the number of credit card applications being rejected has shot up.”Most credit card summary boxes only detail the typical APR but there are a number that also show the higher rates that may be offered. For example, Capital One gives a typical rate of 14.9 per cent but customers could end up with a rate of 24.9 per cent.Similarly, Egg advertises a rate of 16.9 per cent as a typical rate but could give someone up to 21.9 per cent. Then there is Vanquis Bank which typically charges 39.9 per cent interest on its Visa card, but could offer potential customers anything up to 59.9 per cent.Becky Paterson, a spokesperson for Capital One said: “We use personal pricing on some of our products. We do this to ensure that an applicant has the best chance of being accepted for a credit card rather than receiving a straight decline.“In cases where we use personal pricing, we make it clear to an applicant that there are two different interest rates available for the product for which they are applying - for example on our Plus card the interest rate will be either 14.9 per cent or 24.9 per cent depending on the applicant’s individual circumstances.”Ms Paterson, added that the interest rates they offer are based on an applicant’s risk profile. “Providing credit to people with a less robust or more limited credit history is considered a higher risk, which is why we offer a higher interest rate of 24.9% to some applicants in this category,” she said.
408;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard raises technology focus;;MasterCard will on Thursday announce the launch of a newly created division dedicated to bringing products to market faster, the latest sign that the world’s second-largest payments network is trying to become more nimble as it competes against newer groups such as PayPal.MasterCard plans to invest tens of millions of dollars in the new division – called MasterCard Labs – which will be staffed globally by technology engineers and business development executives.“The secular trend of moving from cash and cheques to other forms of payments will accelerate, especially in countries other than the US,” said Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s new chief executive. “To stay ahead of that curve, we’ve got to create the right partnership and team work.”The new division will be headed by Gary Lyons, who had served as chief of Orbiscom, a payment technology company that MasterCard acquired in 2008.While at Orbiscom, Mr Lyons developed a system called inControl, which gives credit card users more of a say in how their payments are made. Accounts can be set up so that certain payments are made by debit and others on credit.Parents who give their children credit cards can also block their use in certain stores. The system also allows customers to set up limits that prevent them from spending more than a certain amount each month in a certain place.Mr Banga said the goal of the new lab was to churn out more products such as inControl, as well as others that MasterCard has recently introduced. These include MoneySend – which allows customers to transfer money from one MasterCard to another via ATM machines, the internet or mobile phones – and a partnership unveiled last week with Next Jump, an internet data tracking company, which will create an online shopping mall tailored to cardholders’ likely shopping habits. Visa, the largest payments network, and American Express, the number three, are also stepping up their product development pipelines.In November, American Express bought Revolution Money, an online payment processor, and Visa has told investors that it plans to increase spending on research and development.“There is a healthy paranoia that you don’t want to be eclipsed by some new method of payment,” said Barclays analyst Bruce Harting.Like Visa, MasterCard’s strength has historically been in processing large numbers of payments for commercial customers, rather than in making loans or developing niche markets. “In the past, we may have missed some opportunities, because we weren’t necessarily as good at taking an idea and building it into a prototype,” said Josh Peirez, who heads its business development unit.
409;V;Visa Inc;2010-04-13T00:58:50Z;MasterCard names Banga as new CEO;;MasterCard named a former Citigroup executive to succeed chief executive Robert Selander, who is retiring at the end of this year.Indian-born Ajay Banga joined MasterCard in August as chief operating officer with the expectation that he would be offered the opportunity to replace Mr Selander. He will assume his duties as chief executives July 1. Mr Banga is also joining the board, effective immediately.Mr Banga, who spent 13 years at Citigroup, where he oversaw the company’s international global consumer group, said he planned to focus on emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America, while also building on MasterCard’s internet and mobile commerce businesses.Mr Selander, who became chief executive in 1997 and spearheaded the company’s high-profile initial public offering in 2006, will remain executive vice-chairman and retain his board seat until he retires in December.The two executives spoke on Monday from Singapore, where MasterCard was holding its board meeting. Among the qualifications that singled out Mr Banga for MasterCard’s top job was his international experience, Mr Selander said, adding that such experience, combined with his financial background, “made him the perfect CEO to lead MasterCard into the next generation”.Because MasterCard only processes payments and does not make loans, the company – like Visa – has not been hurt as much as credit card issuers by rising delinquencies and defaults.
410;V;Visa Inc;2010-03-31T13:16:41Z;Compass expects to return to growth;;Compass Group, the world’s largest contract catering company, said organic revenues had returned to growth in the second quarter, beating analyst expectations thanks to easing comparatives and new business in its North America division.In a trading statement ahead of the caterer’s half-year end on March 31, Compass said organic revenue was expected to rise by about 1.5 per cent in the second quarter, compared with a decrease of 1.7 per cent in the first quarter and a decline of 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.In North America and Canada, which together account for about 44 per cent of group revenue, organic sales are expected to rise by about 2 per cent in the first half of the year, lifted by new business and high levels of retention among existing customers.“Overall the pace of recovery has come through quicker than expected,” said Greg Johnson, analyst at Shore Capital. “Part of the reason is easier comparatives, but the momentum has also been regained because fewer people are getting laid off relative to last year, particularly in the US.”A large part of Compass’s core business has remained relatively defensive amid the recession, such as providing catering and support services to schools, healthcare providers and the military.In contrast, revenues from hospitality for sports and leisure events and corporate catering such as staff canteens, have suffered due to their more cyclical nature.However, analysts say this means the company should also be well-positioned to benefit from economic recovery.Compass said it had recently signed contracts to provide catering for Shell and Visa in the USA, as well as Pfizer in Australia, Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Johnson & Johnson in Brazil.Operating in more than 50 countries and serving about 4bn meals annually, Compass said that while organic revenue in the first half was expected to be “broadly flat”, new contracts and a stabilisation in like-for-like volumes would likely deliver “modest” organic revenue growth in the second half of the year.Cost-cutting and efficiencies mean the group now expects a 50 basis points improvement in operating margin in the first half of the year.Consensus analyst forecasts suggest the company will generate pre-tax profit of £870m on revenue of £13.7bn in the full-year to September 2010. In 2009, Compass made £13.4bn in sales and pre-tax profit of £773m.Shares in Compass added 1.1 per cent, or 6p, to 532½p in morning trade.
411;V;Visa Inc;2010-03-16T07:05:43Z;Cashing in on mobile memory cards;;Themobile wallet  is one of those mythical beasts of the cell phone world that elusively stays away from mass-market implementation.However, an Oregon-based company called Tyfone has at least come up with a simple way to add the technology to millions of handsets.With more than 60 per cent of new phones containing memory slots for users to insert cards to boost storage capacity, Tyfone has added Near Field Communication (NFC) “u4ia” technology for contactless payments to a 1Gb MicroSD card.It means banks and other payments providers could offer the “SideTap” cards to customers to retrofit their phones to work with their services. Or handset owners could use the cards to handle a variety of payments.DeviceFidelity, a Texan company, is reported to be developing a similar MicroSD product with Visa, but without the use of it as a proper memory card.“Inside your wallet you may have a few credit cards, perhaps some gift cards or other prepaid payment cards, some money along with family photos, “says Siva Narendra, Tyfone chief technology officer.“We designed the u4ia [pronounced euphoria] technology to work just like a real wallet… a person does not have to be tied to a single financial institution nor are they limited to where they can use u4ia technology to make payments.”Tyfone announced today that First Data , the payment enabler for 5m merchant locations and 2,000 card issuers, would offer SideTap in the second half of the year.Contactless payment cards using NFC are popular in areas such as mass transit where they can be passed in front of a reader as users board buses or pass through barriers. The handset version will work in the same way and in similar locations including stores and self-service restaurants.
412;V;Visa Inc;2010-03-01T23:00:43Z;Aerospace: A longer range;;"There are all sorts of ways to think about a map of the world. Britons of a certain age grew up in classrooms with maps showing much of the globe satisfyingly covered in empire pink. Children of the cold war saw a world divided between red communist nations and the rest. To an executive of Airbus, the European aircraft maker, countries on the map have meanwhile come to look much the same – except for one that has long been disconcertingly different.It is Japan – which, alone among the world’s wealthiest nations, is a Boeing country. Airbus now has 54 per cent of the world’s aircraft orders. In Japan it has less than 5 per cent.Japan’s biggest airline, the recently bankrupted JAL, has never bought a new Airbus jet. The handful it has were inherited in a merger. JAL and All Nippon Airways, the next biggest carrier, have barely 50 Airbus jets between them and more than 340 Boeings. “It’s an unnatural situation,” says Tom Enders, Airbus chief executive. “Japan is one of the largest markets in the world and there is almost no Airbus.”But Mr Enders, a forthright former paratrooper, is trying to tackle that. He headed to Japan last week for the second time this year, as part of a concerted push into one of Boeing’s last bastions.If successful, it could open up a new chapter in the story of one of the world’s greatest commercial rivalries. Some in Airbus hope it could even help reconfigure the global commercial aircraft industry by putting the European group permanently on top.Japan is not merely the world’s second largest economy; it sits in the Asia-Pacific, which both Airbus and Boeing expect to become a bigger market than either the US or Europe over the next 20 years, accounting for about one-third of their deliveries.China has already become the world’s fastest-growing aviation market. Airbus has more than 500 of its jets flying there, about half the number it has in the US. Ending Boeing’s pre-eminence in Japan would give the European group an important boost in the great game to be played out in this dynamic region.As with anything to do with Airbus and Boeing, however, nothing will happen without an intense and gripping struggle. Few other corporate opponents compete as ferociously as the world’s two biggest makers of passenger aircraft. Unlike other global duopolists – Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Microsoft and Apple, Visa and MasterCard – it is not the case that the two are both American. With one of the rivals based in France, a frisson of geopolitics overlays the usual commercial tensions.Moreover, Boeing spent decades thinking of itself as the natural superior in the arrangement. It dominated much of the market from the dawn of the jet age and built the 747 jumbo that became one of the icons of the era. Airbus did not even exist when the jumbo had its first test flight, in February 1969. The European company dates its birth to May of that year, when French and German ministers signed an agreement jointly to build a passenger jet.The move was a conscious effort to end US rule. But few gave the awkwardly conceived European group much chance of beating Boeing, even when it started producing aircraft to rival the trusty output of Boeing’s Seattle assembly plant.One senior executive from a leading aircraft leasing firm remembers taking a flight across the US just after Northwest Airlines bought some Airbuses. “I got chatting to the guy next to me who turned out to be a pilot at Northwest and he said, ‘Those French guys should stick to making wines because they sure as hell can’t make airplanes’.”As it turned out, Airbus had more staying power than Northwest, which was taken over by Delta in 2008. By then, Airbus had been delivering more aircraft than Boeing for five years in a row, a feat it repeated last year. But Boeing has still beaten Airbus in terms of the value of deliveries for seven out of the last 10 years, according to the Virginia-based Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy. And the value of each company’s order backlog – an important indicator of future relative strength – remained almost identical in 2009 at just under $258bn (€191bn, £172bn).But Airbus’s ascent has stung its older rival and driven the contest between the0 two to fresh heights: in 2004 the US filed a case with the World Trade Organisation alleging the EU had illegally subsidised Airbus; the EU promptly filed a case making similar allegations against the US and Boeing. Neither dispute has yet been resolved.The political dimension to the competition has also been felt over the years by various customer airlines. A little more than 10 years ago, Airbus thought it had finally clinched a deal with Israel’s El Al, long a loyal Boeing customer. But when in 1999 it announced it was going to buy some of the European group’s jets, the move did not go down well in Washington. Officials in the administration of Bill Clinton made it clear that Americans and Congress would not understand why El Al was not buying Boeing planes. To this day, El Al only has Boeings.Airbus also benefited from political help over the years, says Doug McVitie, an aerospace analyst who was director of sales intelligence at Airbus in the 1990s. European airlines that resisted exhortations to buy its products, such as British Airways, a Boeing stalwart for many years, were resented at its Toulouse headquarters.“Airbus executives would have their expenses questioned if they flew on BA, they hated each other so much,” says Mr McVitie. “If they couldn’t find another way of flying, the expenses would be paid but it was seriously frowned on.”Airbus did crack BA, but not until 1998. And politics, says Mr McVitie, is a large part of the reason Airbus is “hardly likely” to break into Japan, where Boeing’s strength has been evident ever since the US occupation that followed the second world war.But nearly five decades of almost uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic party ended with last year’s general election, which brought a Democratic party-led government to power. Airbus is hoping this will create opportunities that previously did not exist. As Mr Enders diplomatically puts it: “I think the political environment is changing.”Boeing insists politics is largely irrelevant, at least compared with the commercial relationships it has carefully moulded in Japan. “We’ve been in Japan for more than 50 years and we have a very strong relationship with suppliers as well as customers and partners,” says Charlie Miller, a Boeing vice-president. “We estimate Boeing-related work in Japan supports nearly 13,000 jobs, which is more than 20 per cent of Japan’s total aerospace industry.”Boeing’s latest aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner, underlines the point: Japanese companies are making its wing boxes among other components. ANA is the aircraft’s launch customer.Airbus executives concede that Boeing’s deep web of relationships have made it a formidable presence in Japan. But it claims to have another weapon: its A380 superjumbo, the world’s largest passenger jet.The intense rivalry between Airbus and Boeing has seen each take big bets on aircraft they hope will pull them ahead. In Boeing’s case, it is the 787 Dreamliner, the first passenger jet to be built mostly of carbon fibre composites and the fastest selling jetliner ever built, with 876 orders from 57 customers around the world. For Airbus, it is the A380. Both were hit by delays, but the 787 has just had its first test flight and the A380 has been in service for more than two years.Airbus has long proclaimed the enormous A380 would put it on a whole new footing against Boeing. Finally, the company had a full range of aircraft to sell right across the market, from its 108-seat A318 to a superjumbo capable of carrying more than 800 people, more than Boeing’s 747.Japan, Airbus claims, is a country in need of the A380. Toulouse executives have drawn up charts showing how the A380 has helped Singapore Airlines, the first carrier to fly it, gain market share from JAL and ANA.On one chart, Airbus says SIA’s passenger volumes on the Singapore-Tokyo route rose 8 per cent between May and December 2008 compared with the same period the previous year, which was before the A380 entered service. Volumes on the same route sank 13 per cent for ANA, the chart says, and 19 per cent for JAL.John Leahy, Airbus’s top salesman, insists the “A380 effect” is even more pronounced when it comes to the premium traffic of business and first class passengers that are a significant source of international airlines’ revenue. “Singapore [Airlines] went from Singapore to Narita with the A380 and JAL lost almost all of their premium traffic going down to Singapore, because given a choice, people would take the 380,” he says. “And it takes an A380 to compete with an A380.”Not everyone agrees. Richard Aboulafia at Teal Group thinks Airbus will have a difficult time persuading the Japanese, or many other carriers, to sign up. “The A380 is not a plane people want to buy,” he says, noting more than half the 202 orders Airbus has had for the superjumbo came in the first three years since it started marketing it in 2001. The market clearly prefers the smaller and lighter A350 XWB jet that Airbus is now developing, he says, an aircraft that has attracted more than twice as many orders as the A380.“There’s something completely tone deaf about pitching the A380 in a market such as Japan, where the national flag carrier just went bankrupt because it was unable to cut capacity fast enough,” he adds.As for whether Airbus can permanently replace Boeing as the world’s leading aircraft maker, Mr Aboulafia says it comes down to the 787. “If the 787 works out as planned, or close to it, then Airbus will be lucky to regain 50 per cent of the market – and that would only happen if the A350XWB works out too,” he says. “But if something goes wrong with the 787 in terms of its operating economics and performance, then Airbus would certainly overtake Boeing.”So far, therefore, the jury is out. Mr Enders did not leave Tokyo last week with a bunch of orders for the A380, or for any other aircraft. A lot of people have underestimated his company over the years. But only the brave would count Boeing out just yet."
413;V;Visa Inc;2010-02-26T19:14:27Z;Nationwide offers £75 for account transfers;;What’s the deal?Nationwide building society is offering £75 for switching standing orders and direct debits from another bank to the society’s FlexAccount. The cash bonus is available to the society’s 5m existing FlexAccount holders and to new customers. It is aimed at boosting usage of the account, which is particularly competitive for overseas debit card transactions. Customers must hold, or be eligible for, the society’s Visa debit card and be registered for online use. New customers must open their FlexAccount online, while existing customers have to use the society’s online account transfer service. Once the switching request is made, the society contacts your other bank to arrange the transfer of payments, but it will not close down the old account. Applications have to be made by March 5. The £75 bonus is paid within eight weeks.Is this good?Bank switching incentives are often restricted to new account openings, so this offer stands out for also being open to existing FlexAccount holders. To benefit, customers must transfer all their direct debits, standing orders and bill payments from the other bank. But they will still qualify for the £75 even if there is a total of only one standing order or direct debit to switch. There is no requirement to credit their FlexAccount with salary or other payments. Aside from the £75 bonus, and unlike most banks, the society’s current account charges no fee for withdrawals from overseas cashpoints and makes no currency conversion charges in Europe.What’s the catch?FlexAccount pays no credit interest, and many accountholders may be reluctant to make it their main current account.What’s the alternative?Alliance & Leicester gives a £100 bonus to new Premier customers who switch direct debits and standing orders from another bank and pay in at least £500 a month from a non-A&L account. Mortgage and investment customers of Santander, A&L’s parent, are eligible for the bank’s Zero account. This pays 6 per cent interest for the first year and has no foreign exchange charges or overdraft fee. First Direct gives new 1st account customers a £100 bonus for depositing £1,500 a month.How do I find out more?Log on to www.nationwide.co.uk

Japan’s stock market saw IPOs dwindle to 49 offerings in 2008 and fall further to just 20 during the whole of last year, according to Dealogic.Weak domestic economic growth, a lack of venture capital invested in companies before they list and high volatility in the small-cap markets have all contributed to the slump in Japanese IPOs.According to data from Dealogic, $603m was raised from Japanese listings in 2009 compared with $20.1bn in 1998, the year that NTT DoCoMo listed. By comparison, Hong Kong raised about $30bn through listings last year, making it the world’s largest IPO market in 2009.The slump in new listings in Japan has weighed on the TSE’s earnings and, coupled with unfavourable market conditions, delayed its own IPO last year.Atsushi Saito, president of the TSE, recently called for the government to introduce tax breaks for new companies to help them grow and reverse the lacklustre IPO market in Japan.Analysts said a successful IPO by Dai-ichi could renew investor confidence at a time when market conditions in Japan are slightly better than last year.Otsuka Holdings, a pharmaceuticals group, is expected to seek a listing this year.Dai-ichi’s listing will bring into the market a large number of retail investors – the life assurer’s policyholders who will be receiving the shares.

Discover declined to appeal against the decision. Their agreement also ends counterclaims the company had made against Morgan Stanley, Discover said in a US regulatory filing. “We are delighted with the outcome,” a Morgan Stanley official said.Morgan Stanley spun off Discover in 2007 to sharpen its focus on investment banking, trading, asset management and retail brokerage businesses. As part of its spin-off deal, the bank had maintained a claim on as much as $1.5bn in pre-tax proceeds that the credit card business might collect from its then-unresolved antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard.Morgan Stanley had sued the card operators for preventing banks from issuing Discover cards after officials at the US Department of Justice had alleged their actions had violated antitrust regulations. Both Visa and MasterCard settled with Illinois-based Discover in 2008. Discover then refused to pay Morgan Stanley, arguing that its former parent had interfered with the antitrust settlement discussions.A former finance arm of the US retailing group Sears Roebuck, Discover had been hatched by Phil Purcell, who later ran Morgan Stanley. Sears folded the business into Dean Witter, a brokerage, and spun off the combined company to shareholders in 1993.Mr Purcell, then chief executive of Dean Witter Discover, merged his company with Morgan Stanley in 1997. Shortly before being ousted as Morgan CEO, Mr Purcell had unveiled plans to spin off Discover. His successor, John Mack, reversed them, then reconsidered.Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 0.04 per cent to close at $27.16 on Friday. Discover fell 0.01 per cent to $13.03.
416;V;Visa Inc;2010-02-09T00:01:47Z;Filing reveals Chinese wealth fund’s exposure;;China Investment Corporation, the Chinese sovereign wealth fund, is using exchange-traded funds to take positions on sectors ranging from healthcare to gold, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The filing showed that CIC’s largest US stock market investments were in miner Teck Resources, investment bank Morgan Stanley, asset manager BlackRock and Visa, the credit card company.About a quarter of its US portfolio was in exchange-traded funds, many of them provided by BlackRock’s iShares division. Investors ranging from hedge funds to retail customers have turned to ETFs, as they are known, because they are a low-cost and flexible way to take positions on sectors or entire markets.CIC’s ETF investments give it exposure to sectors such as healthcare, materials and consumer shares. Others are a bet on rising gold prices and a third group is pegged to international stock markets including those of China and Japan.In addition, CIC has small holdings in financial stocks including Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America and AIG. CIC, which is only about 30 months old, was given $200bn at its creation and expects another $200bn cash injection shortly from China’s bulging foreign reserve coffers. One person close to CIC said it earned more than $60bn in 2009. That would make CIC one of the more successful sovereign wealth funds in navigating treacherous markets after the financial meltdown.Many other sovereign wealth funds in Asia and in the Middle East have lost money by providing rescue funds to financial companies including Merrill Lynch and UBS.CIC’s $713m stake in BlackRock has risen dramatically since it committed to a share placement to help fund the asset manager’s purchase of Barclays Global Investors in the summer of 2009.CIC’s investments in commodities companies have also paid off. Its investment in Teck has doubled in value. It has also made money on its $1bn investment in Singapore-listed Noble Group.In spite of the Chinese government’s concerns about the US dollar, North America is the most popular destination for CIC’s foreign investments, according to data from Thomson Financial, followed by Latin America.CIC’s 9.9 per cent stake in Blackstone is not included in the SEC filing because CIC had not been formerly established at the time of the June 2007 investment. The Chinese government’s stake, which has increased to 10 per cent of Blackstone, is being held in a vehicle called Beijing Wonderful Corporation.

The labour department reported initial jobless claims had climbed to 480,000, raising concerns over the closely watched monthly employment report due out on Friday.Wall Street was already jittery after concerns over sovereign debt in Greece, Portugal and Spain had prompted heavy selling across Europe.The Vix index, which tracks market volatility through option prices and is known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped 19 per cent to 25.81.“Equities are really telling you what the expectations are here,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global. “With the S&P 500 down sharply, that is the strongest message that Friday’s expected jobs number is a little bit too optimistic.”According to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, analysts are expecting the labour department to report that the economy added jobs in January.The unemployment rate is forecast to have held steady at 10 per cent.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said Wall Street was more concerned with problems in Europe. “I can’t believe it’s the economic data: it’s all about this crisis in Europe and the strengthening of the US dollar, which is causing selling in risk assets.”Encouraging sales figures from the retail sector went largely unnoticed.The 29 retailers that posted their January results on Thursday recorded an average sales rise of 3.3 per cent after analysts had been expecting a 2.5 per cent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data.Discount stores provided the market with the biggest pleasant surprise while clothing stores catering to children and teenagers missed estimates by the widest margin.Macy’s jumped 2.7 per cent to $16.67 after the department store reported higher than expected revenue for the period, driven by strong online demand.Sales at Gap rose 5 per cent over the month after analysts had been expecting a 4.4 per cent increase, helping to boost its shares 2.4 per cent to $19.48.Abercrombie gave the market the biggest surprise, posting a sales rise of 8 per cent in January. Wall Street had been expecting sales to decline 8.4 per cent during the month. Shares in the youth fashion chain gained 3.9 per cent to $33.21.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Burger King Holdings climbed 2.9 per cent to $18.01 after the fast-food chain posted a higher quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting.Revenue growth was mainly driven by new restaurant openings.On a like-for-like basis, worldwide sales dropped 2 per cent and 3.3 per cent in the US and Canada, where the company has had to offer heavy discounts to offset high unemployment.Kraft Foods fell 0.3 per cent to $28.39, paring early declines. According to reports Kraft is planning a four-part $9.5bn debt issuance to fund its takeover of Cadbury.MasterCard added to losses in the financial sector, dropping 10.3 per cent to $222.11. The country’s second-largest credit card company failed to meet quarterly estimates due to severance charges and higher marketing expenses.Visa, the industry’s largest company, beat quarterly estimates after the close on Wednesday. But after early strength, its shares were down 0.6 per cent to $83.05.
418;V;Visa Inc;2010-02-02T22:53:37Z;BNY Mellon to buy back-office arm of PNC;;Bank of New York Mellon on Tuesday announced it would pay $2.31bn to acquire the back-office operations of PNC Financial Services Group, a deal that comes amid expectations that more financial firms will shed businesses to shore up their capital bases and pay off federal aid.The deal will allow PNC to exit a non-core business, while helping it raise money to repay $7.6bn in government troubled asset relief programme (Tarp) funds. PNC also said it would sell $3bn of common stock and as much as $2bn of senior notes to pay back federal aid.Jim Palermo, the co-chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon Asset Servicing, said he expects to see other banks make similar deals in the months ahead.“We think there is a fairly high likelihood that this type of consolidation will continue,” Mr Palermo said.Tom McKelvey, the chief operating officer of Capco, a financial consulting firm, said that banks, unlike companies in other industries that outsourced or slimmed down years ago, continued to own too much of the supply chain.“We are talking to a number of our clients about selling large components of their businesses,” he said.Mr McKelvey said that back-office functions such as reconciliation, syndication and settlement activities will increasingly reside with third parties who specialise in those areas, much the way Visa and Mastercard process credit card transactions but do not make loans.He said that only the nation’s six largest banks have scale in syndicated lending, making that an area ripe for divestiture by smaller players.State Street Corporation recently spent $1.87bn to acquire the securities services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, the large Italian banking group.And Citigroup this month sold its technology services division to India’s Wipro for $127m. Other banks that have sold back-office operations in recent years include Fifth Third Bank, Marshall & Ilsley and Synovus.Standard & Poor’s analyst Erik Oja said that in a better economy banks would prefer to keep their back-office operations, because they lessen their dependence on earning money through lending activities. “But in this economy, you are going to see more banks look to sell,” he said.A PNC spokesman pointed out that its sale of the back-office division, which handles processing for financial advisers, fund managers and brokers, was a strategic decision that was not simply motivated by financial concerns.He added that increasing its capital base and repaying Tarp were among the bank’s priorities this year.S&P’s Oja estimates that PNC will be able to repay the bulk of its Tarp funds by the end of this year, saving it $388m beginning in 2011.As a result, he raised his 2011 earnings estimate to $5.24 per share from $5.03 per share.PNC shares were down 1.83 per cent at $54.84 in afternoon trading.
419;V;Visa Inc;2010-01-19T22:42:05Z;UK debit card use to exceed cash for first time;;Debit card spending is on track to overtake cash as a payment method in the UK this year, according to Visa Europe, the card processor.The group, owned by the banks for which it processes payments, said on Tuesday that 77 per cent of its business was now done with debit cards, rather than credit cards, after a 10 per cent rise in debit card transactions last year.Although credit card spending was stagnant, debit card business boomed. Total card spending at “points of sale” was up 3.7 per cent to €856bn (£746bn).The busiest day for spending was December 23, when consumers performed more than 20m transactions and spent more than £1bn – up 28 per cent on the same day in 2008.Visa said the swing was driven by a continued shift away from the use of cash, with the average transaction value across Europe down 4 per cent to €50. But there is also some evidence that, amid the recession, consumers have used debit cards to pay for purchases, rather than build up debt on credit cards.Underpinning that trend has been a rise in the number of retailers charging commissions, or “booking fees”, for payment with a credit card. Retailers are barred from making such charges on debit card transactions, but justify the credit card levies on the grounds that they are passing on so-called interchange fees charged by banks.Online shopping has also driven growth, with a quarter of all Visa spending in the UK conducted online over the Christmas period and 20 per cent for the year as a whole. “The growth in e-commerce is really staggering. The proportion has doubled in four years,” said Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe.December e-commerce spending across Europe on Visa cards was up 37 per cent.The trends in card spending were a “good barometer of how people were feeling”, Mr Ayliffe said, and showed that the start of last year was the “low point” for consumer confidence. There had also been a bounce back in the second half of the year in the use of cards abroad as foreign travel increased again.Visa Europe, which describes itself as a “not-for-profit membership association”, spun off from the US-based Visa Inc, generated €709m of revenue last year, up 5 per cent. Pre-tax profits, of €54m, will be retained to buttress capital to a level of €503m.
420;V;Visa Inc;2009-12-29T19:15:20Z;How much further can travel restrictions go?;;"As officials in the US and elsewhere assess the lessons of last Friday’s security failure, including how a passenger whose name was on watch lists in the US and UK was able to board a US-bound aircraft, the key questions before them are:Is there a case for extending a “no-fly” ban to all suspect individuals?Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was placed on the US’s 550,000-name extended watchlist, known as the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide), after his father alerted authorities. That might back the case for putting all Tide suspects on a no-fly list. But it would also potentially open the way for malicious reporting by anyone with a grudge against an individual. An unwieldy and inaccurate list could defeat its own purpose and open up challenges by civil liberties groups. The rules governing a UN list of al-Qaeda and Taliban suspects were recently changed because of legal challenges.Can co-operation between national intelligence agencies be enhanced?There is already considerable intelligence sharing between close allies such as the US and UK. But the prime purpose of each agency is the defence of its own country’s interests. In the latest case, Britain barred the Nigerian because he applied for a visa for a bogus college course rather than because he was thought to pose a terrorist threat to the UK.Should US and other authorities tighten visa requirements?Visa requirements are much tougher than before the September 11 2001 attacks. Citizens from countries such as the UK, who do not require a US visa, must now provide advance information on their travel plans. Others are issued visas by US embassies abroad administered by the state department. Incoming foreigners must give a full set of fingerprints and be photographed – but that
is after their flight has landed.What is the state of current technology?In June the US House of Representatives voted for $15.7bn (€11bn, £9.9bn) funding for the Transportation Security Administration for 2010-2011. The TSA plans to push ahead with deployment of full body scanners, with the proviso that they are costly, still being tested and are intrusive – a “virtual strip search”, according to
privacy advocates.The June bill also covers advanced self-defence training for flight crews and the deployment of sniffer dogs. A TSA public-private partnership to speed up security queues by creating special lanes for travellers willing to pay to have their biometric details on file hit a setback this year when the leading provider filed for bankruptcy.Should the US and other countries adopt the Israeli model?Israel has the tightest airline security on the world and El Al, the national carrier, boasts it is the world’s most secure airline. But the system involves intensive passenger profiling and intrusive questioning. Israeli authorities deny they use ethnic profiling, although anecdotal evidence is that security personnel are more alert to the potential threat from non-white and non-Jewish travellers."

Group pre-tax losses for the year to December 30 were flat at £13.7m.“Break-even in the UK will validate the model but it won’t be seen at the group level as there will be investments elsewhere,” said Rajeev Bahl, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. He added that subscriber numbers in the UK were more likely to accelerate as more operators and retailers like Tesco began offering the iPhone.Monitise will also deepen its accelerate into the UK market in a joint venture with Carphone Warehouse, which will also subscribe for £2.5m of new shares.The backing for the group was such that it was able to conduct a third consecutive fundraising at a premium to the market. Around £7.4m was raised on Thursday at an 8 per cent premium and a further £8.4m next year at a 25 per cent premium. However the latter is dependent on partners completing joint venture agreements by the end of March 2009. Shares in the group traded up ¾p at 12¾p.The joint venture in Asia plans to first launch in the more advanced Hong Kong market next year, before tackling mainland China.Mobile phone banking does not exist in China. “The potential of this type of service in China is huge,” Mr Chu said.The roll-out period will partly depend on how quick the venture receives regulatory approval from Chinese authorities, who are likely to tread cautiously given the potential security issues surrounding mobile phone banking.Elsewhere in the region, Monitise is waiting for ICICI bank, its joint venture partner, to receive regulatory approval before launching its service in India.First Eastern estimates that there are 1.9bn mobile phone users in Asia Pacific, few of whom have access to mobile phone banking.

The acquisition of the US natural gas producer includes about $10bn in XTO debt and is the eighth-largest energy deal since records began, according to Thomson Reuters. While XTO shares rose 15.4 per cent to $47.86, Exxon lost 4.3 per cent to $69.69.The S&P 500 closed at its highest level since October last year, climbing 0.7 per cent to 1,114.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,501.05 and the Nasdaq added 1 per cent to 2,212.10.However, Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said investors were still cautious and focusing on the upcoming FOMC meeting this week. “The Fed is not going to raise rates but in their communiqué they will probably be less dovish than they have been. They may need to raise interest rates sooner, rather than later.”Citigroup weighed on the market after announcing it would issue $17.5bn in common stock and $3.5bn in tangible equity units in a move to repay government bail-out funds.The deal will end the loss-sharing agreement between Citi and the US government, putting an end to the pay restrictions that had accompanied the funds.In a similar move, Bank of America sold $18.3bn of shares earlier this month to exit the troubled asset relief programme.Citigroup was down 6.3 per cent at $3.70. After early losses, the financial sector closed 0.6 per cent higher.Elsewhere, Visa rose 4.2 per cent to $84.77 after the stock was raised from “neutral” to “outperform” at Robert W. Baird & Co. Shares in the world’s largest electronic payments network were also buoyed by the company’s impending inclusion in the S&P 500 index.Visa, which has risen more than 60 per cent so far this year, will replace Ciena, the network communications company. Ciena shares fell 4.4 per cent to $10.99 on Monday.MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, will also be dropped from the index and its shares dropped 7.6 per cent at $3.39.In other deal news, shares of Sun Microsystems jumped 11 per cent to $9.28 after EU regulators said they were optimistic a “satisfactory outcome” over Oracle‘s takeover bid was possible. The $7bn takeover deal has been under scrutiny due to competition concerns.The European Commission has until January 27 to clear or block the bid. However, last month, Steve Mills, head of IBM’s software division and one of Oracle’s biggest rivals, told the Financial Times that the acquisition did not raise any significant antitrust issues and was likely to close soon. Oracle shares gained 2.3 per cent to $23.31.Luna Innovations, which makes technology for medical, telecoms, energy and defence companies, soared 61.9 per cent to $2.38 after the group submitted a reorganisation plan to emerge from bankruptcy. The company also settled all claims with Hansen Medical, the medical robotics group.Luna shares had plummeted earlier this year after the company was ordered to pay Hansen about $36m after allegedly misappropriating trade secrets belonging to its rival.Hansen shares also gained 8.6 per cent to $2.90 following the announcement.Terra Industries dropped 2 per cent to $34.58 after the fertiliser producer rejected a $3.9bn takeover bid from rival fertiliser maker CF Industries Holdings.CF boosted its bid earlier this month but Terra said the deal still undervalued the company. Shares in CF, which has itself been trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid by Agrium, fell 0.3 per cent to $89.75.Shares in Amazon.com fell 2.1 per cent to $131.38 after Barron’s said market expectations for the online retailer may be too high as the stock has more than doubled this year.

For example, Clear2Pay said it helped Wells Fargo cut time taken on its cash transfers out of the US from three days to a few minutes.The deal with Aquiline will give the US private equity group joint control of Clear2Pay with its management, as the two will together own more than 50 per cent.The €50m of new capital is designed to fund the company’s growth and strategic acquisitions until a planned initial public offering in a few years’ time.“We wanted to find a US investor, as that is an important market for us in the future,” said Jurgen Ingels, co-founder and chief financial officer of Clear2Pay.He said the company aimed to generate half its revenues in the US, up from 15 per cent currently.Clear2Pay, which is based in Brussels, employs 450 staff, has grown at 25 per cent annually and is expected to earn €55m of revenues and €4m of profits next year.Aquiline was founded in 2005 by Jeff Greenberg soon after he quit as chief executive and chairman of Marsh & McLennan, the world’s biggest insurance broker.It raised a $1.1bn fund in 2006 and its investments include Ark, the Lloyd’s insurer and BinckBank, the Dutch internet bank.
424;V;Visa Inc;2009-12-07T00:43:55Z;Politics hinders relationship with EU;;Disappointment runs high in Tirana over Albania’s exclusion from the European Union’s new visa-free travel arrangements for the west Balkans. Visa liberalisation, effective from December 19, means that citizens of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro – but not Albania or Bosnia Herzegovina – will be able to go on business trips at short notice or spend the Christmas and New Year holidays with relatives within the EU’s Schengen area.“It’s a shame we didn’t make it,” says Ylli, a businessman working on a project with foreign investors. “I’m always worried that my visa application will be turned down and I’ll miss an important meeting.”The government still hopes to meet all the European Commission benchmarks on passport controls, border security and combating organised crime in time for visa restrictions to be lifted next summer. “We’ve met almost all the technical requirements of the visa roadmap, what remain are “open” benchmarks that have to do with the quality of operations,” says Ilir Meta, deputy prime minister and foreign minister.With about 1m Albanians – almost one-third of the population – living in Greece, Italy and other EU member states, freedom of movement is seen as critical to the country’s development. Albania is also hoping to pass another milestone next year: becoming a formal candidate for EU membership.The right-of-centre government of Sali Berisha, prime minister, submitted an official application last April, just as Albania was celebrating its entry to Nato, together with neighbouring Croatia.Now, bureaucrats in Tirana, the capital, are bracing for the arrival of a questionnaire from Brussels containing more than 2,200 queries to be answered within a three-month period. The commission is expected to issue its opinion on candidacy in the second half of next year. “It’s going to be a demanding process. We’ll reply to the questions, further clarifications may be needed, but we’re optimistic we’ll get official candidate status,” Mr Meta says. Getting a starting date for accession talks is quite another matter, he acknowledges. “It’s better not to focus on a date, but just do our homework,” Mr Meta says.Deepening the European integration process is a priority for Mr Berisha’s government during its second term in office. But its commitment to western democratic standards is being questioned by the opposition Socialists led by Edi Rama, mayor of Tirana, following a closely-fought national election last June. Mr Berisha’s Democratic party finished ahead in the poll, but the Socialists refuse to accept the result without a partial recount of ballots from constituencies in three cities where they claim irregularities took place – a request the government refuses to back.A report by international observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe said vote-counting “was assessed as bad or very bad at 22 of the 66 ballot counting centres … As the count progressed, political parties started interfering more actively, especially where results were or appeared to be close”.The Democrats won 68 seats outright but, thanks to an alliance with Mr Meta’s Socialist Movement for Integration and support from two small parties, they control 75 out of 140 seats in parliament. The 64 Socialist deputies refuse to take their seats in the chamber until the ballot box dispute is resolved. “How can we make progress towards European integration if we’re not able to carry out a European-standard election?” says Mr Rama.The stand-off has not affected the day-to-day work of parliament. But, if continued, it would prevent the passage of legislation requiring a qualified majority of 84 deputies – including changes to the penal code which are important for strengthening the rule of law.The country’s divisive politics has a knock-on effect both on society and the economy. Jobs in the public sector still depend as much on political affiliations as on qualifications. Although bureaucratic obstacles to entering the market are diminishing, vested interest groups with strong political ties are able to squeeze out rivals.In spite of recent high growth rates, averaging 6 per cent a year until this year, unemployment stands at around 12 per cent of the workforce – a figure that fails to take into account the jobless rate in the countryside where the population is assumed to be employed in subsistence farming. Few positions are available for an increasing number of well-qualified Albanians who have worked in west European capitals and the US but would like to make a career at home.“Albania needs expertise, but it’s discouraging to come back and find that sectors like professional services are tainted by politics and corrupt practices,” says Edmond, an IT specialist who trained in Germany. Yet Mr Berisha’s government welcomes foreign investors. His “one-euro” policy of offering state-owned land on long leases for a nominal rent attracts manufacturing companies that take advantage of low labour costs and the proximity of markets in Italy.According to the World Economic Forum’s latest competitiveness report, Albania scored higher than many of its neighbours on wage flexibility, investor protection and legal rights, and also required fewer procedures for starting up a business.A Chinese delegation recently made the first high-level visit since ties with Albania’s Stalinist regime were broken in the mid-1980s. It focused on securing raw materials – chrome and copper – as well as the potential for building container terminals at ports on the Adriatic coast.Albania’s assets include sizeable hydro-power capacity, built under communism, that is being upgraded and expanded by Austrian, Italian and Norwegian companies seeking to extend their renewables portfolios. Dritan Prifti, the energy minister, says that, with up to €4bn ($6bn) of foreign investment committed to energy projects, the country is on the way to becoming an electricity exporter.Chronic power shortages have eased with the recent addition of generating capacity, investment in upgrading the national grid and the privatisation of the state-owned electricity distributor. But the road network still needs substantial investment. Sections of the main highway south to Greece remain potholed while the government considers proposals for a toll road project. A showcase public works project, a 61km stretch of new highway through mountainous north-east Albania, aimed at halving the travel time between Tirana and Pristina, the Kosovo capital, has faced delays and cost overruns.For would-be investors outside the “one-euro” districts, the issue of land purchases and permits looms large. The World Bank’s latest “Doing Business” report ranked Albania 173rd out of 186 countries in the handling of construction permits. While a new land registry operates in Tirana, disputes continue over property ownership and the authenticity of title deeds in areas where land values have soared.As a result, the spectacular southern coastline still lacks a high-quality international resort that would define standards for local developers, and allow Albania to compete with neighbouring Montenegro as an emerging tourist destination.
425;V;Visa Inc;2009-11-30T09:28:52Z;Interchange fees;;The way retailers pay banks when customers spend on plastic is peculiar. Fees are split: the processing bank takes some, with the bulk going to the bank that issued the card. The large networks – Visa and MasterCard, which handle almost three-quarters of US card purchases – do not make revenues from so-called interchange directly. They instead charge banks individually negotiated licence and processing fees. But it is the networks that set the interchange fee, typically between 1.5 and 2 per cent of a transaction’s value.Enter the Government Accountability Office which, at the urging of politicians, has cast an eye over the US market. Overall fees have risen – which the networks attribute to increased card usage. Retailers, meanwhile, argue that the rise reflects the networks’ pricing power and the growth of higher-fee payment methods, such as reward cards. The GAO, at least, has found signs of rising credit card fee levels and more complex pricing structures, although this may overlook the growth of lower-fee debit payments.This is a market with something for everyone, though. Consumers enjoy convenience and lower-cost cards, while retailers gain from increased customer spending and lower processing costs. However, the networks are setting a price that they neither pay nor keep as revenues. And the GAO acknowledges that more competition between networks may actually have increased prices as networks fought over affluent cardholders. Interchange, after all, forms part of networks’ marketing when persuading banks to issue their cards. Higher fees for card issuers means more money to win cardholders and develop products.There seems little basis for intervention here, even with Congress in a mood to meddle. Moreover, international evidence suggests that shoppers do not necessarily benefit from caps on fees. Indeed, they may suffer as banks’ interest rates rise to compensate. Interchange should be a long way down regulatory to-do lists.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
426;V;Visa Inc;2009-11-04T16:29:54Z;Capital markets: Strong growth after slight dip;;From the perspective of Brazil’s capital markets, it is almost as if the global financial crisis never happened. The country’s main equity index has gained more than 140 per cent in dollar terms this year. Both stocks and the currency are back to their levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Brazil has been a great story,” says Alvise Marino of IDEAglobal, a New York research firm. “It may have slower growth than China, but it’s a lot easier to invest in.”Such has been the pace of recovery since the downturn at the end of last year that some have started talking about a bubble. Most analysts think it is too soon to say, but the government is taking no chances.Last month, it imposed a 2 per cent tax on foreign investments in equities and fixed income instruments. Guido Mantega, finance minister, said the tax was designed to slow the exaggerated appreciation of the real, which had gained 36 per cent against the US dollar this year before the tax was introduced.The move is unlikely to have much impact on the long-term movement of stock prices or the exchange rate. But it could reduce volatility, limiting the impact of an increase in Brazilian interest rates, for example, widely expected during the first half of next year.Modern financial engineering should have little trouble sidestepping the tax. Derivatives that deliver earnings on Brazilian assets without bringing money to Brazil can be bought for about 0.5 per cent more than buying the underlying assets – much better than 2 per cent.But one area where the tax is likely to bite is among investors in equities traded both at home and overseas. Many of Brazil’s biggest companies have shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange as American Depository Receipts, which have suddenly become more attractive.“We are under friendly fire,” says Edemir Pinto, chief executive of the BM&FBovespa, the multi-asset exchange formed by the merger of the São Paulo futures and stock exchanges.The BM&FBovespa has been working hard over the past two years to attract business from other exchanges. In terms of market capitalisation, it is already the fourth largest exchange in the world, bigger than NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX combined. It has invested heavily to facilitate direct market access – or DMA, by which big traders execute trades directly on the exchange rather than through brokers – and co-location, in which big customers may install servers inside the exchange’s premises.Brazil is also seeing a surge of algorithmic trading facilitated by “complex event processing” or CEP platforms. Software companies such as Progress Apama and StreamBase, both of the US, have sold systems to at least 15 customers in São Paulo.These platforms, which quickly became standard instruments in the US and European markets over the past couple of years, help find arbitrage opportunities between assets traded in Brazil and overseas and increase the speed and therefore competitiveness with which operators can identify and execute trades.Such advances have helped create deep and liquid markets in São Paulo, encouraging some companies to issue shares even during the crisis. In June, VisaNet, the Brazilian arm of Visa, the credit card network, raised $4.3bn, in what was Brazil’s biggest initial public offering. It was topped last month when Santander, the Spanish bank, sold 14 per cent of its Brazilian operation for $8.1bn.Abundant liquidity in São Paulo was a boon to investors during the early stages of the global crisis, enabling them to withdraw funds needed to cover losses elsewhere. It has been an important factor in attracting their return.The government’s 2 per cent tax threatens to reduce liquidity, undoing much of the BM&FBovespa’s good work, Mr Pinto says. “We didn’t need to have suffered this,” he says. “Our market was one of the first in the world to recover this year and we had the promise of more IPOs this year and spectacular growth in the first half of next year. We didn’t expect such a drastic measure.”Nevertheless, the exchange continues to work on attracting foreign business. It will soon open an office in London, adding to its presence in Shanghai and New York.Before last year’s merger, the BM&F reached an order routing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange so traders on either exchange can access products on the other. Last month the BM&FBovespa said it was discussing a similar deal on the equities side with Nasdaq OMX.

The index has given up 5 per cent from a 2009 high reached on October 19.The S&P 500, which bottomed in early March, remains per 15.4 cent higher for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday fell 1.2 per cent to 9,762.69. The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.7 per cent lower at 2059.61.Investors have lately been leery of buying into signs of a stronger economy, said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“Early on it was a reluctance to believe in the recovery,” he said. “As people become more convinced about the recovery, they really remain concerned about how far the markets have moved.”Third-quarter corporate earnings announcements on Wednesday sent mixed messages on the economic recovery.Among the stocks most punished was Goodyear, the tyremaker, whose revenues declined 15 per cent in the quarter. It dropped 19.6 per cent to $13.46 as the group indicated that its North American business faced struggles.International Paper declined 3.5 per cent to $21.83 after telling investors that seasonally weak demand would render “significantly lower” results in the final quarter of the year from the past quarter.A report that sales of new houses in the US fell a surprise 3.6 per cent in September also damped market sentiment. Shares of Lennar, a builder, fell 7.5 per cent to $12.63.Energy stocks felt pressure. US coal miner Massey Energy sank 8.5 per cent to $28.66 as weak demand from power plants triggered a profit drop. Rival Peabody Energy was 6 per cent lower at $39.64.ConocoPhillips, the first big US oil producer to report results this week, was down 2.8 per cent at $49.49 after announcing a 71 per cent drop in profit to $1.5bn, or $1 a share.A steep decline in crude futures on Wednesday also dented its shares.Financial stocks sputtered. Insurer Genworth Financial fell 7.6 per cent to $8.69 while insurer MBIA fell 8.2 per cent to $4.02.Meanwhile, card payment processor Visa rose 3.6 per cent to $76.57 after beating profit forecasts and indicating that consumer spending could be firming up.The Commerce Department reported orders for long-lived goods from US manufacturers rose 1 per cent last month, marking a reversal from a decline in August.“Through the month-to-month volatility, the improvement in manufacturing activity is evident across a large number of reports, and this is another one that fits into that picture,” analysts at RDQ Economics wrote in a note.Yet industrial stocks did not reflect optimism. US Steel fell 5 per cent to $35.53 after its quarterly loss announced this week was followed by disappointing results at ArcelorMittal, the largest steelmaker. Aluminium group Alcoa fell 6.9 per cent to $11.93.Norfolk Southern, the fourth-largest US rail transporter, rose 0.4 per cent to $46.25 after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings late on Tuesday. Rail company Union Pacific rose 0.7 per cent to $55.45.Among the handful of initial public offerings this week, Vitamin Shoppe, a US health supplement retailer, which was priced at $17 a share, ended its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a bang at $17.95 a share.Addus HomeCare, which provides home health care, traded 15.1 per cent below its initial offer price of $10 a share.Telecoms gained. Qwest Communications rose 2.6 per cent to $3.54 after beating profit forecasts and pledging new cost cuts.Verizon Communications closed 2.6 per cent higher at $29.95 a share.Newspaper companies were trailing after reporting dismal circulation trends this week.Gannett, the largest US publisher, fell 10.1 per cent to $10.40 a share. New York Times dropped 11.8 per cent to $8.56.
428;V;Visa Inc;2009-10-23T16:39:26Z;Provident to reap rewards of cautious lending;;A cautious approach to lending by Provident Financial, one of the few subprime lenders still active in the market, should help the company deliver profitable growth this year.Provident, which lends small sums to borrowers with patchy credit records, has reported a strong performance in its home collections business and “very satisfactory” demand from new customers at its Vanquis Bank credit card business between July and October.The lender said it had deliberately slowed the rate of new customer growth in its home collections business by being more selective with new customers and tightening criteria for existing customers.The division, which generates 85 per cent of the company’s revenue, increased customer numbers by 4 per cent in the four months to October compared with the same period last year.Vanquis, which offers Visa credit cards to people who are ordinarily rejected by mainstream lenders, is only accepting 17 per cent of card applications, compared with closer to 30 per cent two years ago.Provident closed 21,000 inactive accounts over the summer to reduce the risk of undrawn credit lines turning sour.Peter Crook, chief executive, said arrears on loans had stabilised in each of the businesses. In its home collected business arrears were about 31 per cent of revenue.“We have maintained a consistently cautious approach to both new lending and balance sheet funding throughout the economic downturn,” said Mr Crook.Provident has increased its market share in the past year as other subprime lenders such as London Scottish Bank and Cattles have quit the market or rapidly wound down lending.Provident said household incomes were coming under pressure due to rising unemployment. It did not expect any material improvement in the rate of unemployment until next spring.Mr Crook expects profits to rise in the coming months as the company enters its peak trading time.“We don’t think our customers will cancel Christmas,” he said. “However demand for credit is a bit weaker as people are avoiding taking on more commitments as they are fearful about whether they will still be in work next year.”Provident has recently improved its capital base. It launched a £250m bond issue, with an 8 per cent coupon and also redeemed £94m of its £100m in subordinated 2010 bonds. The shares fell 9p to 951p.
429;V;Visa Inc;2009-10-22T22:22:14Z;Game-plan to beat recession;;At last week’s National Football League owners meeting in Boston, one of the regular gatherings of the high-powered executives who run the league and its 32 teams, the agenda included adding games to the schedule, whether to include sponsors’ logos on practice kit and plans for a new collective bargaining agreement with players.But underlying all this, the mood was bullish. One of the biggest businesses in sport, announced Roger Goodell, league commissioner, was bucking the economic recession.“We started the session this morning as we traditionally do with a report on the status of the season, and we had a very upbeat report, not only on the quality of the games but also with fan engagement,” he says.Ratings for all four of the networks that televise NFL games – CBS, NBC, Fox and ESPN – have increased from last year, and the viewership records have been set in three of this season’s first five weeks, with the most watched Sunday night game ever on September 20 between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys on NBC.The league has also in the past few months showed it is surviving a weak sponsorship market by signing a new deal with Proctor & Gamble, while renewing long-standing agreements with Visa and IBM.But as the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers get set to play each other at London’s Wembley Stadium on Sunday, the third regular season game to be played there in as many years, Mr Goodell appears convinced that the health of the sport will benefit from global expansion.“The progress we are making internationally, in particular our efforts in the UK, show that the fans have really responded,” he says. “The fans in the UK look like they could have a second game, and we are looking as early as next year. It could be Wembley, or it could also be some place else in the UK, and we have talked about other spots in Europe also.”Steve Tisch, owner of the New York Giants, a team that played in the inaugural London game two years ago, is an enthusiastic supporter of the commissioner’s strategy. “The way Roger has set it up with the London games is a great start, and the experiences over there have been terrific.”For a domestic league with revenues of $8bn (€5.3bn, £4.8bn) that culminates in the Super Bowl, one of the marketing world’s marquee events – in the midst of the global recession, 30-second ads for last February’s game cost an average of $3m, up from $2.7m the year before – it is perhaps a surprising strategy.What is more, previous efforts to expand the sport abroad have been unsuccessful. NFL Europa, a Europe-based branch of the league which included teams in Germany and the Netherlands, closed in 2007, and the NFL turned instead to the current strategy of playing regular season games outside the US.Still, Mr Goodell points to the more than 140m NFL fans outside the US and 120 broadcasters from 230 countries and territories that will carry NFL programming in 2009 as evidence of its continuing global appeal.But he also recognises that “we are not played as broadly as some other sports, particularly soccer and basketball, but when people have the opportunity to see our game and be engaged, they love it and want more of it”.In this respect, the National Basketball Association, another North American league that has pursued an international strategy in recent years, has been more successful. The sport is well established in Europe and, perhaps more significantly for the long term, in China. Last year, the league formed NBA China, an organisation designed to conduct all its operations there and it claims that NBA.com/china, its local website, is the single most popular sports website in the country.For the time being, the NFL remains focused on expanding the business in Europe, but for the fans set to turn the home of English football into a home for its American version, the only numbers that count will be on the scoreboard.
430;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Regulation: Reasons to be cheerful about cross-border payments;;The euro gave much of Europe a single currency. So the idea that payments across borders should be as easy as those made domestically would seem a natural corollary. Unfortunately, life is rarely straightforward. As most travellers in Europe know, debit cards issued in one country are not always welcomed in another.Trying to arrange to pay regular bills from an account in a different country can be anything from difficult to impossible. The question is, will this situation improve?There are some reasons to be optimistic. The European Union’s Payment Service Directive, passed in 2007 after some controversy, needs to be implemented in all member states by next month.This piece of legislation seeks to do two things. First, it aims to create a harmonised legal framework to support an integrated payments market so that cross-border credit and debit transfers become smoother and cheaper.Second, it creates a “payment institution” licence for non-bank payment service providers, with passporting rights allowing them to operate across the EU. To gain such authorisation, institutions must meet capital and governance requirements – and anyone who does not hold a PI is barred from providing payment services unless they are either a “PI agent” or a “waived PI”.PI agents – which can range from petrol stations to pharmacies – are independent third parties that can be used by PIs, but for which PIs are fully responsible. Countries can waive authorisation and capital requirements for “small” PIs, but there will be strict limits on how much business these “waived PIs” can do.As so often with EU directives, not all member states will be ready by the implementation deadline: half-a-dozen countries are thought likely to miss the November date. Some of the detailed measures in the directive are also only due to be phased in over the following months and years.But even if progress is rather uneven, some service providers are already claiming that the new PSD framework could offer consumers big benefits, particularly in terms of access to convenient payment facilities. “There will be huge consequences for consumers,” says AJ Hanna, senior vice-president at Western Union Financial Services, for example, which plans to add 15,000 new payment outlets in about eight EU countries and Switzerland over the coming years through agreements with Lagardere Services, Ortel Finance and PayUp. “Retail networks can now offer simple payment services.”The harmonised legal framework established by the Payment Services Directive is also laying the foundation for another European payments project: the so-called Single Euro Payment Area, or Sepa.Sepa is a private-sector initiative, developed by Europe’s banks but heavily backed by both the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Its core concept is that electronic payments made across the euro area – whether by bank transfer, direct debit, credit or debit card – should become as straightforward as domestic payments, thanks to the adoption of common processing standards and systems.Sepa was formally launched in respect of credit transfers almost two years ago – in January 2008 – and direct debit changes, after some slippage, were scheduled to come on stream next month.But from the start, the devil has been in the detail. From the outset, Sepa was never entirely comprehensive. Back in early-2008, about 4,000 banks had signed up – or about 50 per cent of the banks in the region, although they did speak for a larger proportion of transactions, estimated at about 80 per cent.More seriously, perhaps, by July 2009, only 4.4 per cent of all credit transfers were using Sepa standards, prompting EU officials to acknowledge that, while the banking industry had drawn up the appropriate rulebooks, migration to the new standards was “lagging”.Explanations for that slow progress are various. Some say that the entire project has suffered from being driven more by political objectives than market demand. Others put the blame on uncertainties stemming from EU competition policy.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, warned at the beginning that Sepa should not be used by banks as an excuse to raise prices. One of her main concerns was that banks operating national card schemes could be sucked into more expensive international networks, because of a desire to provide consumers with pan-European functionality.There are two services that can cover all 32 Sepa countries (the EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Monaco and Switzerland) – Visa and Mastercard. But they have been in dispute with Ms Kroes over whether their charging structures for cross-border transactions were anti-competitive because they unjustifiably inflated the cost of card acceptance by retailers.The Mastercard situation has been largely resolved (although the card company is still appealing to the European courts over principles at stake). Matters at Visa are less clear.This uncertainty has been seized on by some banks. The French National Sepa committee, for example, announced a one-year delay in implementing Sepa direct debits last May, saying these would come in only by November 2010, not 2009.It gave two reasons: a delay in passing the national law to meet the Payment Service Directive, and “the need for further investigation and clarification of the economics of the new interchange fee levies”.One big question now is whether EU officials will set deadlines for moving credit transfers and direct debits to the Sepa systems. Charlie McCreevy, EU internal market commissioner, has acknowledged that this would provide certainty, and incentivise migration. A public consultation launched by the commission also showed that a large majority was broadly in support. The commission has said it will discuss the matter with member states before taking a decision.
431;V;Visa Inc;2009-10-13T15:37:50Z;Mobile payments: phones as wallets gain critical mass;;"The idea of using a mobile phone to pay for goods and services is gaining a critical mass as people move to smarter handsets and use them in increasingly sophisticated ways.Extra momentum is supplied by companies from Microsoft to MasterCard who are piling in with mobile money initiatives.Several mobile financial services are already available – banking, app store transactions, topping up phone credits, and paying for parking among them – but the big prize is the retail market. Visa, for example, says that face-to-face transactions form 90 per cent of its business in Europe, making mobile point-of-sale services an obvious and potentially lucrative extension of its model.“The mobile phone will eventually replace plastic,” says Dan Salmons, director of payment innovations at Barclaycard, the UK-based payment business of Barclays Group. “By 2012 it will be normal to pay with the phone, and in five to 10 years, it is completely reasonable to think plastic will be relegated to a secondary function.”Cash could be replaced, too, by services aimed at using mobile devices for small purchases.Parts of the world are forging ahead or carrying out trials: in Japan, 30m mobile subscribers already use a payment system called Mobile FeliCa, based on Sony technology and developed by NTT DoCoMo. In Europe, O2 worked with Visa and Barclaycard on a trial in 2007 and 2008 in which 500 people used their phones instead of Oyster cards on transport systems and in place of credit cards in participating retailers.In Austria, Mobilkom operates the second-largest non-cash payment service in the country, after the Maestro card. And Orange has committed itself to rolling out widescale mobile payment services in several markets, including a pan-operator service in France and an exclusive deal with Barclaycard in the UK.All of these projects are for point-of-sale transactions and rely, at least in part, on near-field communications technology: a chip provides a radio signal that acts as a secure bridge between a phone and a payment terminal at a retailer. The handset is waved in front of a machine to make the system work.Typically, transactions should take no more than half a second, says Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile for Visa Europe.But some experts are wondering which way the market will go. NFC chips can also be embedded in traditional cards, and a recent survey from Gartner revealed that consumers ranked mobile payments as one of the least interesting functions that they would want on a phone. They preferred things such as location-based services.“It’s a niche that doesn’t really seem to interest consumers,” says Nick Jones, a vice president at Gartner Research.There is also technical and organisational complexity to be faced. Alastair Lukies, chief executive of mobile banking provider Monitise, says: “You need interoperability across the whole supply chain, but frankly the mobile chain is one of the most complex I’ve ever seen.”On top of a sizable investment in software, the NFC route also requires investment in chips in handsets and special readers at the point of sale. To date, only one large manufacturer, Nokia, has been rolling out NFC-enabled phones; others have scaled back plans.Meanwhile, companies such as Accells and Neomedia claim to offer “NFC-like” services, with Accells using radio technology present in most handsets and Neomedia taking a barcode-reading approach.“In the last 15 years there have been many new instruments and technologies developed for electronic payments, but just a handful of them have actually been deployed,” notes Jan Manten, chief executive of payments provider GlobalCollect.In some smaller markets, successful mobile money initiatives have been implemented already. Mobilkom has made €50m in mobile payment revenues so far in 2009, a growth of more than 30 per cent on the year before. Hannes Ametsreiter, group chief executive of Telekom Austria, says the services have been “very profitable”.The operator offers various payment options from the use of codes, through NFC in handsets where available, to a credit card launched with Visa, called the A1, which allows customers to earn points which can be redeemed against the purchase of new devices and other mobile items. When a transaction is made, users also automatically receive texts of the details to ensure the card number is not getting used without their knowledge.Operators in bigger markets admit they cannot manage m-payments schemes on their own. “Mobile operators are not banks,” says Mung Ki Woo, VP overseeing mobile payments at Orange.Instead, they are seeking gradual approaches into financial services. O2 Money, launched with Visa, is a pre-paid card service: cash is transferred on to the card, which is then used like a credit or debit card. Again, users receive texts detailing transactions.MasterCard, the credit card company, has been rolling out MoneySend, currently available in 19 markets, to enable mobile money transfers; and PayPal and Western Union are active in the mobile money transfer area.The numbers for mobile banking remain small, however: 25.6m people worldwide have used some form of mobile banking at least once, according to ABI Research.Similarly, NFC services are being held back by the retail side. A number of businesses have only just made investments in chip-and-pin terminals, and some analysts say that in the current climate another upgrade could prove to be a hard sell.Payment providers claim there is steady progress in this area, led by larger retailers that focus on heavy footfall in peak times, such as sandwich and coffee shops. “Key brands are rolling out contactless in their networks, and we are in advanced conversations with other well known brands,” says Mr Salmons of Barclaycard.One selling point has been the promise of more innovative reward and loyalty schemes for customers using the mobile channel rather than the highly encrypted financial network.At the same time, retailers are experimenting with alternative methods. In September Starbucks launched an iPhone application that lets customers purchase their lattes and muffins with the click of a button. Using technology from a start-up called Billing Revolution, credit card details are entered once and can then be used for all purchases, including those with other merchants: Billing Revolution claims that a partnership with Authorize.net has now plugged 200,000 retailers into its network."

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq slipped a faraction lower to 2,139.14. The Dow closed 0.2 per cent higher at 9,885.80 and touched a new intra-day high for the year.Among stocks in the spotlight, Black & Decker jumped 7.6 per cent to $50.82 after the company raised its third-quarter outlook, thanks to better sales and a weaker dollar. Barclays began coverage of the company with an Overweight rating and a price target of $55.In deal activity, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, agreed to buy Proteolix, a private company, for up to $810m. Shares in Onyx rose 5.1 per cent to $28.26.The third quarter earnings season starts in earnest this week and leading companies due with results include Intel and Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday; JPMorgan on Wednesday; while on Thursday, Goldman Sachs, Google, Merck, IBM, Citi, and Advanced Micro Devices report. The week is rounded off with earnings from Bank of America, General Electric, Halliburton and Mattel.ThomsonReuters estimates the earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies for the third quarter at minus 24.6 per cent. The estimated rate has been revised lower from 2.6 per cent at the start of the year, then minus 17.2 per cent at the beginning of April, and minus 20.9 per cent at the start of July.“The Financials sector (+58 per cent) is anticipating the highest earnings growth rate for the quarter, while the materials (-65 per cent), energy (-65 per cent), and industrials (-45 per cent) sectors are expecting the lowest,” say analysts at ThomsonReuters.While a negative quarter would extend Corporate America’s current run to nine consecutive quarterly profit declines, much attention will focus on an expected rebound in earnings next year.As a result, guidance from companies looms as being the key driver of sentiment for equities.“The most critical news is likely to be centred on initial guidance to next year’s business activity and its impact on the bottom line,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“With Street consensus bottom-up earnings growth projected to climb 26 per cent to 27 per cent year over year in 2010, there is not that much room for conservative outlook statements which may be deemed disappointing,” said Mr Levkovich.ThomsonReuters estimates earnings growth rates for the S&P 500 of 192 per cent for the fourth quarter, which benefits from an easy comparison with the fourth quarter of 2008. That is followed by a 34 per cent rise in earnings for the first quarter of 2010.The positive start for equities on Monday was also a function of various brokerage upgrades.Shares in MasterCard rose 0.7 per cent to $216, and Visa gained 1 per cent to $73.70, after they were upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” by Credit Suisse. The bank’s price target for MasterCard was raised from $210 to $255, while Visa was increased from $70 to $84.“An improvement in spending volumes should translate into improving revenue growth in the coming quarters which will increase investor confidence in a higher long term earnings growth rate,” said the bank. “Moreover, the secular shift from cash to plastic continues.”Over at UBS, shares in Advanced Micro Deviceswere raised from “neutral” to “buy” and th chipmaker closed up 0.4 per cent at $29.85.UBS also upgraded Amgen to a “buy” from a “neutral” rating. The stock rose 0.2 per cent to $59.51. Shares in Infosys dropped 0.8 per cent to $47.37 and pared an early rise after Wells Fargo upgraded the company. Abercrombie & Fitch rallied 2.3 per cent to $35.63 after the retailer was upgraded to a “buy”, while Occidental Petroleum rose 1 per cent to $80.31, in spite of being reduced from “buy” to “hold” by Citigroup. The bank lowered the target price for Oxy from $82 to $74.Meanwhile, KB Homes dropped 7.8 per cent to $15.17, after the home builder said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating possible accounting and disclosure issues.Shares in Google were up 1.7 per cent at $525.02.

433;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
434;V;Visa Inc;2009-10-07T18:14:15Z;Short View: Booming Brazil;;The international community has a strong tendency to misjudge Brazil. Seven years ago, international investors fled in fear at the election of the leftwinger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president. They created the buying opportunity of a lifetime. Since then, in dollar terms, Brazil’s Bovespa has gained some 1,100 per cent more than the S&P 500.In April last year, Standard & Poor’s elevated Brazil’s sovereign credit to investment grade – and almost perfectly called the top before a calamitous collapse.As the crisis took hold last year, international agencies worried that Brazil could face a classic emerging-market crisis, with a collapsing currency leading to default. Since last November, the Bovespa has gained 180 per cent.Last week, the International Olympic Committee awarded the 2016 games to Rio de Janeiro. Lula now apparently has even greater persuasive powers than Barack Obama. On Wednesday, Brazil also hosted the biggest initial public offering in the world this year, valuing Banco Santander’s Brazilian business at more than any other since Visa’s March 2008 offering.Are investors right this time?Possibly. The Bovespa’s price to book value ratio of just over 2 is almost identical to that of emerging markets as a whole, and has risen in line with other emerging markets – last time around, the Bovespa at one point traded at a book multiple of 2.5, and was far ahead of other emerging markets. Its ability to weather last year’s outflow of funds was valid evidence that it is on a stronger financial footing than many had believed.But a rise of 180 per cent in less than a year still shows overheating. Brazil remains a proxy for the world’s hopes in “decoupling” – that emerging markets can grow even if developed markets are in recession. The fervour suggests such hopes are too high again.john.authers@ft.comwww.ft.com/shortviewForum: Discuss John Authers’ Short View

Gamblers are now allowed to visit once a month compared with once every three months previously.Wynn’s IPO is being arranged by JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS.Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands is planning a Hong Kong listing of its Macao business this year.Just less than 13 per cent of Wynn’s IPO has been reserved for four tycoons from Hong Kong and Malaysia – Walter Kwok, Thomas Lau, Quek Leng Chan and Chua Ma Yu.Mr Wynn has said the IPO will make his group “more of a Chinese company”, although it will retain just $5m of the Hong Kong IPO proceeds for “general corporate purposes” in Macao.Wynn shares are due to begin trading on October 9.

The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $69.47, pushing it up 1.5 per cent this week.Constellation Energy beat estimates and raised its earnings forecast for the full year. The power company’s shares dropped 1.1 per cent to $28.70.Also exceeding its forecasts, Dominion Resources recorded a 52 per cent rise in net income but cut its outlook. The stock fell 2.1 per cent to $33.80.After the closing bell on Thursday, Walt Disney reported a 26 per cent slide in third quarter earnings. The stock slid 4.2 per cent to $25.12 and analysts at JP Morgan downgraded Disney on Friday.The S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to close at 987.48, having risen 0.7 per cent to a high of 993.18 earlier. That left the benchmark up 0.8 per cent for the week, and 7.4 per cent higher for July.The Nasdaq Composite slipped in late trade on Friday, closing down 0.3 per cent at 1,978.50, for a weekly climb of 0.6 per cent and a monthly rise of 7.8 per cent.Both the S&P and Nasdaq have rallied for each of the past five months and this week the main benchmarks set highs for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2 per cent higher at 9,171.61 on Friday, a gain of 0.9 per cent this week. For July, blue chips jumped 8.6 per cent, the best month since a rise of 10.6 per cent in October 2002.The rise in shares on Friday came after the advance read on US gross domestic product for the second quarter showed a contraction of 1 per cent. That was better than the forecast decline of 1.5 per cent.Economists said this indicated that the recession was abating, clearing the way for a modest expansion during the third quarter.That outlook has powered the equity market’s rally in recent weeks, but some worry that the market is due for a pullback. “There is a lot of money moving off the sidelines into the market, chasing performance,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. “The stock market is getting ahead of itself.”Caution over the economic outlook was provided by the GDP report which showed that consumer spending slipped 1.2 per cent during the second quarter, more than a forecast drop of 0.5 per cent.“With consumers still flat on their backs, it will be a long time before the recovery gains any real momentum,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Meanwhile, downward revisions to past quarters also weighed on sentiment.GDP for the first quarter is now seen to have fallen 6.4 per cent, more than an earlier decline of 5.5 per cent, while fourth quarter GDP is now pegged at a 1.9 per cent decline, versus a prior drop of 0.8 per cent. But investors are banking that companies, which have focused on drastic cost cutting this year, will benefit quickly from a pick-up in the economy.“The reversal of the safe haven trade we have seen on Wall Street for the past three months is set to start playing out on Main Street,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “It’s not just the lean and mean companies, but also those consumers who have saved and delayed buying products. There is a lot of pent-up demand.”From a trading perspective, the S&P 500 has room to rally beyond resistance just above 1,000 and possibly approach 1,100, according to some analysts“The 1,100 area on the S&P marks fair value for the market’s move between 1994 and the top in 2007,” said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “These high-value trading areas are like magnets for the market.”Among stocks in the news this week, shares in Yahoo dropped 18.1 per cent to $14.32 after investors knocked the company’s search engine tie-up with Microsoft.General Electric rose 11.4 per cent to $13.40 this week after it indicated that its finance unit did not need additional capital and Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock.Colgate-Palmolive’s profits beat estimates amid cost cutting, and the group maintained guidance for the rest of the year. The stock fell 3.5 per cent to $72.44 this week.MasterCard rose 4.6 per cent to $194.03 after a 26.4 per cent rise in net income for the second quarter. Visa also beat estimates, but dipped 2.7 per cent to $65.46 this week. Dow Chemical recorded a loss of $486m for the quarter, due to charges stemming from its $16.5bn buy-out of Rohm & Haas and weak sales, but beat estimates and rose 4.9 per cent to $21.17 this week.In deals, IBM said it would buy SPSS, a provider of predictive analytics software for $1.2bn or $50 a share. SPSS rose 41 per cent to $49.48 this week, while Big Blue gained 0.2 per cent to $117.93.
437;V;Visa Inc;2009-07-30T20:48:52Z;S&P 500 flirts with 1,000 level;;US equity benchmarks closed at new highs for the year on Thursday, with investors optimistic that aggressive cost cutting by companies places them in a very profitable position once the economy recovers.In late trade, the S&P 500 had pulled back from testing the 1,000 level, for the first time since last November as traders awaited Friday’s report on gross domestic product for the second quarter.The Nasdaq Composite briefly breached 2,000 for the first time since last October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly rose 9,200, having been below 9,000 just a week ago.A number of earnings results, although mixed, sustained the rally as many companies continue to beat lowered estimates.“With about half of the S&P 500 having already reported, the number of upside surprises is running at a rate not seen since 1994,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “Companies have exceeded bottom-up expectations by about 14.8 per cent with all major sectors beating analyst’s projections.”Concerns that companies are only beating heavily reduced estimates is being downplayed by some analysts, who are focusing on the potential benefits of tough cost cutting.“Aggressive cost cutting in this recession is positioning US companies in an extremely competitive way and a stronger economy later this year will boost revenues and directly into bottom line profits,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan’s Private Bank.The S&P closed 1.2 per cent higher at 986.75, an eight-month peak. All of the 10 main S&P industry sectors rose, led by a 3 per cent gain for materials and a 2.7 per cent rally in financials.After propelling the Nasdaq above 2,000 for the first time since last October, technology stocks pared gains towards the close. The Nasdaq closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,984.30, taking its gain this year to nearly 26 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to close at 9,154.46.After the closing bell Walt Disney reported a 26 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings and in after-hours trade the stock was off 1.5 per cent at $25.5.Shares in General Electric, a Dow component, rallied 6.9 per cent higher to $13.11 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the conglomerate. Blue chips were led higher by Dupont, up 4.3 per cent at $30.81, 3M, firmer by 1.7 per cent at 69.90 and Caterpillar, higher by 3.8 per cent at $43.41.Stronger metal prices helped miners and Alcoa gained 4.1 per cent to finish at $11.46.Dragging on the Dow was Exxon Mobil, whose second-quarter earnings fell 66 per cent to $3.95bn and quarterly revenue dropped 46 per cent to $74.46bn. The stock slipped 1 per cent to $70.72, up from an earlier low of $69.91.Another Dow member reporting yesterday was Travelers, which posted a 21 per cent drop in earnings, below analysts’ forecasts. While the insurer, boosted its 2009 operating earnings outlook, the stock fell 1.6 per cent to $41.94.Elsewhere, Colgate-Palmolive saw its profits beat estimates for the second quarter amid cost cutting.

438;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Higher fees help MasterCard;;MasterCard, the world’s second largest payments network, on Thursday reported higher second-quarter earnings as the company raised the fees it charges banks and cut expenses.Together with rival Visa, which on Wednesday reported strong results for its fiscal third quarter, MasterCard also benefited from a worldwide secular shift away from cash and cheques as consumers turn toward the convenience of electronic payments. This shift has helped both companies weather the effects of a global recession that has reduced overall consumer spending.MasterCard’s second-quarter profits jumped 26.4 per cent year on year to $349m, or $2.67 per diluted share, as the company raised the fees it charges to process transactions.It also cut jobs, and advertising and marketing costs. The cuts contributed to about 30 per cent of the profit increase.Visa on Wednesday reported that net income growth had risen by 72 per cent year on year to $729m, or 97 cents a share.MasterCard and rival Visa have been insulated from the rising credit card losses that have affected banks’ card businesses because the companies process transactions but do not lend to consumers.However, they have had to tackle lower spending as consumers and businesses tighten their belts in the global recession. Spending volumes also contracted as a result of the appreciating US dollar, lower gas prices and slowing cross-border travel.Bob Selander, chief executive of MasterCard, said: “We continue to see the economic downturn affect consumer and business spending.”Both companies reported that overall dollar spending volumes were down, by 9.3 per cent at MasterCard and by 7 per cent at Visa. The contraction was most pronounced in the US, where consumers and businesses spent almost 10 per cent less on their MasterCard-branded credit, debit and charge cards. The number of processed transactions rose in the US and across the globe, however, as consumers increasingly used their cards – instead of cash or cheques – for smaller-ticket purchases.The total number of transactions processed by Visa was 10.3bn in the quarter, an 8 per cent increase year-on-year.At MasterCard, the number of processed transactions grew by 7.9 per cent to 5.6bn.“Spending on big-ticket luxury items is down by up to 20 per cent in some regions. Consumers are spending on things they have to have and not on things they would like to have,” said Mr Selander.He added that the decline in big-ticket purchases had disproportionately affected the use of credit cards.
439;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa boosted by increased reliance on cards;;Visa, the world’s largest electronic payments network, on Wednesday reported higher third-quarter profit as consumers increasingly turned to credit, debit and charge cards to pay for goods and services.Net income grew 73 per cent to $729m, or 97 cents a share, in the three months ending June 30, from $422m, or 51 cents a share a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Excluding the impact from the sale of the company’s stake in VisaNet do Brasil, adjusted quarterly net income was $507m, or 67 cents per share.Visa said consumers spent less during the quarter as the global recession inspired greater thriftiness, resulting in a 7 per cent decline in year-on-year cash volumes to $969bn.However, the number of processed transactions grew as consumers increasingly used their cards in preference to cash or cheques. The total number of processed transactions was 10.3bn in the quarter, an 8 per cent increase year-on-year.Visa and rival Mastercard have been insulated from the rising credit card losses that have affected banks’ card businesses because the companies process transactions but do not lend to consumers. They have also weathered the effects of a global recession that has reduced overall consumer spending because they have benefited from a worldwide shift away from cash and cheques towards the convenience of electronic payments.Total cards carrying the Visa brand rose 6 per cent worldwide over the prior year to 1.7bn.Joe Saunders, chief executive of Visa, said: “With little real improvement in the economic backdrop, Visa still posted solid operational and financial performance results during the fiscal third quarter.”The network said it expected net annual revenue growth of high single digits in 2009 and at the lower end of the 11 per cent to 15 per cent range in 2010, along with annual free cash flow of more than $1bn.Visa’s shares fell 1.74 per cent to $66.78 in after-hours trading. The stock is up 27 per cent for the year to date.Visa announced its results two days after Mr Saunders shook up the company’s management structure, with John Morris stepping down as president to take a different role until he leaves at the end of this year. Visa said the reorganisation was intended to “heighten organisational effectiveness”.In the new structure, the company’s global sales, client service, marketing, product development and innovation functions are consolidated under the leadership of John Partridge, chief operating officer.

China’s largest housebuilder had last week raised Rmb50.2bn ($7.34bn) in the world’s biggest initial public offering since Visa raised $19bn in March 2008.The surge of funds into the market has reignited fears of a new bubble forming in both the property and share markets. The Shanghai Composite index has doubled since it hit bottom late last year, beating all comparable indices around the world.On Wednesday, the Shanghai index sank 5 per cent to 3,266.43, after falling as much as 7.7 per cent in the day. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index ended down 2.4 per cent at 20,135.The collapse of the previous bubble in Shanghai stocks, in October 2007, helped to trigger the global financial crisis. However, international reaction was muted on Wednesday, with European and US equity futures dipping only briefly in response to the Asian news.Investors cited CSCE’s exposure to China’s construction and infrastructure boom in their rush to buy shares.Domestic IPOs were suspended for nine months until this month at a time when large investors in particular were flush with funds accessed through the government’s economic stimulus package.The appetite for new shares is overwhelming, with a record number of 566,937 new trading accounts opened last week, the most since January 2008.Shares in Sichuan Expressway, the first large IPO in Shanghai this year, tripled on debut before closing 203 per cent up on Monday, the first day of trading. The shares have fallen every day since by the maximum daily limit of 10 per cent.The market frenzy has spilled into neighbouring Hong Kong, where on Wednesday, BBMG, a ­Chinese construction material maker, saw its shares rise nearly 60 per cent in the first hour of trading.
441;V;Visa Inc;2009-07-29T07:42:58Z;Chinese shares falter despite record IPO;;China State Construction Engineering, the world’s largest initial public offering in more than a year, saw its shares surge as much as 90 per cent to Rmb7.96 as it started trading in Shanghai on Wednesday.However, investors pulled out of other Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite closing 6.1 per cent lower at 3,227.192, its sharpest one-day fall in eight months. The sell-off in Shanghai led other Asian markets lower, with the MSCI Asia Pacific index down 0.9 per cent.Mainland China has seen a flurry of IPOs this month following a listing suspension and so far, appetite for new shares has been overwhelming.The ample liquidity available in the market has raised concern of a bubble forming. The Shanghai Composite has gained 88.5 per cent since the beginning of the year, beating all major indices around the world.Raising Rmb50.2bn (US$7.3bn), the sheer size of CSCE’s listing made it an important test for the Shanghai market. It was the largest in mainland China since PetroChina’s debut in 2007, which marked the peak of the Chinese market. It was also the largest listing worldwide since Visa raised more than $19bn in March last year.Sichuan Expressway was the first IPO to debut on the Shanghai stock exchange this year and its shares soared 203 per cent on the first day of trading on Monday.The IPO frenzy has spilled into neighbouring Hong Kong. On Wednesday, BBMG, a Chinese construction material maker, also saw its shares rise nearly 60 per cent in the first hour of trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company raised HK$6.8bn (US$883m) last week in the territory’s second biggest IPO this year.Spooked by losses in the mainland stock market, however, the Hang Seng index dropped 3.1 per cent to 19,994.26.
442;V;Visa Inc;2009-07-28T20:40:06Z;Tech sector bright spot on Wall Street;;"Technology was a bright spot for US equities on Tuesday, while the broad market posted modest losses as consumer confidence fell for the second straight month.Earnings were mixed on Tuesday, and the reporting season remains in full swing.Later this week, companies including Dow Chemical, Exxon Mobil, Visa,
and Colgate-Palmolive will report their second-quarter results.After falling as much as 1.3 per cent, the S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 979.62. Equity volatility on the S&P rose, with the CBOE Vix index settling just under 25.Of the 10 major S&P industry sectors, technology was a rare standout, while utilities and energy dropped around 1.5 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite turned positive at mid-afternoon and closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,975.51 as tech continued to exert its leadership over the market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared early losses and settled 0.1 per cent lower at 9,096.72, as energy stocks weighed on blue chips.Ahead of earnings this week, Chevron slipped by 0.7 per cent to $68.34, while Exxon Mobil was down1.2 per cent at $71.89. The Dow was also hurt by American Express, which was lower by 2.5 per cent at $27.68 in the wake of a brokerage downgrade.In deal news, IBM, another member of the Dow, said it will buy SPSS, a provider of predictive analytics software, based in Chicago, for $50 a share, or $1.2bn.Shares in SPSS surged 41 per cent to $49.45, while IBM was lower by 0.3 per cent at $117.28.One bright spot for blue chips was General Electric, up 1.6 per cent at $12.52 as the conglomerate said its finance unit needs further capital.Further signs of a potential bottom in house prices helped homebuilders, with the S&P index up 0.1 per cent.In May, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index posted its first month-over-month gain since its peak in July 2006.“A reversal in the direction of home prices, if sustained, will do a lot to help stabilise the banking system and re-liquefy the economy,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “The broadening out in home price grains is perhaps the most important aspect of the report.”However, the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence dropped more than forecast in July to 46.6, amid concerns over employment prospects.“The US consumer remains the weakest link in the very modest US upswing,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Securities.While the rally from the lows set in March remains intact, with the S&P 500 closing at a fresh eight- month high on Monday, some investors caution that the lowering of the bar for the second-quarter earnings season is an easy hurdle for companies to overcome.“Much of the improvement in profitability appears to be the result of expense-cutting via workforce reductions and inventory management, as opposed to top-line revenue growth,” said Wasif Latif, vice-president of equity investments at USAA Investment Management Company.“More than two-thirds of companies have reported sales declines,” he said. “To increase earnings on a sustainable basis, sales need to pick up.”Among earnings reports, Viacom recorded a drop of 32 per cent in second-quarter profits, as revenue fell 14 per cent to $3.3bn and missed a forecast of $3.5bn. The media conglomerate’s shares closed down 1.8 per cent at $25.15.Meanwhile, Office Depot was trading down 18 per cent at $4.38, after it reported a wider-than-forecast loss of $82m for the second quarter, and sales fell 22 per cent.Valero Energy reported a second-quarter loss, but it beat analysts’ estimates. The independent oil refiner saw its revenue tumble by 51 per cent for the quarter, which was not as bad as feared. That sparked a drop of 2.4 per cent to $18.32 in its shares.Shares in Textron jumped 18 per cent to $13.11. The maker of corporate jets recorded a second-quarter loss and cut its 2009 sales forecast, but beat estimates."
443;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Financial glue that binds Olympic rings holding firm;;When it comes to sponsorship, few sporting events can hold a candle – or a flame – to the Olympic Games.Yet in recent months there have been signs that the financial glue that binds the iconic interlocking rings may be weakening.Four of the 12 companies that signed up with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to become worldwide sponsorship partners for the four-year period that ended with Beijing 2008 have since ended the relationship. One of these companies, Kodak, had been involved with the Olympics since the first modern games were held in 1896.For host cities too (which bring in their own sponsors) the poor health of the global economy is having an impact.Embattled motor manufacturer General Motors, which recently emerged from bankruptcy protection, has been forced to defend its sponsorship of next year’s Winter Olympics in Vancouver while the organisers of London 2012 recently drafted in Cisco to replace beleaguered Nortel as its network infrastructure partner.All this has resulted in a flurry of media commentary suggesting that Olympic sponsorship has lost some of its lustre.However, Michael Payne, the former IOC marketing director whose book Olympic Turnaround chronicles the development of the movement as a business, insists the games remains an unrivalled commercial opportunity.“Nortel dropping out is not the first sponsor to do so – these things happen,” he says. “Interest in the Olympics coming off Beijing is probably stronger that ever in its history.”“The power of the Olympic brand is as strong as ever,” says Chris Townsend, commercial director of Locog, the London organising committee.David Abrutyn, global head of IMG Consulting, part of sport and media group IMG, says only football’s World Cup and Formula One motor racing can rival the Olympics as a platform for global brands. This means, Mr Abrutyn says, that the games can benefit from a “flight to quality” during difficult economic times.“There are very few [sporting events] that mean something around the world – the Olympics is right up there,” he says. Gil Steyaert, UK managing director of long-time Olympic sponsor Adidas, describes the “halo effect” the Olympic Games has on the sportswear manufacturer’s brand.So while the Olympics is in arguably a superior position to some (a number of English football teams, for example, were forced to play without shirt sponsors last season), London 2012 organisers still have their work to do.For one thing – unlike Beijing – London cannot rely on generous state funding. London is also preparing for its games in the middle of a deep global recession.Mr Abrutyn says it is “natural that people will wonder if Locog can get enough sponsors. Is it challenging – absolutely”.Yet many believe London should be given credit for tying up the bulk of its sponsorship before the worst of the recession took hold. Lloyds TSB, British Airways and BT Group are among the blue-chip sponsors already on board and Mr Townsend says Locog has almost £500m of the £650m it is seeking already in place, with further deals imminent.The appeal of the Olympic Games can be attributed to its noble traditions (Olympians are held in higher public esteem than most sporting figures) and unique ability to pull in viewers. Beijing 2008 was the most-watched sporting event in broadcast history, drawing an estimated television audience of 4.7bn people.To take advantage, the games have evolved over three decades into a sophisticated money-making machine that generated $866m for the IOC in sponsorship revenues in the four years to 2008. The Beijing organisers are estimated to have raised a further $1bn from a long list of domestic and international partners, sponsors and exclusive suppliers.Gareth Wynne, group director for the 2012 programme at EDF Group, a London 2012 sponsor, says the Olympics is a “platform to reach out to a global audience” and “very powerful tool with which to advance our strategy”. Part of the strategy is to align the energy provider’s brand with London 2012’s commitment to create a “green” Olympic games.The brand alignment mirrors the strategy of Visa, an Olympic sponsor since 1986.Colin Grannell, head of partnership marketing at Visa Europe, says the tie-up “allows us to take some of the stardust from the Olympics and sprinkle it on the Visa brand. The Olympics have become part of who we are and what we do”. Mr Payne says Visa is a “textbook example” of how to maximise the value of Olympic sponsorship.Yet the Olympics still presents a challenge for its sponsors.This comes partly from the fact that the games are held in “clean” venues largely free of corporate advertising (stadium sponsors are permitted during the Paralympics).“This is not the World Cup or Formula One where you can see your brand everywhere. Yet very few companies understand this,” Mr Grannell says.His message is that the Olympics must be viewed as more than just a one-month “event”.“If you think you can start doing something six months out [from the start of the games] then you’ll never get the returns you’re looking for,” he says.With more than three years to go before the Olympic flame is lit in London, sponsors Visa, EDF and Adidas have already begun rolling out their marketing programmes in anticipation of what Mr Grannell predicts will be “the greatest sporting event ever”.The glue in the Olympics rings, it seems, is holding firm.
444;V;Visa Inc;2009-07-26T22:36:14Z;PayPal plots offline expansion;;Ebay’s PayPal is laying the groundwork for what it hopes will be a massive expansion that could bring its service out of cyberspace and into bricks-and-mortar retail locations around the globe.With the introduction of its Adaptive Payments platform, which will allow software developers to create payment-processing applications for mobile phones and social networking sites, the company hopes for a wave of innovation that could transform offline commerce.Through wider deployment of touch-screen interfaces, biometric technologies and mobile phone payment “wallets”, the group envisions a world where consumers use PayPal to buy everything from cinema tickets to after-work drinks.Initially, the platform will embed PayPal into a range of applications on services such as Facebook and Twitter, and on mobile devices, such as the iPhone.This alone could reap immediate benefits. PayPal has said it expects revenues to double in the next two years, from $2.4bn to $5bn, though much of that growth will come from expansion of current services.In the long term, PayPal’s goal is to capture a larger slice of the global payments market, which is dominated by major credit card companies.“The real holy grail for PayPal is being able to move to the physical world, and being an accepted mark at a physical retail location,” said Bruce Cundiff, director of payments research at Javelin Strategy & Research.This will be no easy task. Credit card companies overshadow PayPal in the offline world. PayPal’s $60bn in total payment volume is just 1 per cent of the total volume processed by Visa and MasterCard combined. And a new payments infrastructure will be needed to complement, or possibly replace, the credit card terminal.But by making its service more widely available, PayPal is seeking to create a ecosystem comparable to those maintained by the credit card companies. “What they’re doing now is a real attempt to replicate the Visa and MasterCard model,” said Mr Cundiff. “They want to make that growth exponential.”
445;V;Visa Inc;2009-07-21T16:16:26Z;China State Construction in $7bn IPO;;China State Construction Engineering Corp, in the world’s largest initial public offering in more than a year, said on Tuesday it planned to raise as much as Rmb50.2bn ($7.3bn) on the back of China’s economic stimulus policies.China’s largest housing contractor will sell as many as 12bn shares at Rmb3.96 to Rmb4.18 each, according to a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange.By setting a higher IPO price than expected, China State Construction dealt a blow to the Shanghai market. The benchmark Shanghai composite index registered its biggest one-day drop in five weeks as subscriptions were taken for the massive public offering.China State Construction’s IPO is many times larger than any other offering approved since China’s securities regulators lifted an unofficial moratorium on IPOs imposed last September.The first of the new batch of IPOs, for Guilin Sanjin Pharmaceuticals and Zhejiang Wanma Cable, rose by 82 to 125 cent on their debut. But the much larger listing for China State Construction will prove a more serious test for the market.China State Construction has said it plans to use the proceeds to expand in residential construction, as a surge in bank lending drives a pick-up in the housing market.Stock market analysts said they thought ample liquidity in China would make it possible to digest the China State Construction listing without negative consequences for the market. The stock is expected to start trading on July 29.China State Construction’s offering is the largest in China since that of PetroChina in October 2007, near the peak of the Chinese market. It is the largest worldwide since Visa Inc raised more than $19bn in March last year.Chinese stock market regulators seem confident about the strength of the local equity markets: they announced on Monday that they would begin taking applications on July 26 for a second board in Shenzhen, focused on innovative and smaller companies. The new Nasdaq-style board is expected to begin trading by October.Meanwhile Chery, one of China’s largest private automakers, said it had resumed preparations for an IPO because of the strength of the auto and stock markets. The group, based in Anhui province, submitted its application to regulatory officials last year but later suspended plans for a listing as the stock market deteriorated.A Chery spokesman declined to say how much the company plans to raise, or when.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
446;V;Visa Inc;2009-07-21T13:42:25Z;Pre-paid cash card targets teenagers;;O2, the mobile phone operator, is to launch a pre-paid Visa cash card targeted at teenagers this summer, as part of its move into the world of personal finance.The company’s O2 Money cash cards, which will be available from late August and will be backed by Natwest bank, can be loaded online or in stores and used in outlets that accept Visa cards.The “Load and Go” card is aimed particularly at young people who want the security of using a card rather than carrying cash on them as the card can be blocked if lost of stolen. The company said it is targeting an estimated seven million people who don’t have a credit or debit card.The cards are fee-free and there are no extra charges for holding the card. But not everyone can have one, it is only available to O2 customers and of those only those aged over 13. A letter will be sent to the parents of those aged under 16 who apply for one of the cards to inform them of the application.Parents will be able to transfer money on to the card over the internet and teenagers will be free to use it to buy goods on the high street and online and will be able to withdraw cash from ATMs.”The strength of our brand and relationship with our customers gives us the ideal opportunity to take O2 into a completely new market,” said Ronan Dunne, O2’s UK chief executive. ”By bringing a fresh, transparent and customer-focused approach to pre-paid cards, we plan to drive this market and take a significant share. In partnership with NatWest, O2 Money is delivering new and innovative ways of helping our customers better connect with their money.”Key features of the cash cards include, cash management, which allows customers to use the cash cards in a similar way to any normal debit card, with the additional benefit of real time balance updates to your mobile after every transaction – and as it is not possible to spend more than has been loaded onto the card, there is no interest charged.However, Load and Go cannot be used in certain retail outlets and websites, such as online gambling sites. And with no overdraft facility there’s no danger of going overdrawn. Customers will also get an SMS text alerts with an account balance when they make a payment.The launch of Load and Go comes alongside the launch of another fee-free prepay card called Cash Manager, but this is aimed at adults. The cards are O2’s first steps into the personal finance market and the mobile operator said it hopes the cards will be a solution to the problem of overspending in the current economic climate.
447;V;Visa Inc;2009-06-29T17:31:41Z;VisaNet demand lifts hopes for IPOs;;Investors on Monday rushed to buy stocks of VisaNet, the Brazilian arm of credit card group Visa, in a healthy sign for the initial public offering market.Shares in the company at one point hit R$17.20, a 15 per cent rise, on its first day of trading in São Paulo following the company’s IPO of $4.3bn at the end of last week.The strong demand for shares in VisaNet, the biggest IPO of the year, shows that investors in the region have not lost their appetite for new stocks.It raises hopes for other companies seeking to raise money on the equity markets.Demand for new stocks is a closely watched gauge of investor appetite for risk.The VisaNet IPO was the biggest in Brazilian history.The shares fell back to R$16.61, a 10.73 per cent gain, by mid-session.Most analysts and brokers had expected the stocks to do well because of the success of the IPO, which was nearly 10 times subscribed.Mauricio Gallego, manager for private investors at São Paulo brokers Link Investimentos, said: “There was a lot of volume. The first half hour was really concentrated.”However, Igor Mesquita from brokers Spinelli Corretora was a little disappointed.“We were expecting a little higher, going by similar actions in the past.”Many investors were attracted to the shares by hopes that Brazil’s credit card market would continue to grow.It has expanded 22 per cent in 2008 and about 20 per cent every year since 1995, according to Itau Unibanco Holding, the nation’s largest bank.VisaNet has 46.8 per cent of the Brazilian credit card market.Cuts in Brazilian interest rates, which are at record lows of 9.25 per cent, should encourage the use of credit cards, analysts say.However, some were taken by surprise by the leap in price as the Brazilian Bovespa index has advanced close to 40 per cent this year. The analysts said gains could have been limited because of this.The IPO market has seen new signs of life in the last quarter after a poor start to the year. New issuance has risen to $11.74bn this year, according to Dealogic. This is a fraction more than the second half of last year, which was the lowest since Dealogic’s records began in 1995.Retail investors received about 38 per cent of the shares they subscribed for in the equity offering.But local institutions only received about 10 per cent of what they asked for, with overseas investors taking the lion’s share of the deal, according to brokers.
448;V;Visa Inc;2009-06-29T08:39:49Z;Emerging market IPOs;;"Brazil, not content with its reputation for beautiful people and awesome football players, is making the world feel inadequate in other areas. VisaNet, the Brazilian affiliate of Visa, is raising $4.3bn in the world’s largest initial public offering this year. VisaNet’s warm reception was underpinned by low credit penetration and relatively rosy forecasts for Brazil’s economy. But that the year’s two largest IPOs are in São Paulo and Hong Kong, knocking the US from its customary top spot for offerings, has reinvigorated chatter about a “decoupling” of emerging markets from their developed counterparts.A little perspective is required here. True, equity capital market issuance in the US and Europe has been dominated by banks seeking to plug balance sheet holes rather than fund growth. But that is one sign of those markets’ maturity. Companies in developing nations still struggle to bolster balance sheets by raising equity. Banks remain reluctant to underwrite secondary deals given high volatility. Private equity groups waiting to clear lofty return hurdles may be delaying new issues in Europe and the US. And emerging market IPO volumes so far this year remain barely 6 per cent of 2007’s total, according to Dealogic, even excluding the bubble-icious listings in China’s domestic currency market.There is, however, an air of confidence at Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa exchange, which has overtaken the likes of NYSE Euronext in terms of market capitalisation. It is modernising apace, opening more international offices and is supported by a solid domestic asset management industry. Companies that in the 1990s rushed to secure US attention through listings of American Depositary Receipts are now deterred by the costs and hassle involved. New York used to worry about losing listings to London. As global investors become accustomed to trading through domestic exchanges, the danger for both is that emerging markets issuers prefer staying close to home.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

449;V;Visa Inc;2009-06-28T21:34:16Z;VisaNet shares begin trading;;The global IPO market will on Monday face its biggest test this year as shares in VisaNet, the Brazilian arm of the credit card giant Visa, begin trading.Initial public offerings have had one of their weakest runs on record but there are more recent signs that investor appetite for new stocks is beginning to return.VisaNet last week raised $4.3bn selling shares at Rs15, matching its advisers’ best estimates and the biggest IPO so far this year. Bankers will on Monday watch appetite for the shares in the secondary market as a gauge of investor demand for new stocks.The VisaNet deal meant $11.5bn of new shares have been issued this year, just $8m above the total for the second half of last year, which was the lowest since Dealogic’s records began in 1995.Appetite for IPOs is one closely-watched gauge of investor appetite for risk. The market has been virtually shut during the financial crisis but a boom in the last quarter for corporate debt – including more speculative junk bonds – has raised hopes the IPO market will more fully re-open in the second half of the year.The VisaNet IPO was the biggest IPO in Brazilian history and it was greeted with enthusiasm by brokers and investors alike. “It was seven to ten times oversubscribed, from everybody – small investors, Brazilian institutions and foreigners,” said one São Paulo broker, who did not want to be named. “It was a big surprise, especially as the market is already up a lot this year.”Retail investors got about 38 per cent of the share they subscribed for. Foreigners appear to have been given priority over local institutions who, according to one broker, got only about 10 per cent of what they asked for. “Over 80 per cent of the volume was sold to foreign investors and most of them were institutional buyers,” said Carlos Eduardo Schahin, director of Schahin Corretora, a Brazilian broker. “This shows the huge amount of interest from investors in good assets.”VisaNet has 46.8 per cent of the Brazilian credit market, which has continued to grow throughout the financial crisis.“It shows how interesting this asset is,” said Mr Schahin. “The volume of credit in Brazil is small compared to the rest of the world. Also we still have a significant amount of cheque book users who will soon be replacing their cheque books with credit cards or debit cards.” The IPO is also being seen as a positive test for the Brazilian economy.Secondary trading on Monday is expected to be “volatile”, according to Mr Schahin.The US is traditionally the leader in hosting new companies coming to the markets. In the past three months there have been eight IPOs in the US from small companies, raising a combined $1.1bn. There has been just one deal in Europe, which raised $339m. But the three biggest deals so far this year have come from companies based in emerging markets, with China Zhongwang raising $1.3bn and Vodafone Qatar $950m.Bankers however expect the market to begin opening up in the second half of the year.“We’ve seen a growing number of companies going public who’ve priced well and whose shares have performed well in the aftermarket,” said Mark Hantho, global head of equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank. He said the bank was seeing increased interest in IPOs from clients around the world.“I expect to see a definite pick-up in activity in the last quarter of this year and a more broad-based recovery in IPO markets next year,” he said.Additional reporting by Jonathan Wheatley in Sao Paulo
450;V;Visa Inc;2009-06-26T08:13:40Z;Spike Lee: With user-generated content, who needs ad agencies?;;A boy lies on his back on a boardroom table in a high-rise office block in Toyko. He pulls out his Nokia, takes a photo of the setting sun – upside down – and sends it to his girlfriend in New York, where dawn is breaking. “Now I know we share the same horizon,” says the voiceover. “My sunset is your sunrise.”It’s a brilliant Nokia ad – the sort of simple, well-executed idea that agencies charge six-figure sums for. Only this one wasn’t made by an ad agency – it was made by Hiroki Ono, a 23-year-old film student from Yokohama, Japan, who’d never made an ad before. The film, “Feel the globe”, took just two days to make.Hiroki’s 30-second video was the winner of a competition run by Mofilm – a group working with film schools and YouTube addicts to find the best in user-generated content. Mofilm convinced companies such as Visa, HP, Best Buy and AT&T to “put their brands in the hands of consumers”, as Nokia’s head of brand engagement, Fiona Bosman, put it at yesterday’s press conference at the Cannes Lions advertising festival.Judging this contest was Spike Lee, director of Malcolm X and Inside Man and an enthusiastic supporter of user-generated content and DIY filmmaking.“I watched the final 12 films, the quality is amazing,” he said. “I think that this demonstrates that you can’t dictate where talent is. The same way I feel you don’t have to go to film school to be a filmmaker, you don’t have to be an employee of an advertising agency to make advertising also.”In a climate where clients are putting pressure on agency fees and demanding more for less, the last thing advertising companies need is free competition from YouTube addicts.Mofilm have put proper contracts in place to ensure that advertisers don’t make off with the content developed in this contest without proper compensation, but not all crowdsourcing efforts reward their contributors.But in spite of the risk of exploitation – and to his own agency, Spike DDB – Lee will continue to support such ventures.“Anything that gives young people the chance to show what they can do is important,” he said. “Historically, institutions try to keep everything on lockdown.”Lee reckons the UGC revolution has further to run, too.“We’re going to come to a time very soon where … I’ll be paying whatever it costs to go to a theatre and see a film that was shot on a regular digital phone,” he predicted.Rather than seeing this as a threat, Lee says that agencies should embrace the mass of untapped talent out there – not least in this time of budget cuts.“The economy is down the toilets. Everybody is affected by this. To be able to survive, we have to turn negatives into positives. Maybe you don’t hire me because I cost a lot of money and you give some young talented and hungry guy a shot. I just talked myself out of some jobs [but] that’s the reality.”Hear more from Spike Lee in this Audioboo interview from Cannes.

Paul Jones, former chairman and chief executive of Compass Bancshares; and Donald Powell, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chairman.Temple Sloan, a long-time director, stepped down from the board last week, and Robert Tillman, former chief executive of Lowe’s, revealed his retirement on Thursday. Two more BofA directors are expected to announce their resignations as early as Monday. BofA would not disclose their identities. BofA’s 18-member board has come under pressure as details about the bank’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch, championed by chief executive Ken Lewis, have emerged.New York’s attorney-general revealed that Mr Lewis tried to back out of the deal in December because of Merrill’s mounting losses. The deal closed only after federal regulators, led by former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, supposedly threatened to remove Mr Lewis and his board if BofA didn’t go ahead with the transaction.Those disclosures helped undermine investor support for Mr Lewis, who was stripped of his chairman title at BofA’s annual meeting in April. The new board chair, Walter Massey – president emeritus of Morehouse College – began a search for new board members. BofA said on Thursday that Amy Brinkley, chief risk officer, would step down at the end of June to be replaced by Greg Curl, head of strategy and corporate development.As chief risk officer, Ms Brinkley presided over growing losses at the bank’s credit card business and in BofA’s portfolio of collateralised debt obligations. Still, Mr Lewis’ decision to replace Ms Brinkley, a friend and stalwart supporter over several decades, came as a shock to people familiar with the pair. Ms Brinkley and her husband were among the few couples who would occasionally be invited to dinner at Mr Lewis’ home in Charlotte, North Carolina.Mr Lewis, is scheduled to appear before the House committee on oversight and government reform on Thursday to discuss the events surrounding BofA’s acquisition of Merrill."
452;V;Visa Inc;2009-05-20T15:45:41Z;Banks and insurers: All change for once-mighty financial names;;"The headline facts in the BrandZ financial institutions category bear witness to the carnage in the sector over the past year.Bank of America and Citi have previously slugged it out for top spot, but now they have fallen to 8th and 11th respectively. In their place, the category is headed by China’s ICBC, followed by its two compatriots China Construction Bank and Bank of China.Meanwhile Wachovia, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and UBS have dropped out of the Top 100 altogether.Scratch beneath the surface, however, and there is an interesting message about the value of brand and the importance of maintaining it. This is highlighted by Millward Brown’s decision not to calculate brand momentum for this category, given the capital markets’ difficulty in assessing even near-term growth prospects in the industry, and to publish instead “brand value as a percentage of market capitalisation”.This metric shows that the big rises in the Chinese banks’ overall brand values are due more to the strong growth in their businesses – a key element in the overall BrandZ methodology – than to the power of their brands per se. Conversely, the sharp falls in overall brand value for some of the western banks reflects the ravages of the credit crunch on their business rather than any issue with the brand.“Many of the banks have maintained their brand equity and the loyalty and trust of their customers to a surprising degree,” says Joanna Seddon, Millward Brown Optimor’s (MBO) chief executive. “The financial collapse is because of things that were nothing to do with brand – it wasn’t the brand that decided to make all those sub-prime loans.“Brand in general has gone down much less than the business; it is playing an important part in some of these banks, keeping up their value when times are rough.”Four big fallers in terms of overall brand value – American Express, RBC, Citi and Bank of America – all saw their brand value rise as a percentage of market capitalisation. Amexco and RBC – along with new entrant and fellow Canadian brand TD (Toronto-Dominion) – head the rankings if viewed on this basis, whereas HSBC’s fourth place in the category ranking is due more to its enormous presence in China and elsewhere in Asia (HS, stands for “Hongkong (correct) and Shanghai”) than to any particular strength in the brand.Underlining the strength and growing influence of the Chinese banks is China Merchants Bank, new to the BrandZ Top 100, but able to boast the biggest single rise in brand value of any company covered – 168 per cent. It is the country’s first share-holding commercial bank wholly owned by corporate legal entities. Its heavy focus on customer service sets it apart from other Chinese banks, says Frederica Fok, consultant at MBO, while it has used a big expansion of its credit cards businesses to develop its brand.Another entrant to the Top 100 is Bradesco, the first from Brazil to make it to the ranking, demonstrating the growing importance of another of the Bric nations – Brazil, Russia, India and China.Cristiana Pearson, associate director at MBO, highlights Bradesco as “a very special brand in Brazil – they’ve benefited tremendously from both their financial stability and the country’s economic growth in Brazil, where the lower socio-economic groups in particular experienced significant growth. Bradesco has always been very strong among this group, being known as ‘the bank with open doors’”.The other notable new entrant in this category is Visa, the world’s largest payment card network, which could not be valued for the BrandZ ranking before last year’s initial public offering. (For more on the development of the Visa brand, see the interview with Antonio Lucio, its chief marketing officer, to be published online at www.ft.com/global-brands-2009 on Thursday April 30)A bright spot was the performance of Spanish banks BBVA and Santander, whose brand value rose 33 and 10 per cent respectively. Quite how things will look a year on remains to be seen: until the autumn, Spanish banks were being lauded for their strong capitalisation but the outlook has darkened in recent months.In the insurance sector top 10, by contrast, every company has seen its brand value fall. Allianz saw a modest 9 per cent decline, while Mitsui Sumitomo and AIG fell a whopping 82 and 79 per cent, respectively.Here again, value as a percentage of business value has been calculated rather than momentum, but the scores are much lower than for the banks and there is less differentiation.Some insurers managed modest increases in brand value as a percentage of market capitalisation, but that is more a reflection of sharply falling capitalisation than any inherent power in the brand.As Ms Seddon puts it: “None of them has a very strong brand.” As a result, this sector is by a long chalk the biggest loser in terms of overall brand value, down 48 per cent compared with just 11 per cent for financial institutions."
453;V;Visa Inc;2009-05-12T21:40:33Z;US antitrust;;"The role of government in ensuring markets are sufficiently competitive to put an economy’s resources to their best use has always shifted according to prevailing political tides. This week the Department of Justice duly announced a significant change in its approach to antitrust law. Out goes the belief companies are best left to thrash things out themselves. In comes the view that unbridled competition cannot be relied on to tackle over mighty businesses that abuse their monopolistic powers.Some argue the laisser faire Bush administration was simply out to help its corporate friends. Compared with the Clinton years, during which the DoJ aggressively went after Microsoft, American Airlines and Visa, for example, competition lawyers have for much of this decade been twiddling their thumbs. According to the Center for American Progress, there was a five-year stretch when no merger cases were brought to court at all.The Obama government now says it will “aggressively pursue cases” again, opening up yet another line of government intervention in the economy. Who dares argue against protecting consumers or plucky small companies trying to make a buck? The change, however, is couched in worryingly ideological terms. The administration argues that “recent developments in the marketplace should make it clear that we can no longer rely upon the marketplace alone to ensure that competition and consumers will be protected”.But does a meltdown originating in financial markets really mean that software makers, say, are now more prone to anti-competitive behaviour? It is hard to see how. The Obama administration has every right to reject its predecessor’s competition policy. But there is no “right way” to deal with antitrust issues, as it suggests. The reality is that few academics or lawyers even agree on how to identify anti-competitive behaviour, let alone how to remedy it. This move is part of a broader political and economic wind sweeping across Washington.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

454;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard;There are some things money can’t buy;"A rebound in consumer spending would be “priceless”, as MasterCard might put it. The world’s second largest electronic payments network on Friday reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profits. The fall was largely due to the strength of the US dollar but also reflected changing consumer behaviour. In these leaner times, shoppers are holstering their credit cards in favour of spending via debit cards money they actually have – particularly in the US where credit card volumes dropped 14 per cent year on year. As three-quarters of US debit cards carry the logo of Visa, its larger competitor, MasterCard must sit this recession out.It might be in for a long wait. Splashing out on credit requires confidence to return but consumers are unlikely to feel that before bringing current debts under control. That is a work of years, not months.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

455;V;Visa Inc;2009-04-30T21:25:46Z;Chrysler failure sparks rally for Ford and GM;;US stocks gave up early gains on Thursday afternoon after President Barack Obama announced car maker Chrysler was to file for bankruptcy protection.The news triggered a one per cent fall in equities as investors worried about the effect on the wider economy.But the benchmark S&P 500 closed the month with a gain of 9.4 per cent, the best month since March 2000.Other troubled carmakers benefited from Chrysler’s news, with investors betting they were now more likely to survive. GM picked up 6.1 per cent to $1.92 while Ford gained 9.7 per cent to $5.98.But some analysts warned the bankruptcy could prove a turning point in the recent rally. “The market has absorbed some bad economic news recently, but you could see a pull back after a major event like today’s,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.Earlier in the day, several better-than-expected earnings announcements had led a strong rally. Industrial group Dow Chemical led the materials sector ahead of every other on the S&P after reporting a surprise profit as spending controls helped the company overcome falling sales. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $16.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 872.81 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.2 per cent lower at 8,168.12 points. But the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.3 per cent to 1,717.30 points.Banks had gained earlier after a bullish note from Anthony Bolton, president of investments at Fidelity International, on the position of banks to lead equities out of the slump. But after the news on Chrysler, they fell back. Citigroup closed 2.2 per cent down at $3.05, while JPMorgan lost 4.3 per cent to $33.The early gains came amid mixed economic data, as personal income and spending both fell more sharply than predicted. But investors were buoyed by figures showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits continued to fall for the first time last week, even though the number continuing to claim such benefits reached a new record high.“It seems like we have turned a corner this week,” said Ian Griffiths, a dealer at CMC Markets. “There has been some pretty bad news, which the market has ignored to remain bullish.”There was also mixed news for consumer stocks, as weak sales at rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive countered better-than-expected results at Starbucks and Kellogg.P&G and Colgate both met or beat analysts expectations with first-quarter profits. However, investors fretted over falling sales at each, and P&G lost 1.9 per cent to $49.44 while Colgate dropped 1.2 per cent to $59.Starbucks beat expectations as cost cuts compensated for sliding sales. The company has come under pressure from cheaper retailers, but its shares rallied on Thursday as chief executive Howard Schultz promised a marketing campaign focusing on value. The shares rose 5.6 per cent to $14.46.Kellogg also saw falling sales, but its cereal division showed strength, lifting profits and sending its stock up 6.6 per cent to $42.11.Changes to the number of people watching television led to mixed results for Comcast, the cable TV provider and Viacom, the media group that owns the MTV network.Comcast added subscribers and raised profits, helping to lift its share price 1.4 per cent to $15.46.Viacom found its viewing numbers under pressure though, which, added to slowing revenues from advertising, and saw the company report falling revenues and profits. But the market had predicted even worse and its shares picked up 5 per cent to $20.66.Meanwhile, Visareported rising revenues as more customers used the company’s debit cards. Cost cuts also helped boost profits above the level analysts had predicted and its shares gained 2.3 per cent to $64.96.There was good news for Expedia, the online travel agency, which has suffered recently as investors feared the outbreak of swine flu would discourage travel, after it announced its profits had not fallen as far as expected. Its shares surged 28.5 per cent to $13.61.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly-traded company, reported lower profits than expected, as the recession weighed on demand for oil. Exxon shares fell 2.6 per cent to $66.67.
456;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
457;V;Visa Inc;2009-04-30T15:27:50Z;Banks and earnings fuel optimism on Wall St;;Wall Street continued rising above the three month high set during the previous session on Thursday morning after another bullish analyst note on banks added a sheen to several better-than-expected earnings announcements.Industrial group Dow Chemical led the materials sector ahead of every other on the benchmark S&P 500 index after reporting a surprise profit as low materials costs and tight spending controls helped the company overcome worse sales than expected. Its shares jumped 18.2 per cent to $15.97.Banks added to the earnings optimism after Anthony Bolton, the UK-based executive at Fidelity International, said he thought the recent equity market gains marked a bull market rather than a bear market rally. He added that beaten-down financials could lead the way out of the slump. This came the day after Fox-Pitt Kelton said any dilution to shareholder value resulting from capital raising following the government’s stress tests on the banks was already priced into banks’ shares.Citigroup gained 2.9 per cent to $3.21. Meanwhile Bank of America, where Ken Lewis was replaced as chairman on Wednesday night while keeping his role as chief executive, rose 4.3 per cent to $9.05.In the first half-hour of trade, the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 884.86, while the Dow gained 1.2 per cent to 8,281.94 points and those the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 1.9 per cent to 1,743.69 points.The gains came amid mixed economic news, as personal income and spending both fell more sharply than predicted. But investors were buoyed by figures showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time continued to fall last week, even though the number continuing to claim such benefits made another record high.There was mixed news for consumer companies, as weak sales at rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive subtracted from stronger than expected results at both Starbucks and Kellogg.Procter & Gamble, which makes consumer products from Head & Shoulders to Pringles crisps, reported better profits than analysts’ estimates and reaffirmed its full year profits outlook. But its shares fell as it warned that full-revenues might come in below expectations as the company foresaw another quarter of destocking by retailers. The stock lost 3.5 per cent to $48.64.Colgate-Palmolive gained however, after reporting rising profits which were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. The company successfully raised its prices and cut its costs to report earnings of $0.97 per share, but its stock fell as sales remained weak, losing 1.2 per cent to $59.Starbucks also beat analysts’ expectations as efforts to slash costs compensated for an 8 per cent fall in revenue. The company has come under pressure for customers from cheaper retailers such as McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts, but its shares rallied on Thursday as Howard Schultz, its chief executive, promised a marketing campaign focusing on value. The shares rose 10.5 per cent to $15.13.Kellogg was another company involved in food to suffer falling sales during the first three months of the year, but its cereal division showed some strength, helping its profits rise and sending its shares up 8.2 per cent to $42.73.Changes to the number of people watching television led to mixed results for Comcast, the cable TV provider and Viacom, the media group that owns the MTV network among others. Comcast was able to add subscribers and boost profits, helping to raise its share price 5.8 per cent to $16.13.Viacom found its viewing numbers under pressure though, which, added to slowing revenues from advertising, saw the company report falling revenues and profits. But the market had predicted even worse from the group and its shares picked up 3.2 per cent to $22.43.Meanwhile, Visa, the credit card company, reported rising revenues as more customers used the company’s debit cards. Cost cuts also helped boost profits above the level analysts had predicted and its shares gained 3.8 per cent to $65.90.Health insurer Aflac also beat estimates, with a 20 per cent rise in profits being helped by the strength in the yen. The company, which gets most of its revenue from Japan, has fallen over 36 per cent this year as Wall Street worries about the quality of its investments. The shares rose however, gaining 1.3 per cent to $29.50.There was good news for travel stocks, which have suffered recently as investors feared the outbreak of swine flu would discourage people from travelling, after Expedia, the online travel agency, announced its profits had not fallen as far as expected. Its shares surged 24.7 per cent to $13.21.But Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest publicly traded company, fell after reporting lower profits than expected, as the recession translated into falling demand for oil. With oil prices also falling back from the previous session, the company gave up 1.3 per cent to $67.53.European stocks were up early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gaining 2.1 per cent to 833.50 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly up, as the FTSE Asia-Pacific index rose 3.5 per cent to 172.10 points.Bond yields were lower, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note falling 3 basis point to 0.922 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note losing 1bp to 3.1 per cent.The dollar was mixed against major currencies early in New York, and lost 0.5 per cent against the yen to $0.0102.Gold was trading $1.57 lower at $883.88 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices were $0.35 lower at $50.62 a barrel.
458;V;Visa Inc;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
459;V;Visa Inc;2009-04-23T21:09:25Z;US shares struggle on economic news;;US stocks struggled for direction before ending higher on Thursday as investors reacted to quarterly earnings reports from companies including Apple and United Parcel Service and digested more disappointing economic news.UPS reported quarterly profits that missed analysts’ estimates and forecast no quick turnaround as the global economic downturn continued to take its toll on the world’s largest package delivery group.Its quarterly net income fell by 56 per cent, from $906m a year earlier to $401m. Its shares fell 2.6 per cent to $53.33. Shares in its main competitor, FedEx, which like UPS has been on a cost-cutting drive, rose 3.4 per cent to $55.04.In contrast, Apple said after the market closed on Wednesday that its profit had risen 15 per cent to $1.21bn, or $1.33 a share, compared with forecasts of $1.08. Its shares closed 3.2 per cent higher at $125.40 in spite of a relatively downbeat forecast for the current quarter, with revenues estimated at $7.7bn-$7.9bn and earnings at $0.95-$1 a share.The previous session had ended lower with leading indices giving up an earlier rally, leaving some analysts to express doubt about the sustainability of the rebound. A late sell-off in the financial sector had erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher at 851.92 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,652.21 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7.957.06 points.The CBOE’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was down 2.5 per cent at 37.15 and remains significantly below highs of approaching 90 reached last year, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Disappointing economic news also weighed on stocks with a weekly report on jobless claims saying the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance in the week ending April 18 rose by 27,000 to a higher than expected 640,000, while continuing claims crept up again to a new record high.The pace of sales of existing homes in the US fell 3 per cent in March to a sharply lower-than-expected 4.57m unit annual rate, according to the National Association of Realtors.Shares ended higher led by late gains for banks and companies involved in the credit card business. These moved higher after senior executives from the industry met with President Barack Obama. Representatives from banks including Wells Fargo, Visa, JPMorgan, MasterCard and Visa, were among those at the meetings. Wells Fargo shares rose 10.5 per cent to $20.09 while Capital One shares rose 17.7 per cent to $16.93.The earnings season is in full swing with many reports issued before the bell on Thursday and several more due after the close. Before the open, Hershey and Raytheon posted better-than-expected results. Shares in Hershey rose 3.9 per cent to $37.45 while Raytheon rose 5.9 per cent to $43.72.Fifth Third Bancorp shares rose 3.5 per cent to $3.82 after it also beat analyst expectations, posting a smaller than expected loss.Boutique investment bank KBW swung to a first-quarter profit on lower costs that offset declines in commissions and investment-banking revenue.Shares in the company advanced 2.6 per cent to $24.87.SunTrust Banks shares fell 3.3 per cent to $14.89 after it swung to a $714.8m first-quarter loss, hurt by real-estate and mortgage investments and ”recession-related costs” as it boosted reserves for bad loans. PNC Financial Services’ shares rose 7.5 per cent to $40.93 as first-quarter profits came in well ahead of expectations. Microsoft, American Express and Amgen were due to report after the closing bell last night. Microsoft shares moved 1.2 per cent lower to $18.54.The exchange sector was in focus as profits at the CME Group operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, plunged by 30 per cent in the first three months of the year from the same period in 2008.But in spite of this, CME shares rose 9.4 per cent, to $239 leading other exchanges groups higher.Shares in NYSE Euronext were up 13.7 per cent at $23.37 while Nasdaq OMXshares rose 3.3 per cent.
460;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Equity market rebound fuels hopes for revival of IPOs;;The global equity capital markets have shown signs of life in recent weeks but a rush to the public markets is likely to take a lot longer to materialise.Since the start of April, 11 initial public offerings have priced across the globe, three in New York, one in Toronto, one in Hong Kong and six in Korea, according to Dealogic, the data provider.This represents a veritable flurry by recent barren standards and has raised hopes in some quarters that the recent rally in equity markets might be fuelling confidence in the capital raising market.Of the 11 deals that have priced this month, just four raised more than $100m – those of Rosetta Stone, a language learning software provider, Bridgepoint Education, an online university, Changyou.com, a video game maker, and Silver Base Group Holdings, a consumer products company.Last week – when both Bridgepoint and Rosetta Stone started trading – was the first week with two IPOs from US companies since May last year. The two groups raised a combined $254.3m of the $269.3m in global IPO activity last week, providing a boost to a market that is off to its slowest start since 1988.For this year to date, global IPO volume totals $1.9bn, according to Thomson Reuters, a 96 per cent decrease from the year-ago period, which featured the record- breaking US IPO of Visa, the credit card company.Offerings from issuers in Asia-Pacific have accounted for the vast majority of IPO activity this year, although the largest was the New York Stock Exchange listing of Mead Johnson, a US paediatric nutrition company, which raised $828m in February.Equity capital markets bankers are optimistic, if cautiously so, about the prospects for a more lasting upturn.Paul Donahue, co-head of US equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley, said: “We think there are definitely signs of life and they are more than nascent. That doesn’t mean we are going to see a flurry of deals, because IPOs typically have a longer gestation period.”Mr Donahue also pointed out that volatility in the equity markets was now well below the levels that it reached late last year, giving further encouragement to those wishing to pursue a public listing.The CBOE’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, is now at about the 35 mark, having approached 90 in October last year.The CBOE’s Vix is a measure of the implied volatility of options on the S&P 500 index and its relatively low level compared with the recent past suggests that conditions are becoming more conducive for companies considering raising money through an IPO.Bankers also said optimism had been raised because some “riskier” parts of the capital markets are starting to perform well.The Russell 2000, which, because it consists of small-caps, is generally considered to be more risky, has outperformed the S&P 500 recently.A few weeks ago, bankers said a period of steady gains from equities could kick-start the IPO market, particularly as the pipeline and backlog of deals remains healthy as many companies have elected to postpone rather than completely cancel their plans.One banker said the mere fact that deals that had come to market recently – such as Rosetta Stone – had worked, was helpful for the wider market in terms of instilling confidence that investors are ready to back a company with a compelling story.The pipeline for offerings is also relatively healthy.China Zhong Wang, a maker of aluminium products, this week began the marketing of its Hong Kong listing that could raise $1.6bn and become the world’s biggest offering since last summer, when China South Locomotive raised $1.57bn in August.Also this week, Ellora Energy, which develops onshore oil and gas properties in Texas, Louisiana and Kansas, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO.But demonstrating the fine balance of sentiment, NiSource Energy Partners, which owns and operates natural gas transportation pipelines and related energy infrastructure assets, withdrew its plans for an IPO on Friday last week because of poor market conditions.Another source of optimism for the capital raising markets was the $5bn follow-on offering from Goldman Sachs last week, the largest follow-on offering since October last year when Bank of America raised $10bn.The volume of follow-on offerings has been relatively strong this year. Globally, follow-ons, including rights offerings, have fetched $106.7bn in proceeds, a 56 per cent increase from the same period in 2008.In spite of signs of optimism, it remains the case that the rate of IPOs has slowed to no more than a trickle over the course of the financial crisis so far.Any indication that companies are starting to raise money in the public equity markets raises hopes that a fledgling recovery is under way but the finely balanced sentiment in markets means investors are also taking such positive signs thus far with a healthy pinch of salt.
461;V;Visa Inc;2009-04-21T18:47:19Z;US custody banks hit by profits slump;;The fall in global markets during the past year has hit first-quarter profits at three large US custody banks and at BlackRock, the largest publicly traded fund manager.Custody banks hold stocks and bonds in safekeeping, and are responsible for settlement when they change hands.State Street, a custody bank but also the world’s largest asset manager after overtaking Barclays Global Investors following the sale of BGI’s iShares unit, saw profit fall 9 per cent to $476m.Assets under management fell 29 per cent to $2,000bn, while assets under custody fell 24 per cent to $11,300bn.Ron Logue, chief executive, warned that profits were likely to be down by at least 12 per cent in the coming year, indicating the worst was not over.Bank of New York Mellon cut its dividend to 9 cents a share, from 24 cents, saying that this would save $700m a year and help the bank quickly repay the $3bn it received under the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).BNY Mellon, which also has a large asset management division, said its profits fell 57 per cent to $322m.Rob Kelly, chief executive, said that “it feels like we’re at, or close to, the bottom” of the economic cycle, although he said loan losses could continue for some time.Northern Trust’s profits fell 58 per cent to $162m after its assets under management declined by 33 per cent – to $522bn – and assets under custody dropped by 29 per cent to $2,800bn.However, in the 2008 quarter it received $244m in proceeds from the initial public offering of Visa. Excluding that, its quarterly profit drop was 30 per cent. Northern Trust reiterated that it too wants to return its $1.6bn in Tarp money.Asset management firms almost never make a loss, because their revenue is derived from a fee on the money they manage. The 40 per cent drop in the Standard & Poor’s index compared with the same quarter last year has caused management fees to plunge.BlackRock’s profits fell 65 per cent to $84m. The drop was partly because of a loss of $153m from its co-investments and seed investments in its own funds.BlackRock attracted $138bn in new money in the 12 months to the end of March but its assets under management fell 6 per cent to $1,280bn, as a result of market falls. The drop was still much lower than other asset managers.
462;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;French take a lead in mobile payments;;"The mobile phone is at last poised to replace the purse – and thanks to a classic piece of pan-industry collaboration, the French may be among the first to achieve the critical mass needed for contactless mobile phone payments to replace coins in daily life.Consumer trials of contactless mobile payments lasting almost two years have demonstrated the success of interoperability standards in Caen and Strasbourg.Big French retail chains will soon begin equipping check-outs nationwide to process contactless payments using Near Field Communication technology.With mobile manufacturers set to begin bulk shipments of NFC-enabled phones this autumn, French consumers may soon be able to settle transactions of less than €20 by simply waving a phone or card in front of an electronic reader.For banks and card companies, low-value payments are the last frontier. Leo Van Hove, associate professor of economics at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, argues that cash is “too cheap” for users, but, for example, costs Netherlands taxpayers €300 per family per year.Central banks agree, putting the cost of printing, issuing and recalling old-fashioned folding notes and coins at between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent of gross domestic product.Electronic payments, especially by cards, are now a standard tool for consumer purchases across Europe. But few retailers will accept credit or debit card payments for purchases below €15, complaining that “merchant” fees charged by card issuers and banks are too high. Efforts to overcome this by adding an “electronic purse”, branded Moneo, to many cards issued in France have been largely ignored by consumers.Card issuers have responded by adopting contactless technology on cards. Visa Europe has been trialling its payWave cards in London and MasterCard is already issuing PayPass “tap-and-go” cards. But outlets with readers remain few and far between.Yet if cash is free to the user, why switch to contactless payments for small ticket items? Howard Wilcox, an analyst at Juniper Research in Basingstoke, has a quick answer: “It is for queue-busting,” he says.The ability to process small-value transactions electronically in less than a second could have big repercussions for transport operators and retailers, says Mr Wilcox. He predicted last July that the total value of NFC transactions worldwide using mobile phones could reach $75bn by 2013. Cash-only retailers face a flight by consumers.Nicolas Houéry, director of the European Association for Mobile Payment (AEPM), and supervisor of the Payez Mobile experiment in Caen and Strasbourg, says the mobile phone has huge advantages over cards as a payment tool.A phone’s SIM card, he says, can carry multiple payment accounts – one for company expenses, another for personal purchases, and so on, and consumers can track payments on its screen.Users carry phones everywhere, and if the phone is lost or stolen, it can be remotely shut down and the data ported in minutes to a new device.Reactions among 1,000 technophile consumers who signed up for the Payez Mobile trial were encouraging. Contactless mobile payments proved popular with both sexes, and all ages.With 500 retailers taking part, the system was widely used in bakeries, stationers, tobacconists, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants.More than a third of payments were valued at less than €5, and 72 per cent at less than €20, although bigger payments could be made with Pin code validation.Nine out of 10 users said they would recommend mobile payments, and 70 per cent of retailers said they would want a terminal if they were commercially available.The trial confirms the success of similar technology in Japan deployed by operator NTT Docomo, which offers a contactless payment service to subscribers via its own bank.A significant feature of the French trial is that it was a collaboration between operators, including Orange and SFR; banks; card issuers, including Visa Europe and MasterCard; payment terminal makers and the French state-sponsored technology cluster for Secure Electronic Transactions, TES.Payments are debited from customer’s existing card accounts, so it opens the way for mobile phones to become payment tools comparable to cards, with banks and operators free to develop and agree varied business models.The payments are not tied to the mobile operator. Indeed, France’s contactless cards and mobiles will be read by a common scanner on the merchant’s terminal.Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile at Visa Europe, predicts that cards and phones will compete for consumer favour for decades, though it will be Visa and its peers handling the transactions on both.However, after previous experience directing contactless phone payment trials at UK mobile operator 02, she has few doubts that phones will ultimately win.Ms Harris says consumers are keen and technology standards are in place. What is lacking is the business model – that is, how the participants, from merchants to banks, carve up the commissions.In highly competitive and innovative markets such as the UK, Ms Harris thinks deals will be struck between banks and operators, but it may take a while to get the critical mass of merchant terminals and owners of NFC phones to achieve widespread use.In France, collaboration looks ready for a widescale roll-out of both in 2010.Mr Houéry reckons arranging deals with public transport operators is a key stepping stone. As Juniper’s Mr Wilcox says: “Transit ticketing is probably the killer application for NFC.”At a time when consumers worldwide are spending less and saving more, contactless card technology has a strong lure for retailers and phone companies who can collaborate, offering the chance of extra business or fees.Ultimately, the biggest benefit will fall to taxpayers, thanks to the falling cost of supplying free cash to the world’s small-spenders."
463;V;Visa Inc;2009-04-09T04:14:20Z;Visa turns mobile phones into credit cards;;Visa, the electronic payment network, will launch its first commercial mobile phone-based contactless payment system in Malaysia on Thursday.The rollout follows a series of successful trials over the past two years involving mobile phones based on the Near Field Communications (NFC) contactless technology which enables users to pay for goods and services simply by “waving” their handset close to a “reader”. Visa already make use of the same technology in its payWave contactless credit or debit cards.In Japan, more than 40m contactless “osaifu-keitai”, or “wallet phones”, have been sold since mid-2004. However, these handsets are based on Sony’s proprietary FeliCa technology rather than the NFC industry standard which was agreed a few years ago and is expected to become popular throughout the world.“We believe that Visa’s NFC mobile payment launch in Malaysia signals a tipping point for the payments industry globally as we move from mobile payment pilots to commercial availability,” said Elizabeth Buse, Global Head of Product at Visa.For the launch in Malaysia, Nokia will supply its Nokia 6212 NFC-enabled handset. Maybank, Malaysia’s largest bank, and Maxis, the largest mobile network operator in the south Asian nation with more than 11m subscribers, are the other partners.The service will only be available to Maybank’s Visa credit cardholders who are also pre-paid Maxis subscribers.An initial 3,000 Nokia handsets will go on sale this month and Maybank Visa card holders will be able to complete transactions by “waving” their devices within a few inches of special point-of-sale readers already installed at more than 1,800 merchant outlets, mostly around the capital, Kuala Lumpur. Visa says that payments made with NFC technology are highly secure.Like other electronic payment network operators Visa is keen to tap the potential of increasingly sophisticated and widespread mobile handsets as a platform for mobile banking. The launch is a key part of Visa efforts to “move electronic payments beyond the card to a vast new market of 4bn mobile subscribers globally,” the company said.The NFC chip embedded in the Nokia 6214 device will also power a number of additional functions, including a contactless transit application that enables Malaysian commuters to pay for charges while using metropolitan transit systems, bus terminals, highway toll gates and car park facilities at more than 3,000 contactless payment touch points throughout Malaysia. Maxis has branded these mobile payment services under the name Maxis FastTap.
464;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Dethroning cash;;"As ever, the gadget-mad Japanese have been doing it for years. But on Thursday Visa announces its first commercial launch of a scheme that enables consumers to make payments by waving their phones at readers next to cash registers. Malaysians can now buy a Nokia phone equipped with a Near Field Communication chip, link it up to their Maybank account, and start spending in 1,800 retailers across the country. The world has inched closer to the cashless economy.Admittedly, the 3,000 NFC-equipped phones initially available represent innovation rather than revolution. But the launch follows years (if not decades) of discussion and pilot schemes. Malaysia goes first thanks to a youthful population, high mobile phone penetration and a public transport system that uses a “tap-and-go” card-reader technology familiar to London commuters. If it is popular, Visa will roll out the system in other countries within 12 months.The attraction for the company is twofold. Visa’s electronic payment network, which serves the credit and debit cards issued by banks bearing its brand, serves 1.7bn accounts worldwide. It is eyeing the 4bn people connected to mobile phone networks round the globe, particularly in emerging nations where banking systems are less well developed.Second, Visa – for which debit card transactions now represent more than two-thirds of total volume – increasingly competes with cash. Tap-and-go payment is intended to replace notes and coins for low-value purchases, such as skinny lattes, and so push electronic payments’ share of consumer spending up from the current 24 per cent. Growing this way also avoids the need to compete aggressively with MasterCard for market share. Mobile phones, meanwhile, continue their transformation into personalised electronic valets. They absorbed the alarm clock, camera, music player and diary – the wallet is next.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

465;V;Visa Inc;2009-04-01T17:48:22Z;Mastercard agrees to cut fees in Europe;;"Mastercard is to reduce sharply fees on cross-border credit card transactions in a deal with Europe’s antitrust authorities. In return, Brussels will stop pursuing the company over allegations its fee structure breached European competition rules.But the deal was met with lukewarm support from retailers, with some calling it a “weak compromise” by Neelie Kroes, Europe’s competition commissioner, and others saying it should be a “first step” only.Mastercard, too, insisted the deal was an “interim arrangement”, and said it still intended to pursue its court challenge over the European Commission’s 2007 decision, which found the interchange fees (MIFs) that Mastercard charged on cross-border transactions were illegal.Interchange fees are those paid between banks servicing shops that accept credit and debit cards and those servicing cardholders.Under Wednesday’s deal, Mastercard’s average interchange fee charged on consumer credit card transactions will fall to 0.3 per cent, and on consumer debit cards to 0.2 per cent.According to Ms Kroes, that is less than half the level ahead of her 2007 decision; fees then were between 0.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent for credit cards, for example.Mastercard has also agreed to repeal other fees and increases that were introduced in October to “plug the gap” when it temporarily withdrew interchange fees altogether on cross-border transactions, to avoid heavy daily fines.Finally, the card company will introduce more “flexibility and transparency” into its rules. A trustee will also monitor adherence to the agreement.“The aim of the new MIFs …is that a merchant’s costs in accepting card payments should be no higher than the benefits from avoiding receiving cash,” said Ms Kroes. “I want to make crystal clear today that, under certain circumstances, reasonable MIFs can be compatible with competition rules”.But Mastercard insisted the new fee level was too low to sustain strong competition in the payments industry or encourage investment: “This is why these rates are only interim, and why we are pursuing our appeal to the European Court of First Instance.”Because national competition authorities have also been looking at the legitimacy of interchange fees on domestic card payments, the battle between Brussels and Mastercard has significant potential implications. Yet by refusing to concede any legal principles, Mastercard has in effect limited the impact.“There’s no connection between what we’ve agreed with the commission and cases within domestic markets,” it said Wednesday.Brussels has also been in talks with Visa Europe over its fees. Brussels is likely to want a level playing-field between the two groups, and the Mastercard deal may set the benchmark.But Visa said only that it strongly believed a negotiated settlement would be best, and pointed out that Ms Kroes herself had made clear that each case should be judged on its merits."
466;V;Visa Inc;2009-03-31T04:06:56Z;Auto fears drive down Wall Street;;The looming threat of bankruptcy at General Motors and Chrysler sent stocks tumbling on Monday after the White House rejected the carmakers’ turnround plans and forced out chief executive Rick Wagoner.GM plunged 25.4 per cent to $2.70 as investors feared for the company’s future after the US government promised to fund it only for another 60 days.Ford, which has said it is not taking part in any government bail-out, lost 2.8 per cent to $2.76.Banks took a hammering on investor concern they might need further government support after several European countries, including Spain, Germany and the UK, moved to shore up domestic lenders. Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, exacerbated those fears when he said some US banks would need “large amounts” of assistance.Bank of America was one of the heaviest fallers, down 17.9 per cent to $6.03 while Citigroup fell 11.8 per cent to $2.31 and Wells Fargolost 14.2 per cent to $13.37.The insurance sector also suffered, and Lincoln National fell 38.2 per cent to $6.41 after it withdrew an application to sell debt with a government guarantee, saying it did not meet the necessary conditions. Credit Suisse downgraded the company to “neutral” on the news, saying: “We expect tension between liquidity needs at the holding company as well as likely further pressure on subsidiary capital levels.”There were also fears that signs of discord from leaders of countries attending the G20 in London this week could hamper attempts at global economic recovery.Marc Pado, chief investment strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The G20 really achieved something in November when they agreed to work towards financial stability. But this time some countries, like Germany, are pushing against further stimulus packages, and that is worrying the markets.”The financial sector as a whole fell 9.4 per cent, which wiped out almost all of the gains made after Mr Geithner announced his plan last week to clear up banks’ balance sheets.A couple of financial companies avoided the gloom. Fifth Third gained 5.5 per cent to $2.48 after it generated $561m in cash by selling its payment processing division to Advent International, a private equity firm.Visa, the credit card company, outperformed the market after Barron’s, the investment magazine, said its steady growth should attract investors. Its shares fell a relatively modest 1.4 per cent to $53.50.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed below 800 points, giving up 3.5 per cent to 787.53 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.3 per cent to 7,522.02 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.8 per cent to 1,501.80 points.John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global, said the market’s response to the news from GM was overdone. “If anything, this is a reaction by the market to the fact that the government is replacing a chief executive of an automotive company. It shows the growing power of Washington in US business.“But we think this sell-off is a bit of an over-reaction as the GM restructuring had already been factored into its share price.”Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, fell 14.2 per cent to $6.69 after China’s Aluminium Corp reported a 99.9 per cent decline in 2008 profit and forecast a first quarter loss as the company felt the effect of lower prices.Other industrial companies fell, with Caterpillar losing 9.3 per cent to $27.53. General Electric dropped 7.9 per cent to $9.93 even though Nani Beccalli, chief executive of GE International, told the Financial Times he saw “signs of life” in the US and European economies.Bristol Myers Squibb was a rare gainer, its shares lifting 1.7 per cent to $21.02 after the US Food and Drug Administration said analyses of its experimental diabetes drug showed it met the agency’s guidelines.Oil prices fell below $50 for a barrel of US crude, and energy companies followed. Chevron dropped 3.1 per cent to $66.80 and Exxon Mobil fell 1.9 per cent to $68.63.CBS, the media company, fell sharply after UBS recommended that investors sell its shares as advertising revenues continue to weaken. Its stock lost 17.8 per cent to $3.79.
467;V;Visa Inc;2009-03-27T15:42:26Z;New alert after online theft doubles;;Online shoppers are being advised to protect themselves against a doubling in cyber-crime. Last year, thieves stole more than £50m through website purchases, according to the UK payments association, up from £22m the year before.And there are now signs that banks may be looking for ways to avoid responsibility for covering these losses. Under the Banking Code, those who have not acted with “reasonable care” to protect their details won’t be protected. However, “reasonable care” no longer means safeguarding PIN details but having up-to-date antivirus software and avoiding malicious emails.Banking security expert Steven Murdoch, from the University of Cambridge, says the most effective protection should come from the banks, but there are some things that consumers can do.Get Safe Online (www.getsafeonline.org), the government-backed consumer website, is a good place to start. It offers a range of tips and advice.Emails from unknown sources, especially those with attachments, may contain a virus to infect your computer and steal details, and so should be left unopened and immediately deleted. It is also possible to download software that can protect a computer from attack. The best known packages are those from Norton, McAfee and Kaspersky. These can be found and downloaded from an online search. It’s also a good idea to update the software regularly. Hackers also find to easier to infect computers through old versions of web browsers, so renewing computer program such as Internet Explorer can make it harder for them.Even so, Murdoch says 80 per cent of viruses go undetected by virus checkers.Some of the simplest ways to protect the security of bank details online are those that many online shoppers ignore. Using different passwords for online accounts, and making the passwords as complex as possible, can prevent hackers who obtain one password from gaining access to a customer’s details elsewhere.Similarly, destroying personal details in letters and on personal files on computers no longer used is always a good idea. The Royal Mail offers a registration service to ensure that, if you move house, old banks statements and personal letters are no longer sent to your old address.When looking at shopping sites, keep an eye out for the ISISI padlock logo on website shopping sites, which shows that a website has been vetted for security. And if making a purchase, consider using the advanced security offered by Visa and Mastercard, which adds another layer of password protrection. Verified By Visa and MasterCard Secure Code require extra Pin numbers and passwords for added security. Paypal, a service that ensures baking details are not handed to retailers, may also prevent your details from being extracted from an online transaction.Finally, using a credit card when shopping might be one of the best precautionary measures available. Items worth between £100 and £30,000 are protected by the credit card company whebn purchased with a card.
468;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Nationwide imposes charges on cards used abroad;;Nationwide has announced that it will start charging customers for using credit and debit cards abroad.The building society says that the decision, which comes just before the summer holdiay season begins, has been forced by wider problems in the economy.From 6 May cash withdrawals and purchases made on a credit card outside of Europe will incur a 0.84 per cent fee. Charges for debit cards will begin on 1 June, and the fee for both will rise to 1 per cent in July.“We have to maintain the balance between offering competitive products whilst ensuring these are sustainable in the long term, particularly in the current economic climate,” said a spokesperson.Customers with a FlexAccount will still be able to take out cash abroad without a charge, and travellers in Europe will not be charged the Visa fee.Nationwide was favoured by savvy travellers as one of the few providers which did not charge for overseas card use, and has promoted the benefit heavily in the past.Using credit cards on overseas trips can be a costly exercise. Flat fees of around £2 are generally levvied for cash withdrawals, and if the card is used to make puchases a currency conversion charge is often charged on top of a fee.Comparison sites say the changes to Nationwide’s account are not entirely surprising, but will be disappointing to millions of customers travelling outside of Europe and already affected by unfavourable exchage rates.There are now very few accounts which allow customers to make purchases abroad without charging a fee.Abbey’s Zero card has no charge on foreign purchases, but will not be available to new customers until its reintroduction in May.The Post Office credit card doesn’t charge commission for overseas spending, and Thomas Cook offers a Visa card with no exchange rate charge, whcih also provides redeemable “travel pounds” on money spent abroad. These can be used to purchase holodays and insurance from Thomas Cook in the future.

Investors appeared to welcome the group’s aggressive attempts to increase its capital by slashing its dividend and bonus payments.Moody’s rallied 4.8 per cent to $23.19 on better- than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, although the group forecast full-year profit below existing estimates.Credit card groups received a boost after Visa and Mastercard also unveiled better-than-expected earnings. They rallied 9.4 per cent to $53.74 and 14.1 per cent to $159.84, respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.6 per cent at 845.85 to remain within a 65-point intraday trading range that it has not left in the last week. Traders said the market has struggled to find momentum in part because of the uncertainty over the new administration’s plans to deal with the stricken banking sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 8,063.07 and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.1 per cent to 1,546.24.Retail stocks held up relatively well in spite of largely downbeat January sales figures. Overall, same-store sales declined by an average of 1.8 per cent last month, according to Thomson Reuters data, which although glum was nevertheless better than the 2.3 per cent drop that had been expected.Consumer staples – which had led the market lower in the previous session, when the latest batch of glum corporate earnings took in erstwhile defensive food companies – took comfort from Wal-Mart’s sales figures.Shares in the world’s largest retailer rallied 4.6 per cent to $48.56 after the group disclosed that same-store sales rose 2.1 per cent in January, better than expected.However, the gains were limited as the group said it would only issue quarterly rather than monthly sales guidance because of the volatile trading environment.Elsewhere in retail, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brands enjoyed particularly positive market reaction to their figures, up 10 per cent to $19.98 and 6.9 per cent to $8.40, respectively.The leading indices opened lower after US Department of Labor data showed unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped last week to a fresh 26-year high. Initial jobless claims increased to 626,000 from an upwardly revised figure of 591,000 the previous week.Investors will keep a close eye on the much-anticipated non-farm payroll report due for release on Friday.Elsewhere, homebuilders did well, up 5.4 per cent overall, helped by Senate approval of expanded tax credit plans for home buyers.Better-than-expected fourth-quarter results from Cigna, up 18.7 per cent to $21.39, gave the health insurance sector a boost.Meanwhile, technology came under early pressure following results from network equipment maker Cisco. Although headline earnings for the latest quarter were better than expected, investors focused on a forecast that was well below expectations.Dell lost 3.7 per cent to $9.43 after JPMorgan downgraded its recommendation on the stock to “underweight”.However, the sector rallied with the wider market and finished 2.2 per cent higher. Cisco closed up 3.2 per cent to $16.35 in volatile trade.The material and energy sectors were the best performing of the day, helped by strength in commodity markets.

470;V;Visa Inc;2009-02-05T19:07:35Z;Slow economy curtails credit card use;;US consumers dramatically cut back their credit card spending in the fourth quarter, according to results from credit card lenders and payment processors, as rising unemployment and a slowing economy inspired increasingly cautious spending habits.MasterCard, the second- largest payment processor after Visa, said yesterday that spending volumes from US holders of their branded credit cards fell by 11.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008 year on year.Consumers were increasingly switching to debit cards, the processor said, and not buying expensive items.Bob Selander, chief executive of MasterCard, said: “Consumers feel they have a level of control with debit. It is their own money, not the bank’s, but they can still keep track of their spending and manage it electronically.”Visa said yesterday that growth in credit card use was slowing, offset by greater debit card use as consumers spent more conservatively.Byron Pollitt, chief financial officer, said consumers were also spending less per transaction, but the number of transactions continued to grow.He said the economy would “continue to have an effect on dollar payment volumes in the US and internationally for at least the next two to three quarters”.Fourth-quarter earnings reports from credit card lenders JPMorgan, Citi and Bank of America showed a steeper than expected drop in card volumes: down 8 per cent, 15 per cent and 13 per cent year on year, respectively.As cautious consumers rein in their spending, credit card lenders such as JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America face reduced revenues at a time when the slowing economy has resulted in higher credit losses.Lenders are suffering from record late payments and soaring defaults as unemployment rises.Credit card write-offs could reach 9 per cent by the end of 2009, according to analysts at Fitch.Credit card lending has historically accounted for between 15 and 25 per cent of pre-tax income at these banks.Payment processors Visa and MasterCard, which do not lend directly to consumers but take a fee for processing card transactions, have been able to maintain their profitability as consumers worldwide have sustained a secular shift from using cash toward making electronic payments.In the US, consumers have cut their spending to cope with the recession and are spending substantially less on their credit cards, but use of debit cards has grown.Both processors have also seen dramatic growth in the number of cards issued under their brands, particularly in emerging markets such as India and the Middle East.At Visa, this trend contributed to a 35 per cent increase in fiscal first-quarter profit – net income was $574m, or 74 cents per share, for the three months to December 31.Total cards carrying the Visa brand rose 10 per cent globally to 1.7bn and total payment transactions jumped 13 per cent to 14.5bn.MasterCard reported that fourth-quarter net income fell 21 per cent year on year.
471;V;Visa Inc;2009-01-20T18:08:22Z;Agreement closer on European card charges;;Visa Europe is coming closer to agreement with European antitrust regulators over the long-running problem of transaction charges on debit and credit cards, executives indicated on Tuesday.Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe’s chief executive, said his company was in a “very constructive dialogue” with the European Commission and he definitely expected an agreement in 2009, although he declined to be more precise. Mr Ayliffe’s comments were considerably more positive than in the past.The problem centres on interchange fees paid between banks that service vendors and banks servicing cardholders.More than a year ago, regulators in Brussels found that Mastercard was breaching EU competition rules by charging excessively high interchange fees on cross-border transactions – an outcome cheered by retailers and consumer groups.Mastercard, which claimed that the fees were vital to facilitating transactions, launched an appeal against the decision, which is still outstanding.Competition officials stressed at the time that the Mastercard decision did not mean that all multilateral interchange fees were illegal. Nevertheless, when an exemption enjoyed by Visa also expired, it, too, became in embroiled in talks with the commission over what kind of new charging structure would be acceptable under competition rules.Mr Ayliffe said the aim was to find a long-term solution to the dispute and that the talks centred on agreeing a core underlying business model.The issue has much wider implications. This is partly because national competition regulators in Europe have also been investigating the legality of interchange fees on domestic transactions.But it is also because of the EU’s desire to create a single euro payment area so that electronic payments made across the eurozone are as straightforward as those made within a single country.Officials have been keen to encourage a European debit card payment network to rival schemes operated by Visa and Mastercard – but banks have been reluctant to commit without more regulatory clarity on the interchange fee issue.
472;V;Visa Inc;2009-01-19T22:41:16Z;Visa Europe sees spending rise;;Spending on Visa credit and debit cards in Europe increased by 10 per cent last year in spite of the economic slump that hit many large economies.Visa Europe, the bank-owned group that is separate from its listed US counterpart, on Monday said consumers spent a total of €882bn ($1,160bn) on all Visa cards last year, an increase of 10.3 per cent over the previous 12 months.The figures suggest that the financial crisis and economic slowdown, which undermined confidence in banks in several European countries, has only had a limited effect on the growing use of cards for purchases.However, Visa Europe signalled it had seen a slowdown in the final quarter of of 2008. It estimates that spending grew by just 5 per cent in the three months to December, compared with year-on-year growth of more than 8 per cent in each of the two previous quarters.Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe’s chief executive, said the group had also noticed a significant slowdown in spending on international travel in September and October. The vast majority of travel spending tends to be booked through credit and debit cards.Visa Europe also suffered a €250,000 hit after it was forced to step in and guarantee transactions involving Singer & Friedlander, which collapsed into administration following the banking crisis in Iceland.The total number of transactions increased 11 per cent to 15.7bn last year as debit and credit cards continued to replace cash and cheques. Card operators such as Visa Europe have benefited from the growing shift to online shopping, where virtually all transactions are paid for using a card.However, spending growth on credit cards was just 7.1 per cent, compared with 10.9 per cent on debit cards, possibly reflecting consumers’ increased reluctance to borrow. The number of credit cards in circulation increased by 1.5 per cent to 121.3m, while the number of debit cards rose 7.1 per cent to 227.3m.The growth of online shopping has led to increased fraud on remote transactions, where the buyer does not have to produce a physical card. This has offset the sharp decline in fraud following the introduction of “chip-and-pin” technology, which requires cardholders to supply a secret number rather than a signature.Visa Europe’s revenues were €673m, up from €583m in 2007. Profits were affected by the proceeds of the initial public offering of Visa Inc, which boosted Visa Europe’s pre-tax surplus to €2.47bn, compared with €65m in 2007.The vast majority of the proceeds were distributed to the banks that control Visa Europe, although the group will also use some of the proceeds to boost its capital and reserves.
473;V;Visa Inc;2009-01-16T18:39:44Z;Deal of the Week Thomas Cook credit card;;What’s the deal?A credit card combining travel rewards with no foreign exchange costs on overseas spending.Thomas Cook’s Visa card is one of the few cards not to carry an exchange rate “loading” – typically cards have hidden currency charges of up to 2.75 per cent.Cardholders also receive “Travel Pounds” on spending abroad and in the UK at the rate of 1 per cent of transaction value. Spending in Thomas Cook shops earns double Travel Pounds.Travel Pounds are redeemable against anything sold by Thomas Cook, including holidays, flights, car hire, foreign exchange and travel insurance. Rewards can also be used at the Going Places chain.The card is interest-free for the first three months for purchases from Thomas Cook. Currency can be bought free of interest and commission, while Thomas Cook holidays don’t attract the normal credit card booking fee.Is this good?It’s the only credit card with the double benefit of no fees and travel rewards on overseas spending.Thomas Cook sells about 20 holiday brands, including Elegant Resorts and Neilson. Travel Pounds can also be redeemed against late deals and special offers. For those not wanting to book travel through Thomas Cook, the rewards can be swapped for currency in its shops.What’s the catch?To some reward collectors, Thomas Cook’s travel range may not appeal. And, at a time of heavy discounting by travel companies, there may be better holiday deals elsewhere.Travel Pounds are also not redeemable online yet.What’s the alternative?Credit cards from Nationwide, Abbey and the Post Office also have no foreign exchange loadings. And Nationwide’s debit card allows currency to be withdrawn from overseas ATMs at no charge.How do I find out more?www.thomascook.com
474;V;Visa Inc;2009-01-12T19:42:15Z;Land of Leather runs out of support;;Land of Leather fell into administration on Monday as the lossmaking sofa chain gave up efforts to support itself and failed to get its bank to throw it a lifeline.The company, which has appointed Deloitte as administrator, said it had been stymied by “exceptionally difficult trading conditions and the lack of liquidity in the banking system”. Its bank, Barclays, refused an application for a loan of about £10m on Monday.Lee Manning, joint administrator at Deloitte, said there were a small number of prospective buyers but it was unlikely that any would want all 109 Land of Leather stores. Some of its 1,060 employees would lose their jobs, he added.“In this market it is difficult to find trade buyers,” Mr Manning said. “Retail is in a very difficult place.” Not many people would want “something as specialised as this business”.Land of Leather is the latest in a line of retailers bloodied by the recession, including MFI, Sofa Workshop and Whittards. But unlike many high street peers, Land of Leather was debt free and needed to generate only enough cash to pay staff and bills. This became increasingly difficult after sales of expensive sofas plunged last year, along with the housing market and consumer confidence.It came close to running out of money at Christmas when it faced a £6m rent bill. It negotiated extra time from landlords and pinned its hopes on the January sales. Three days into the sales, trading was about 40 per cent below the same period last year and the company asked Barclays for a loan to see it through the next 18 months.Last week some landlords sent bailiffs into stores, building the pressure on Land of Leather. “Obviously it didn’t help the situation,” said Mr Manning. “As soon as one or two broke ranks, the trickle was going to become a flood.”The company started preparing for possible administration on Boxing Day. It set up a trust in which to put customers’ cash deposits and payments made through non-Visa debit cards, safeguarding the money of the 20,000 people who have not yet received furniture. But customers who paid with cash or non-Visa debit cards before December 26 are not protected.The shares traded at 3p before being suspended.
475;V;Visa Inc;2009-01-08T21:04:22Z;Big names wait in wings for end to IPO drought;;Trying to raise money in the public equity markets has, for most of the past 18 months, been very challenging. Those hoping for an end to the drought – which spread even as Visa staged the largest ever float by a US company with a $17.9bn offering last March – are likely to be disappointed.With equity markets still displaying heightened volatility, and as scandal and woe in the financial and corporate worlds continue to dominate the news, companies have decided to put any plans to go public on ice.“It makes no sense for any company, large or small, to go public any time soon in this climate. And even if the broader stock market starts to turn upward, the IPO market will likely languish several months behind, at least, before it follows suit,” says Tim Walker of Hoover’s, which conducts research on IPOs.Companies including private equity giant KKR and Italian luxury goods brand Prada last year delayed their IPO plans, while others, such as AMC Entertainment and Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, scrapped their plans to go public.Analysts at Bernstein Research said they did not expect the US IPO market to bottom until 2010. “We expect IPO volumes to fall another 25 per cent annually in 2009 (after the 45 per cent decline in 2008), followed by a 10 per cent decline in 2010,” they said recently.Bernstein said this would have a knock-on effect on equity underwriting – one of the highest margin businesses on Wall Street – for which clients generally pay an underwriter an average of 325 basis points and for smaller transactions up to 700 basis points to price and distribute a new equity.Companies seeking capital are more likely to be ones already public, as they can conduct secondary offerings. Several secondary offerings are expected across the world in the coming weeks, including the planned $7.7bn secondary offering next week by Lloyds TSB, the UK bank. Indeed, given the continued constraints in debt markets, there is an incentive for companies to launch secondary share issues, if they feel they can get them away. Scottish & Southern Energy, the UK utility, raised £479m in a successful share placing earlier this week.European bankers also say IPO activity is unlikely to return to normal levels until late 2009 at the earliest, after European IPOs suffered a dismal fourth quarter, their worst in five years, according to PwC.In November, the privatisation of Deutsche Bahn, one of the world’s largest transport groups, was postponed due to market turmoil. The German government originally hoped to raise up to €6bn by selling a quarter of the state railway operator. A revival of this deal could prove a key test of market sentiment.But the consensus is that a recovery in IPO activity can come only with a significant improvement in buyer appetite.“The biggest factor in the market is fear, and that has given the market for IPOs a new dimension. Many investors have suffered severe principal erosion in the past 18 months, so they’re incredibly wary of losing more money if the market worsens,” says Vis Raghavan, head of international capital markets at JPMorgan.All agreed that the first green shoots of IPO activity in Europe would spring from large companies in defensive sectors, such as utilities, telecoms and healthcare. Emmanuel Gueroult, head of European equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley said: ”When the IPO market does reopen, it will be with solid,cash-generative, defensive assets - what you might call ‘predictable’ companies. Because that’s what investors will be looking for: safety and visibility.”The timing of any recovery remained uncertain. Edward Law, co-head of western Europe equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank, says: “There’s a three- to four-month lag between the decision to push ahead with an IPO, versus the IPO actually being launched. Will market conditions be supportive enough by the end of the summer for the preparation stage to begin? That’s very difficult to answer.”The situation in emerging markets is also difficult, with bankers predicting that any recovery will trail the resumption of IPO activity in the US and western Europe.Craig Coben, managing director of European equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch, notes: “Some emerging markets proved themselves to be insufficiently liquid at the time when investors most needed liquidity. When investors wanted an exit in the midst of the financial turmoil, they couldn’t necessarily get out, and I think that provoked a secular change in investors’ behaviour.”In Asia-Pacific (including Australia and Japan) bankers and analysts are also bracing for a tough year, and there is no chance of beating the record $106.5bn raised in 2007.Asian stock markets are still about half the level of the peak that marked the end of the bull market. “At this stage you wouldn’t be holding your breath, would you?” says Malcolm Wood, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. “Secondary issues are more likely for some financials that will need to recapitalise. The environment that lends itself to IPOs isn’t there.”However there’s some hope that markets could pick up again during the next few months and could even beat $33.5bn, which Thomson Reuters figures say was raised in Asia-Pacific in 2008.Consultants at PwC this week said that once the impact of Beijing’s stimulus package started to feed through into the wider Chinese economy, there would be more IPOs.“IPOs will follow as confidence returns, but valuations will continue to be a concern – as such the IPO discount demanded will continue to widen,” says Les Holland, Citigroup’s head of equity syndicate for Asia in Hong Kong. “There is a large pipeline of names, though, from countries and sectors and timing will be crucial to take advantage of windows of opportunity.”
476;V;Visa Inc;2008-12-28T23:20:51Z;China knocked off IPOs top slot;;Chinese stock exchanges raised just $22bn in initial public offerings in 2008. The slowdown means China will not finish the year as the leading centre for IPOs, falling behind New York for the first time since 2005.Mainland companies last year raised $109bn on global exchanges, largely in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Forecasters, including Ernst & Young, tipped the same amount to be raised this year.However, according to Dealogic, the data provider, IPOs of Chinese companies this year raised $14.6bn on the mainland and $7.4bn in Hong Kong – the lowest total for three years – plus $1bn on other global exchanges.According to Dealogic, IPOs raised $25.4bn on the New York Stock Exchange, propelled by the $19.8bn listing of Visa in March, while $9.3bn was raised on the London Stock Exchange.A total of 124 Chinese companies listed in 2008 compared with just 17 each in New York and London. The Dealogic figures assume there will be no further IPO activity this year.Dealmakers in China and Hong Kong report pent-up demand for IPOs in 2009, though few expect a return to the heady days of 2007 when buyers bought stakes from owners at large valuation multiples.Kester Ng, JPMorgan’s head of Asia-Pacific equity capital and derivatives markets, said: “IPOs will somewhat return in 2009 but will not experience the levels of 2006 or 2007.“It will be a more subdued market, especially in the earlier part of 2009.”Bankers said investors were likely to focus on secondary capital raisings in Asia, where they could acquire shares in companies such as banks at discounts, before being willing to consider possible new listings.Beijing is expected to try to kickstart the moribund IPO market with the sale of state-owned assets.This year’s four largest Chinese IPOs were of government-owned railway or energy assets, sectors that, with retail, healthcare and technology, are expected to provide further listings next year.“Those companies that could IPO will be mostly larger cap stocks, and those which are leaders in their sectors,” Mr Ng said.“Small caps are somewhat out of favour, and only the ones with very strong stories will be able to list.”
477;V;Visa Inc;2008-12-22T23:05:08Z;Emerging markets bear brunt of equity flight;;Global initial public offerings in 2008 tumbled to their lowest level in five years as investors shunned equity markets, leaving many listed companies hoping to tap their shareholders for cash in the new year.The volume of new companies coming to market with IPOs plunged 72 per cent to $82.8bn, down from $299.4bn in 2007, according to data from Dealogic.Meanwhile, total equity issuance, excluding the largely closed Saudi and Chinese A-share market, fell 33 per cent to $632.8bn in 2008 compared with $943.8bn in 2007. Emerging markets bore the brunt of the change, with equity issuance in the Bric economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China diving 68 per cent to $83.3bn from a high of $259.8bn in 2007.By contrast, equity capital market volumes in North America only fell by 4 per cent to $264.6bn, with the credit card group Visa breaking records with a $19.7bn IPO – the largest in US history. Globally, IPO issuers raised just $11.5bn in the second half of the year as equity markets plunged. There were 287 IPOs either withdrawn or postponed in 2008 compared to 160 in 2007 as many companies put expansion plans on ice.Struggling banks seeking to plug holes in their balance sheets and improve their capital ratios made up the bulk of global equity issuance, accounting for 40 per cent of volumes in 2008, up from just 11 per cent in 2007.The financial sector raised $255.5bn of capital, spread between 215 deals, with a record $108.1bn raised in the second quarter of the year.In the coming year, bankers believe that, as the pain from the financial sector ripples through the wider economy, companies in other sectors will be forced to come to the equity markets cap in hand.“There will be continued issuance by banks and insurers and the malice seen in the financials space this year will spread to corporates, where we expect to see an uptick in rights issues,” said Viswas Raghavan, head of international capital markets at JPMorgan.Matthew Koder, co-head of global capital markets at UBS, said that not only banks and insurers, but real estate companies and those in the hard-hit engineering and industrial sectors, are also set to make cash-calls on shareholders.

JPMorgan Chase sank 10.7 per cent to $29.94 after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, told CNBC Television the bank has endured a “terrible” December.Real estate investment trusts sustained particularly heavy losses. The FTSE REITS index sank 15.5 per cent and came under pressure from a bearish Citigroup note on the banking sector.“We now forecast a severe credit cycle in commercial and commercial real estate,” the analysts said.XL Capital, which sank 33 per cent on Wednesday to the lowest level since the company went public, fell a further 11.8 per cent to $3.44. The insurer said it expected to report losses of at least $200m from its alternative investment portfolio and appointed Goldman Sachs to “explore value-enhancing opportunities”.Visa was one of the bright spots for much of the day after the credit card group reiterated earnings forecasts for next year, but it too succumbed to stand 2 per cent lower at $52.09 by the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 2.9 per cent at 873.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.2 per cent lower at 8,565.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.7 per cent weaker at 1,507.88.Advances in oil stocks had helped the wider market stay broadly flat for much of a session as crude rose sharply ahead of the Opec meeting next week.However, the sector finished lower after a heavy sell-off into the close. Exxon Mobil, at one point on course for its highest close since August, finished 0.1 per cent lower at $80.02.Elsewhere, glum economic data, downbeat corporate outlooks and signs that political wrangling could delay a bail-out of the ailing car industry held the market back.General Motors and Ford fell 10.4 per cent to $4.12 and 10.8 per cent to $2.90, respectively, amid fears that Republican critics could scupper $14bn in emergency loans to the industry.“The risk of Senate non-passage remains substantial,” wrote JPMorgan’s car manufacturing analysts in a note to clients.Meanwhile, the number of new workers filing claims for unemployment benefits jumped more than forecast last week to a 26-year high, according to the Labor Department. The figures came after traders were shocked by last week’s non-farm payrolls figures, which showed the biggest drop in 34 years.Meanwhile, industrial stocks suffered following a glut of gloomy news from companies in the sector.Reduced earnings guidance from Cummins and Stanley Works pushed shares in the pair down 7.1 per cent to $24.92 and 5.9 per cent to $32.30, respectively. The sector was one of the worst performing, down 4.2 per cent overall.Consumer stocks also performed badly. Among the heaviest losses, Urban Outfitters sank 20.6 per cent to $14.98 after the clothing and housewares retailer warned sales could worsen over the crucial festive season.Costco lost 3 per cent to $52.06 even after the warehouse chain said quarterly profit rose slightly, as strong results from its petrol stations helped the figures.Lorillard, down 3.9 per cent to $58.70, was among the losers in tobacco stocks after Goldman Sachs downgraded its view of the sector to “neutral”.Goldman analysts warned that a probable increase in excise tax could push volumes down 7 per cent next year.
479;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Credit card fraud;;"American Express deployed the “don’t leave home without it” catchline to flog its credit cards. But be careful your plastic does not leave home without you. “Fraud abroad” is rising, according to Apacs, the UK payments association. While card fraud in UK retailers fell by two thirds from 2004 to 2007, thanks to the introduction of chip and pin technology, misuse of UK cards abroad more than doubled.Fraudsters previously relied on cheaply copying cards using information contained in the card’s magnetic strip. They struggle, though, to counterfeit cards containing chips, which usually require a personal identification number. Swiping a mag-strip, however, remains enough to go spending in countries yet to introduce the new system.The primary offender is the US. European countries will fully introduce chip and pin by 2010. Canada is set to follow, as are countries from Asia-Pacific to South America. By contrast, the US shows little interest, as yet. Hence, last year’s 50 per cent jump in fraud committed on UK cards in the US.There are various explanations for this lackadaisical approach. The US system, whereby payments are instantly authenticated online, may have reduced the perceived need, although it does little to stop the fraudsters. The lack of industry-level fraud data in the US may also make the benefits of change unclear. Perhaps, given that UK losses were “just” £535m in 2007, compared with the £372bn total spent, the numbers are not sufficiently shocking to spur US banks and retailers into action.That is short-sighted. Globally, Mastercard and Visa are well used to the conversion process. But with no central body to crack heads together, both may be reluctant to irritate banks by moving first. The US hold-out means mag-strips on cards must remain to cater to global travellers – good news for crooks. Credit card fraud has gone global. The response to it should too.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

480;V;Visa Inc;2008-11-14T01:45:33Z;Olympics sponsors unite to boost influence;;Sponsors backing the London Olympics are to club together to increase their clout and maximise the value of their investments, amid signs of disenchantment at their treatment by games organisers.The chairmen and chief executives of the 2012 games’ international and domestic sponsors will meet at a networking event hosted by Gordon Brown in December.The gathering is being billed as the “Chairmen’s Club” – an opportunity to bring together businesses that employ more than 2m people and have a combined turnover of £588bn ($874bn).It is expected to become an annual event, with sponsors keen to ensure they are seen as active participants in the games’ preparations rather than passive bankrollers.Privately, some domestic sponsors of the 2012 games that have been signed up by Locog, the London organising committee complain that they were largely ignored by Locog officials in Beijing during the 2008 games. They are also expecting Locog to try to extract more in-kind help for games preparations.International sponsors, who are long-term global partners of the International Olympic Committee, also want to ensure that London delivers a far better return from the event itself than Beijing produced. Sponsors believe their facilities were poorly attended in the first week of the Beijing games.Those expected to attend the inaugural meeting include the leading figures of the IOC’s international sponsors, which include Coca-Cola, GE, Visa, McDonald’s and Samsung.The meeting will also be attended by the top brass from those domestic sponsors so far signed up by Locog, including Lloyds TSB, BT, BA, EDF Energy and Adidas.Locog said its nine sponsors were “a very important part of our team”, adding: “We have a strong relationship with all our partners and are as committed to maximising the value of their partnerships as they are.” Locog has raised £430m of its £650m target from domestic sponsors.Although the sponsors’ meeting will take place at Number 10 and the prime minister will participate, it is understood that the impetus for the gathering came from the sponsors.The government ran into difficulty over its 2012 commitment after Tessa Jowell, the Olympics minister, told leisure industry chief executives on Tuesday that the bid for the games would never have been made had the economic climate been foreseen.She issued a hasty clarification, saying she was expressing what she thought would have been the commonly held view rather than one she shared herself.
481;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa warns of tough three years ahead;;Visa reported better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter on Wednesday on higher transaction volumes, but said it expected revenue for the next three years to be at the low end of previous guidance amid the global economic slowdown.The credit card processor reported a net loss of $356m, or 45 cents a share, for the three months ended September 30, its third quarter as a public company. That compared with a $1.66bn loss a year earlier.However, excluding litigation reserves and restructuring charges, earnings were 58 cents a share for the quarter, and $2.25 a share for the full year 2008.Visa and MasterCard are sidestepping the rising customer defaults at other card companies such as American Express and Capital One because they collect fees to process payments between financial institutions but do not take the risk of making loans to consumers.“In the face of a tough economic environment in the US and internationally, the relative resiliency of the Visa business model was in evidence,” said Joe Saunders, chief executive of Visa.Lenders have reported declining profits as they put aside more money for future losses amid rising US unemployment and a battered housing market.Payment processers such as Visa and MasterCard are exposed to the potential for lower overall spending volumes as consumers tighten their belts but, even as the US economy slows, the growing adoption of card-based payments in the US and overseas has helped contribute to growth.Revenues rose 17 per cent to $1.71bn as spending on Visa cards climbed 15 per cent to $699bn and transaction volume rose 19 per cent. The number of Visa-branded cards rose 12 per cent worldwide to 1.6bn. Mastercard is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings next week.While the rate of growth in credit card transactions slowed in the quarter, Visa said the rate of growth in debit payments continued to accelerate. Debit payment processing represented more than half of Visa’s payment transactions worldwide.“Debit is particularly important to our results in the current environment, as that product is rooted in everyday spend behaviour which has proven to be less susceptible to economic fluctuations and continues to grow,” said Mr Saunders.Shares in Visa fell 0.37 per cent to $50.50 in after hours trading yesterday. The stock has fallen more than 40 per cent from its peak in May.Visa and MasterCard this week reached a $2.75bn settlement of a lawsuit brought by Discover Financial that alleged anti-competitive practices. That followed an earlier $4bn settlement the two companies reached with American Express over similar allegations. Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted any liability as part of the settlements.

As the session drew to a close, the market fell by a jaw-dropping 5 per cent within 10 minutes.The S&P 500 finished 1.1 per cent lower at 930.09 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.8 per cent at 8,990.96. The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,657.21.Contributing to the confusion, Dow Jones reported that General Electric, which has not provided guidance for 2009, aimed to keep profits next year at the same level as this year even if revenue declined by between 10 and 15 per cent. The shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $19.20. After the close, GE said the report was “out of context” and “inaccurate”.Observers were divided as to the impact of the Fed’s 50 basis point cut, which was already priced in to the equity market.“What’s really driving the market are the other programmes that are breaking the log jams,” said Doug Roberts, strategist at Channel Capital Research, with reference to government measures to shore up the banking sector.Other recent monetary policy interventions had done little to help sentiment, but Joe Cusick, market analyst at optionsXpress, said: “This one’s a little bit different.”Fears of widespread financial collapse that trumped all other concerns had dissipated, he added, and a move to lower the cost of borrowing was likely now to have a tangible effect.Procter & Gamble lost 3.5 per cent to $60.99 after the consumer products group met analyst earnings estimates but still lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings guidance. Citigroup maintained its “hold” rating on the stock.Kraft and Kellogg fell 1.4 per cent to $28.47 and 1.3 per cent to $50.02, respectively, even after price increases helped the food groups beat forecasts.Telecoms was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500, down 3.3 per cent overall. Investors were concerned by a sharp drop in basic video subscribers at Comcast, which dropped 9.9 per cent to $15.28, although the group reported better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Smaller rival Qwest slid 7.7 per cent to $2.40 after lowering its guidance for the year.Motorola fell 6.5 per cent to $5.46 ahead of results due on Friday. Reports said that the phone group would streamline its cellphone division and cut thousands of jobs.Energy was the biggest sectoral winner, up 3.6 per cent as oil prices edged higher. Solar energy stocks rallied after First Solar, which gained 1.5 per cent to $115.75, entered the residential market with a deal to supply modules to SolarCity, an installation company.Education stocks rose, helped by better-than-expected figures from Apollo Group, the parent company of the University of Phoenix, which rallied 10.4 per cent to $65.01.Aetna tumbled 8.1 per cent to $25.55 after the health insurer trimmed its forecast for the year. Fears over the prospect of writedowns and a possible capital-raising have driven the sector down sharply in recent months.Corning fell 8 per cent to $10.51 after the glass and ceramics maker missed analysts’ estimates on lower demand for televisions.General Motors rose 8.2 per cent to $6.76 after Reuters reported that the car group had resolved “major issues” with Chrysler owner Cerberus Capital Management over a potential merger.Visa edged up 1.4 per cent to $50.69. After the bell, the credit card group cut its annual revenue growth target, citing a challenging economy and the shares lost 1.2 per cent in after-hours trade.Among a host of insurers to post results after the bell, Prudential Financialdisclosed it swung to a quarterly loss. The shares were down 3.3 per cent at $35.25 and remained flat in after-hours trade.In addition to the rate cut, traders took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and data showing that durable goods orders rose unexpectedly last month.
483;V;Visa Inc;2008-10-28T21:00:21Z;Wall St gains strongly despite grim data;;"US equities soared on Tuesday, rebounding from the heavy losses sustained in the previous two sessions as investors snapped up battered stocks in spite of a fresh glut of grim economic data.Throughout the session, swings in the S&P 500 were tightly correlated with moves in the exchange rates of the euro and dollar against the yen. That suggested widespread selling of yen positions had left traders with cash to invest in US stocks.After a wave of buying into the New York close, the S&P 500 finished up 10.8 per cent to 940.50. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 9.5 per cent to 1,649.47 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.9 per cent to 9,065.12.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 16.3 per cent, although at 66.99 continued to indicate heightened levels of distress.The market’s late afternoon surge came even after figures showed consumer confidence slumped to a record low in October, which Ian Shepherdson, of High Frequency Economics, described as “extraordinarily awful.” Separate data showed prices of single-family homes plunged by a record percentage in August.Energy and telecoms were two of the biggest sectoral winners. Exxon Mobil and AT&T were among the biggest blue-chip winners, up 13.3 per cent to $74.86 and 13.2 per cent to $27.61 respectively after analysts at Morgan Stanley highlighted their “defensive” qualities.Relatively well-received results from refiner Valero helped the energy sector. Its shares jumped 11.3 per cent to $16.81.Materials overall gained 12.7 per cent. US Steel’s third-quarter results were also positive and the shares jumped 14.2 per cent to $35.20 even after a downbeat assessment of prospects for the fourth quarter.The financial sector remained volatile, with large swings, particularly in the value of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Despite early losses, Morgan Stanley closed up 10.7 per cent at $15.20 and Goldman shares ended up 0.7 per cent at $93.57.Phil Orlando, strategist at Federated Investors, said sentiment was also helped by the continuing efforts by the US government to implement measures to help the financial sector. “There’s a recognition that these programmes will be successful [in the long term],” he said.Traders also took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and the market is pricing in a 50 basis point interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.Wal-Mart jumped 11.1 per cent to $55.17 after the world’s largest retailer told analysts it was “well-positioned” to deal with a global slump.In industrials, Boeing climbed 15.5 per cent to $48.91 on the prospect of a tentative deal to end a strike.General Motors advanced 14.7 per cent to $6.25 on reports that the hard-hit auto group was pushing for government aid to help a possible merger with
Chrysler.Meanwhile, internet stocks were in focus after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on several in the sector. “We are cautious on US display advertising,” the analysts wrote. “Investors should position their portfolios toward what we see as more sustainable growth in search and fixed-price e-commerce.”Google was up 11.9 per cent to $368.75 after Credit Suisse placed an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $400.Airlines were a key winner, up 4.3 per cent overall. The sector was helped after Calyon upgraded a slew of stocks due to “dramatically falling oil prices and the deep capacity cuts implemented to support ticket prices and revenue, which sharply reduced variable and fixed costs”.Bucking the market’s upward momentum, Whirlpool lost 8.3 per cent to $45.87 after the group slashed its full-year outlook and said it would cut 5,000 jobs by the end of next year.Britannia Bulk Holdings plunged 85.8 per cent to 27 cents after the group said there was a “very high risk” that it would default on a $170m loan.Visa and MasterCard rose 7.3 per cent to $49.97 and 7.7 per cent to $136.01, respectively, after the duo agreed to pay $2.75bn to settle an antitrust lawsuit with

485;V;Visa Inc;2008-10-14T19:24:58Z;Credit cards;;For a while it seemed that neither record commodity prices nor falling wealth could put a dent in American consumers’ propensity to pay with plastic, but the moment of frugal reckoning is now finally here. August had the biggest drop in revolving debt on record and the last several weeks were probably even worse.The fall in spending and rising late credit card payments have naturally weighed on the financial sector. Lately though, companies such as Visa and MasterCard that depend on transaction volumes rather than creditworthiness have been hit nearly as hard as those facing delinquencies. The largest issuers of credit cards are big banks, but they have many other businesses and have gyrated recently on separate concerns. Three that come close to being pure plays on cards while still having credit exposure are Capital One, American Express and Discover Financial Services and they are off by an average of 51 per cent from their 52 week highs. Visa and Mastercard’s drops of 35 and 46 per cent, respectively, are better but still an overreaction.The future of the two big processors lies in developing markets. These have wobbled recently, but if future penetration rates climb anywhere near their expected pace, processor shares still look attractive. In the not-too-distant future, developed market revenue will merely grow in line with nominal output. In the US, for example, cheques and cash already have dropped from three fourths of spending in the early 1990s to a little over a third today. Worldwide though, these represent an $80,000bn untapped market for cards.At around 27 and 20 times prospective earnings, respectively, Visa and Mastercard might seem expensive in a bombed-out financial sector, but they can still grow earnings respectably if revenue rises in the low teens, several percentage points lower than consensus forecasts. Even if global recession looms, plastic cards are one American export with a bright future.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
486;V;Visa Inc;2008-10-05T17:49:50Z;How to lose your best friends;;"The Closing of the American Border
By Edward Alden
Harper $27.95Five of the 19 terrorists who attacked the US on September 11, 2001, had broken US immigration laws. Their leader Mohammed Atta had previously overstayed a visa and should not have been allowed back in. As a Justice Department official put it: “The abuse of US immigration laws was instrumental in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people.” It was not going to happen again.The government set about tightening the rules and their enforcement. Six months after the attacks, Atta’s application for a student visa to take flying lessons was approved, and a letter saying so arrived at the flight-training school in Florida. The story caused a fresh outcry. The agency responsible was purged, shut down and replaced. The rules were tightened again, and zealously enforced.There has not been another attack – and Edward Alden, a former Washington bureau chief for the FT and now a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations, recognises that foreign terrorists find it much harder to get in. The trouble is, so does everybody else, including people that the US needs. On balance, Alden argues, the new regime has done more harm than good even in narrow security terms, to say nothing of the wider human and economic costs. Few who read his compellingly argued and meticulously researched book will be inclined to disagree.The Closing of the American Border tells heart-rending stories of immigrants who have lived for years in the US, maybe serving the country with distinction as doctors or scientists, running businesses and paying their taxes, giving no grounds whatever for suspicion that they may have ties to terrorists, and yet fall foul of the system.They may have come from Pakistan or Somalia or they may be Muslim: that can suffice for them to be denied re-entry if they should leave, while inquiries are undertaken. People guilty of petty infractions of complex immigration rules have been handcuffed, jailed, thrown out and refused permission to return. The system has taken on a cruel and tyrannical character – and understandably so, since it is what America’s voters and politicians appear to want. Pity the immigration officer who gives the next Atta his visa.In recounting the history of the immigration system post-9/11, the book tells of the quarrels within the administration over how to mend it – and how to balance reducing the risk of letting terrorists in while staying open to the skilled immigrants that the country wants and once welcomed. In these debates, as the book explains, the false argument for reducing risk to zero mostly won the day.Alden blames the administration’s single-minded focus on the war on terror. “[T]he way Bush defined the post-9/11 war on terrorism – as a global struggle for survival with a foe he deemed as menacing as Nazi Germany or the nuclear-armed Soviet Union – made a nuanced and proportionate response almost impossible,” he writes. Is that quite right? Terrorists might very well acquire a nuclear weapon, and 9/11 showed that some would have no compunction about using it. One does not need to argue that the terrorist threat has been blown out of proportion to find the country’s current attitude to border security ill-advised. As Alden argues, the approach most likely puts the country at a net disadvantage in the war on terror.First, it misdirects resources. Vanishingly few immigrants are terrorists, so it makes little sense to see immigration policy as part of counterterrorism policy. The effort spent on combing through immigrants, as though each might pose a threat, denies resources to intelligence-gathering and other more purposeful anti-terror efforts.Then there is the economic harm. US companies continually complain that they can no longer hire the best people and bring them in. It is easier to take the work to them by investing abroad. The country has thrived all through its history by attracting the best and brightest of the world. An enfeebled US will find all of its goals – including national security – harder to achieve.Worst of all, it is an approach that loses friends abroad rather than making them. Immigrants come to the US because they admire it – and they find ordinary Americans to be the most welcoming and hospitable people in the world. These visitors become unpaid US ambassadors to friends and families abroad. The government’s institutionalised hostility to immigrants is undoing much of that benefit.Alden quotes a governor who travels abroad to find investors for his state: “When you go to Europe, the whole first half of every meeting is about how they’ve been travelling to the US for 20 years and now they’re treated like criminals by the immigration system.”This is not the price you pay to win the war on terror. It is how you lose it.The writer is an FT columnist"
487;V;Visa Inc;2008-09-26T13:56:07Z;How can internet transactions be better protected?;;The same techniques developed to protect face-to-face transactions should form the basis of greater online security and offers an opportunity for forward-looking financial institutions to differentiate themselves in the market.According to the UK House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, current security levels are not deterring fraudsters from operating online. The committee recommends fast-tracking the introduction of a co-ordinated e-crime law enforcement unit to help combat the problem.Financial institutions and organisations have made concerted efforts in recent years to protect and enhance the security of face-to-face transactions, but the same level of security now needs to be expanded into the online environment.So far, online security strategy has been focused on isolated uses of the internet rather than encompassing the entire online environment. Strengthening the security surrounding online banking has been a particular focus for many UK banks. Barclays, Nationwide and RBS have all distributed card readers to e-banking customers to enhance security. The security is stronger because it relies on a customer having two separate elements in the security process – a physical item (the bank card) and knowledge of something (the Pin).The roll-out of two-factor authentication, or strong authentication, for e-banking in the UK is steadily improving security and showing a return on investment. Barclays says that customers using two-factor authentication for online banking experience no fraud whatsoever. Of course, other devices can be used in place of the smart card reader. Two-factor authentication via the mobile phone is an option which is increasingly being considered and one which is likely to appeal to many customers.Yet, online banking is only a small element of the wider financial activity which takes place online. Riding on the success of two-factor authentication for online banking, security advisors in financial institutions are in a strong position to advocate the business benefits of extending its use to cover the whole online payments space.Card schemes do have extra security methods that address e-commerce fraud. Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode are initiatives that encourage customers to protect transactions by registering an additional password. This enables financial institutions to confirm a cardholder’s identity to the online retailer. However, of the 83m credit and debit cards currently in circulation in the UK, only 20m are registered with either scheme. In addition, as they are password based, they are also still vulnerable to phishing fraud. Despite efforts by Visa and MasterCard, retailers feel that not enough is being done to support them in tackling the epidemic.Such an opportunity should be seized upon by financial institutions that are trying to differentiate their services in an increasingly commoditised and competitive market. Extending online security presents an opportunity for banks to allay consumers’ online fears and boost their brand image at the same time. Stronger security will enable banks to demonstrate to customers that they are reacting to the fraud threat, improving customer retention as a result.The documented increase in fraud attacks involving non face-to-face transactions is a concern which is moving up financial institutions’ list of priorities year-on-year. Combining the financial losses of this type of fraud with the growing consumer impact of security breaches, banks must start taking preventive measures now.The investment in two-factor authentication for online banking is showing promise and should be regarded as a solid platform that can be extended to cover a wider online security strategy.Steve Brunswick works for the Information Systems Security business at Thales
488;V;Visa Inc;2008-09-23T22:56:28Z;Turmoil leaves Kuwait a $270m Citi loss;;Facing domestic pressure over its stakes in troubled US banks, Kuwait’s $200bn sovereign wealth fund on Tuesday took the unusual step of acknowledging losses in Citigroup, one of its most high profile investments.Bader al-Saad, managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority, told al-Arabiya television that the fund had lost $270m in Citi but had made no losses on its investment in Merrill Lynch, which has been bought by Bank of America.In January, KIA invested $5bn in the two US banks.Mr Saad said the global turmoil was creating investment opportunities abroad – including in the US, Europe and Asia – but said the fund was not in the business of bailing out ailing banks.Gulf funds were seen as rushing to the aid of distressed US financials this year but recently there have been questions about their losses and calls in some quarters for sovereign entities to invest domestically. Last week, the KIA began investing in the Kuwaiti stock market to support that exchange, which, like other Gulf markets, has plummeted in recent weeks.Unlike other Gulf states, Kuwait – a US ally – has an active media and parliament renowned for grilling government officials.“There is concern in the market about how sovereign wealth funds may have suffered, there are also questions from parliament about their losses [the statement] is a way of advising the people . . . and . . .a political message,” said a Kuwait-based analyst. “What they were trying to say is our investment strategy is not politically motivated.”Although other Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have no parliament to account to, their early foray into ailing US financials last year and early this year has put them on the defensive.Some Gulf bankers say it is likely that more capital will stay in the region as governments and private investors look to invest in emerging markets closer to home, such as Algeria and Libya. “The global crisis reinforced perceptions that it’s better to keep your money at home,” says one Dubai-based banker.Bankers say that some US investment banks seeking funds in the Gulf recently were rebuffed, amid growing unease about the fate of Wall Street.This is not to say sovereign entities will stop looking at western markets – although they are keen not to be seen to be taking advantage of the west’s ­problems.Mubadala, one of the Abu Dhabi government’s main investment arms, on Tuesday said it had bought a 50 per cent stake in Kor Hotel Groups, a Los Angeles-based company.“I think sovereign wealth funds with lots of liquidity and lots of cash and the consequential backing of a cash-rich government are going to remain active,” said Philipp Lotter, an analyst at Moody’s.“Certainly you are not going to see Mubadala or any other sovereign entity go out and make a bid for a strategic asset just because they happen to be cheap.“They are conscious of the political sensitivities [in the west] . . . But that notwithstanding these entities remain very liquid, highly government supported and will identify investment opportunities as they arise.”

The shares dropped 19.3 per cent to $18.37.The financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as concerns grew over asset sales ahead of banks’ third-quarter earnings season.Washington Mutual – also exposed to the mortgage market – sank 19.9 per cent to $3.30, a day after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and ousted its chief executive. Excluding Lehman, it was the biggest laggard on the S&P 500.Wachovia, among the biggest gainers in the previous session, tumbled 14.5 per cent to $16.24 on Tuesday after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform” and its price target from $18 to $16, due in part to expected higher credit losses.Goldman Sachs slid 4.8 per cent to $161.67 after analysts at Ladenburg Thalmann cut their profit forecast.Visa which along with Chinatrust Financial will replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the Dow Jones Financial Services Titans index, lost 3.7 per cent at $67.49.The wider market reversed Monday’s gains as initial relief faded over the government bail-out of the mortgage guarantors.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index – a measure of investor anxiety of future volatility – reached its highest level since the credit facility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was announced and oil reached its peak in mid-July.By the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 3.4 per cent to 1,224.51, within sight of the closing low for the year hit in mid-July, led by an overall financial sector decline of 6.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,230.73. The Nasdaq was 2.6 per cent lower at 2,209.81.A steeper-than-expected drop in pending home sales also weighed on sentiment, prompting growing worries of a worsening housing slump.The National Association of Realtors index of pending home resales fell 3.2 per cent in July after rising 5.8 per cent the previous month.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse downgraded four homebuilders – Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes, DR Horton and KB Home – from “outperform” to “neutral”. The shares fell 8.4 per cent to $24.26, 8.9 per cent to $14.77, 9.1 per cent to $12.83 and 9 per cent to $21.42, respectively.Another fall in oil prices hit the energy sector as US crude fell more than $3 a barrel after Opec’s meeting in Vienna.The declines were led by Massey Energy, Noble Energy, Valero Energy and National Oilwell Varco, which fell 19.4 per cent at $38.90, 12 per cent at $57.14, 11.8 per cent at $30.51 and 11.5 per cent at $52.92.Material companies also suffered, hit by wider commodity price declines. Nucor and US Steel dropped 9.7 per cent at $42.15, and 13 per cent at $93.69, respectively. AK Steel dropped 16.2 per cent to $33.72 after hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, offloaded 3.1m shares.Amid the gloom, there was the odd bright spot. Oil’s continued retreat afforded at least some comfort to consumer stocks. Sears and Fortune Brands, for example, put on 0.9 per cent to $92.72 and 0.7 per cent to $61.65, respectively.McDonald’s rose 1.2 per cent at $63.19 after a positive August sales update from the fast-food chain.Hewlett-Packard edged up 0.6 per cent to $46.01 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the world’s largest PC manufacturer from “market perform” to “outperform”.However, that failed to lift technology stocks more generally – which have been badly hit in recent sessions – into positive territory. Dell fell 4.3 per cent to $19.30 even after it emerged that founder Michael Dell bought $100m of stock in the computer manufacturer last week.Meanwhile, UAL, parent of United Airlines, continued to suffer losses after a false report surfaced on the internet on Tuesday that the carrier had returned to bankruptcy. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $10.60.
490;V;Visa Inc;2008-09-01T17:31:09Z;Rough market conditions keep IPOs on sidelines;;In mid-March, Halcyon Asset Management, a $11.5bn US hedge fund company, was all set to go public.But as summer set in, Halcyon quietly decided that the uncertainty in the market meant it was better to wait and it cancelled its plans.That is just one of a series of cancelled US stock market offerings so far this year.And September, when activity across the capital markets tends to pick up after an unofficial summer recess, is unlikely to bring a turnround.Market volatility, heightened concerns about inflation, the health of the housing and credit markets, as well as oil price fluctuations are among the factors that have created an environment in which the only tenable option for companies hoping to go public is to wait and hope things get better.In global terms, this year is already shaping up to be the worst since 2003.So far there have been 554 IPOs raising a combined $78bn, less than half the number of deals and total raised for the same period last year, when 1,140 deals globally raised $176bn according to figures from Dealogic, the data provider.US companies have been by far the least active with just 44 coming to market compared with 147 deals involving European companies and 234 involving Asian companies. But even for European and Asian IPOs, the amounts raised are down sharply on recent years.And even those companies that have come to market have struggled, particularly in the US. Renaissance Capital’s IPO Index, which tracks the performance of US IPOs, has fallen over 17.4 per cent so far this year, underperforming the Standard & Poor’s 500 index which is down 12 per cent.There are exceptions, most notably Visa, the largest US IPO, whose shares have rise more than fourfold since their debut in March. Cardionet, the medical device manufacturer and Intrepid Potash, the crop nutrient maker, are other examples of decent post-issue performance.But in those cases where companies have performed well post-IPO, investors can invariably point to a particularly compelling investment opportunity. In the case of Visa for example, credit card companies pass on most of the credit risks to the banks that issue their cards, and so are generally viewed as a sound investment regardless of market conditions.New filings continue to take place and the pipeline for upcoming IPOs on a global basis looks surprisingly healthy.High filing activity has overcome high withdrawal rates, supporting a deal backlog much larger than it was during the 2001 to 2003 IPO drought. As of August 28, the IPO backlog counted 129 companies, compared with just 50 deals at the IPO market’s trough in mid-2003, according to Renaissance Capital, the IPO research company.
491;V;Visa Inc;2008-08-31T22:35:33Z;Atticus principals to be hit where it hurts most;;"For most of the past decade, Atticus Capital has been a force to reckon with in global markets. From its base in New York, the hedge fund, which had more than $20bn of assets under management at its peak last year, helped dictate the course of mega-mergers and corporate strategy at some of the world’s biggest companies – and made a fortune in the process.Founded by Tim Barakett, a Canadian, in 1995, the young manager soon hired Nathaniel Rothschild, son of Lord Jacob Rothschild, to act as co-chairman and draw on his connections to raise money. He subsequently poached David Slager, a British-educated Dutch trader, from Goldman Sachs, who launched a European fund that grew rapidly to pass the original Global fund Mr Barakett runs.All three of them went on to make personal fortunes in the bull market, which ended in summer last year. Mr Barakett and Mr Slager were estimated by Trader Monthly magazine to have made $250m-$300m each last year, with Mr Rothschild adding to his family’s wealth with a similar income. The three of them, together with other staff, have more than $1.4bn invested in the $14bn fund, with Mr Barakett and Mr Slager having the vast bulk of their personal wealth tied up in Atticus.When the credit crunch hit in August last year, Atticus was caught out. The firm had a $1bn position in Britain’s Barclays Bank, where it was publicly opposing efforts by John Varley, chief executive, to buy Dutch rival ABN Amro – a deal that Barclays lost to Royal Bank of Scotland – as well as major unhedged holdings across many large companies. Mr Slager’s fund plunged more than 10 per cent in the month, its worst result yet, as banking shares, and Barclays, tumbled. Still, investors were unconcerned. The funds made back all their losses over the next two months, and the European fund ended 2007 up 28 per cent after fees – not a patch on the 44 per cent and 63 per cent gains of the previous two years, but still a phenomenal result for such a large fund.This year, investors have been more worried. The fund’s low levels of short-selling, which can hedge against falling markets, and its enormous position in Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the stock exchanges, has hammered its results. Mr Slager has recorded his seven worst months since the credit crisis hit, and at the end of August was down 32.9 per cent this year. Mr Barakett has fared slightly better, but was still down 25 per cent.Now the fund and its top executives are braced for at least a year without bonuses, as Atticus will receive no performance fees – the bulk of its income – until the funds have made back their losses – requiring gains of 50 per cent for Mr Slager and 33 per cent for Mr Barakett.“Perhaps one concludes that the time is over for them,” said one investor. However, other investors said the dire results over the past 12 months were just a “natural” give-back of some earlier profits. Clients who put money with Mr Slager when his fund launched in 2001, for example, have still made more than three and a half times their money, turning $10m at launch into almost $37m.Nicola Horlick, in the latest report to shareholders in Bramdean, the London-listed investment fund she runs, said its holding in Atticus European was expected to be volatile, and was kept small as a result. “Given that the manager maintains concentrated positions, the heavy losses in declining markets are not surprising,” she wrote.Still, this year’s losses have been galling for Atticus, which believes it has picked strong companies in sectors which are fundamentally sound.“We continue to be disappointed by what we believe is an over-reaction in specific themes to concerns about growth,” it said in a report to Atticus European investors last month.“These valuations indicate persistent fear, and reflect the willingness of many investors to de-risk their portfolios uneconomically,” it wrote. “Historically, these conditions have indicated the wrong time to sell equities, and we believe that remains true today.”The latest regulatory filings show Atticus running with three big investment themes at the end of June: mining and oil/energy, including a $1bn holding in ConocoPhillips; financials and stock exchanges, including more than €1bn ($1.47bn) of Deutsche Börse, and a combined $1bn in Visa and Mastercard; and US rail, with $1bn of Union Pacific and another $1bn in Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern. The hedge fund focuses on large companies, unlike many rivals, taking very large, concentrated positions. It originally started out following the “event-driven” strategy: buying cheap stocks where a corporate event could provide a catalyst for a jump in the price.As it grew bigger and more powerful it began to provide the catalyst itself, pushing management to take action it believed would boost the stock. In the case of Phelps Dodge, the miner, it even hired its own investment bankers to find a buyer, ahead of its sale last year to Freeport-McMoRan. It halved its $1.1bn equity stake in the second quarter, although it also bought $200m worth of options.Atticus has come under scrutiny for its links to The Children’s Investment Fund, an aggressive London activist hedge fund run by Chris Hohn, a Harvard friend of Mr Barakett.The two have frequently bought the same stocks or taken the same general views – including their focus on US rail – and are the two largest shareholders in Deutsche Börse.They worked together to prevent the exchange’s purchase of the London Stock Exchange, although subsequently they have diverged in views, particularly with regard to ABN, where Mr Hohn was pushing the Dutch bank to sell, while Atticus was trying to stop Barclays from buying.Concerns that they could be seen as acting together, highlighted by an inconclusive investigation by the German regulator, were behind Mr Hohn’s resignation last year as a director of RIT Capital, the listed Rothschild investment trust, where Mr Rothschild is also a director. RIT is an investor in Atticus, and the hedge fund rents its London office from RIT."
492;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US shoppers turn away from credit;;Middle-class US consumers are increasingly leaving their credit cards at home when they go shopping, extending a trend first shown by Wal-Mart’s low-income shoppers last year, and adding to the pressures on US retailers’ sluggish sales.Mainstream retailers are reporting that shoppers are opting for debit cards or cash instead of credit cards as they face tighter credit limits, illustrating how the wider credit crunch is being transferred to main street spending.Target, the discounter with over 1,500 stores across the US, said last week that it had seen the share of total payments made using credit cards fall for the first time ever in its second quarter, while the use of debit cards continued to rise.The retailer said the resulting slowing of credit use has in turn hurt its sales performance – which saw a slight decline in sales at stores open for at least a year during the quarter.“Clearly the aggregate access that our guests have to credit cards…is one of the issues that is determining our same-store sales performance in the current environment,” Doug Scovanner, Target’s chief operating officer, told investors.Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer whose sales fell 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the six months to August 1, also reported an increase in the mix of cash and debit card use during the latest quarter.Kohl’™s, the budget department store chain, reported an increase in the use of its Kohl’s credit card, which rewards loyal shoppers with monthly savings.But it said the share of payments made by regular bank credit cards and cash had both declined, while it also saw a rise in debit card use. The retailers’ experiences on the shop floor reflect the broader slowdown in the growth of credit.MasterCard, the payments network, said US credit card use was virtually unchanged in the second quarter, with a slight 0.7 per cent increase in total payments, against a 16 per cent increase in debit card use.Visa’s US credit card payments increased 8 per cent, while debit card use increased by 16 per cent.In addition to accepting bank credit cards, most US retailers also issue their own charge cards and co-branded credit cards in partnership with issuing banks.Retailers use these own-brand cards to promote customer loyalty through offering discounts to card holders, and to gather data on their customers’ shopping habits.However, both banks and retailers have been tightening the terms both on their existing cards and on new applicants, in part to reflect declining credit scores that are the result of the increasing economic pressures on their customers.Lowe’s said the share of payments using its own-brand credit card fell 100 basis points in the second quarter to 22 per cent.Target, which co-issues store-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, has followed other card issuers by increasing interest charges on existing accounts and what it describes as “aggressive reduction of credit lines and significant tightening of all aspects of our underwriting”.Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, says it has seen “significant erosion” of credit scores which led it to reduce some credit limits on existing card holders whose cards accounted for almost 30 per cent of its sales last year.Wesley McDonald, Kohl’s chief financial officer, noted that while its charge card performed strongly in the second quarter, accounting for 44 per cent of sales, the rate at which it is issuing new cards is slowing.“Part of that is just obviously with people having more economic difficulties, their credit scores are falling across the country,” he told investors this month.
493;V;Visa Inc;2008-08-22T15:56:54Z;Deal of the week;;What’s the deal?A current account from Cater Allen, the private banking arm of Santander, where balances can be held in euros and dollars as well as sterling.The Cater Allen Private Bank Account has a minimum opening balance of £5,000 (or €10,000 or $10,000) but there is no requirement for further assets to be held with the bank.Claiming to offer “the service expected of a private bank”, including a dedicated account handling team, the account comes with a “deferred-debit” Visa card that allows no-cost currency withdrawals from overseas cashpoints.The card can also be used for overseas spending, in which case funds are only debited at the end of the month, potentially enabling users to earn interest in the meantime.Accountholders can switch between euros, dollars and sterling at no explicit charge, at rates 1 per cent worse than wholesale foreign exchange levels. This allows users to move into currencies when rates look attractive, or to protect against the prospect of further falls.Interest rates vary up to a maximum of 3 per cent on high balances of €500,000. No interest is payable on balances under £10,000, €10,000 or $10,000.Is this good?Sterling’s recent falls against the dollar and weakness against the euro mean now may not seem the ideal time to buy into foreign currencies. Even so, a 1 per cent overall cost for switching currencies is relatively low.Cater Allen says the account might suit those who travel abroad regularly. The ability to spend abroad or withdraw funds from overseas cashpoints at no charge or further conversion costs compares well with most credit and debit cards.What’s the catch?Unless users maintain a minimum balance of £5,000, $10,000 or €10,000, there’s a £10-a-month fee. And on these lower balances there’s no interest The account also has charges of £5 or more for accepting foreign cheque deposits, and fees start at £15 for foreign currency payments.What are the alternatives?Citibank offers foreign currency accounts, including its US Dollar Reward Saver account paying 3 per cent.Pre-paid currency cards from FairFX and CaxtonFX also allow holders to lock into euro or dollar exchange rates and spend the funds loaded on to the card later. These balances do not earn interest.A few credit and debit cards including those from Nationwide Building Society and the Abbey Zero are promoted to travellers. These have no foreign exchange loading on purchases, while Nationwide’s Flexaccount Visa Debit card does not charge for withdrawing currency from foreign cashpoints.How do I find out more?www.caterallen.co.uk or call 0800 092 3300.

The word on the street – or more accurately, the IOC’s sumptuous Chinese inner sanctum at the Beijing Hotel – is that competition for NBC, which is paying almost $900m (£482m) to broadcast the Beijing games, is hotting up. With US sports fans transfixed for days by swimmer Michael Phelps’s week-long quest for a record eight gold medals in the Beijing pool, it is a safe bet that the latest figures will do nothing to cool the networks’ competitive ardour.All told, some 191m US viewers – well over 60 per cent of the population – are said to have watched some part of the first nine days of the games. That is 14m more than tuned in at the same stage of the Athens Olympics in 2004 and 5m more than the Atlanta games in 1996, which was the most-viewed TV event in US history. The successful climax of Phelps’s quest on Saturday night, US time, attracted 40m US viewers, the best Saturday night rating for NBC for 18 years.No wonder the Baltimore Bullet is to be the big draw at a party in the centre of London coinciding with the formal handover ceremony for Olympic host cities past and present on Sunday. Perhaps, once the new US deal is agreed, the IOC might see fit to pay its biggest star a commission.It doesn’t ad upStill on Phelps, it is no surprise that the credit card people from Visa chose to exploit their relationship with the US swimmer with an advert – complete with voiceover from actor Morgan Freeman. What is surprising is that the homage was screened only in the US.It might have been different, apparently, had Visa’s flotation, which brought its regional companies under one roof, got away earlier. But, says Michael O’Hara Lynch, Visa head of global sponsorship marketing, “the reality was that various countries and regions around the world had already launched creative elements” – a reference to different Olympic ads in different regions based on other Olympians contracted to the company.An opportunity missed, no doubt – but at least the company has four years to ensure global distribution of another ad congratulating Phelps when, as already seems almost inevitable, he scoops yet another gold medal at the London games.On trackThe British Olympic Association has – rightly – won plaudits for its so-called FTSE initiative, which partners big British companies with the national governing bodies of Olympic sports to help improve their business performance. A total of 18 sports have been teamed up so far with blue chips such as Corus, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s.The all-conquering British track cycling team, who scooped another three medals yesterday, has not to date been paired off, however. They would be justified in thinking that most companies could pick up a tip or two from them about how to achieve sustained excellence.Action stationsAmong the business movers and shakers here in Beijing is Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One supremo, accompanied by his wonderful Croatian wife, Slavica. Quite what the irrepressible sports businessman is up to in the Chinese capital is a matter for conjecture, although it seems safe to assume F1 is not about to become an Olympic sport. What is not in doubt is that he is taking in plenty of action. Says a source: “Bernie goes everywhere where Croatia is playing.” I’d give short odds on the couple appearing at Wednesday’s Croatia v Spain men’s basketball quarter-final.Under the tableYou may, like me, have been under the impression that China was topping the medals table. So imagine my surprise when logging on to the nbcolympics.com website on Tuesday to find the US in pride of place. The US broadcaster’s classification is based, unlike just about everyone else’s, on aggregate medals won, hence ascribing the same value to medals of any colour, rather than the number of golds. You can’t help wondering whether the same approach would have been adopted had it not produced such a convenient result.Send your comments to davidowen58@netscape.net
495;V;Visa Inc;2008-08-13T18:43:37Z;A golden opportunity? How Chinese brands are betting on an Olympic boost;;When Li Ning, the celebrated Chinese gymnast turned sportswear entrepreneur, flew around Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium to light the Olympic torch last week, he instantly called the powerful nationalism of the opening ceremony into the service of his eponymous brand.Shares in the Hong Kong-listed company have since bucked a falling Hang Seng index to rise by almost 6 per cent. Doubtless millions in China now assume that Li Ning is an official Olympic sponsor. The irony is that it is not, although Chinese consumers regularly identify it as one of the domestic companies they associate most closely with the games.Chinese companies could spend several billion renminbi this year on Olympics-related marketing and advertising, on top of tens of millions spent on sponsoring everything from the Sudanese athletics team to yoghurt at the Olympic village. But many marketing and advertising experts in China wonder whether they are wasting their money.“For most Chinese companies, it’s not worthwhile to be a sponsor,” says Zhou Dongsheng, an expert on Chinese brands at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “The revenue, the profit, if you do the calculations, it just does not add up.”Beijing is using the Olympics to market itself as a superpower. It is also hoping that the advertising surrounding the games will help it achieve one of its top economic priorities for the next decade: to replace corporate China’s image as sweatshop to the world with a reputation for high-quality, high-valued-added and high-technology production.Marketing was a dirty word in China less than a generation ago, but even state-owned companies have snapped up Olympic sponsorships. “It’s like the government orders them to subsidise the games, maybe, because they are earning monopoly profits …so it’s time to pay back,” says Mr Zhou.But many are much less obviously coerced. Stanley Chen, head of Olympic projects for Heng Yuan Xiang, one of China’s largest textile companies, is certain that the games mark a golden opportunity for brand-building.“Coca-Cola were the sponsors for the Olympics in 1928 …without the Olympics, Coca-Cola would not be the current Coca-Cola brand,” he says. His company expects to lose money on this year’s games. He will not say how much, but he points out that a Beijing Olympics “partnership” – a more prestigious form of sponsorship than Heng Yuan Xiang has – costs at least $20m (€13m, £11m), with two to three times more than that spent on marketing and promotion.Lui Ruiqi, Heng Yuan Xiang’s founder, bristles when asked whether the money is worth it: he points out that his company is neither state-owned nor publicly owned, so “the money comes straight out of my pocket”.But marketing experts say many Chinese companies are not ready to exploit the games as a branding opportunity– and they point to Heng Yuan Xiang as a case in point. Earlier this year, the company was forced to withdraw a prominent television advertisement trumpeting its Olympics association after it was widely ridiculed in print and online.The 60-second advertisement, released to coincide with Chinese new year, featured a soundtrack that repeated the name of each Chinese zodiac animal three times, in the following pattern: “Rat, rat, rat, Heng Yuan Xiang, official sponsor of the Olympic Games! Ox, ox, ox, Heng Yuan Xiang, official sponsor of the Olympic Games!” and so on. Advertising analysts say the commercial displayed some of the most common – and worst – traits of Chinese advertising.“If you turn on any Chinese television station, most of the advertising is absolutely indistinguishable. It’s loud, it’s got the same voiceover, the production values are primitive to say the least – I mean, they are antediluvian,” says Tom Doctoroff, Greater China chief executive of JWT, the advertising agency.Mr Chen of Heng Yuan Xiang disagrees, arguing that repetition is crucial to brand recognition in China. He admits that the company’s advertisement was ridiculed but insists it helped make the connection between his company and the Olympics: “Before this advertisement, few people knew that Heng Yuan Xiang was a sponsor of the Beijing Olympic Games …but after this, most of the people, they remember the connection,” he says. “We think it’s very good to learn western advertising methods but we don’t think just simply bringing [them] into China will work for us.”Michael Wood, Greater China chief executive of Leo Burnett, the advertising agency, says some Olympics advertisements are better than others: “The advertising you’re seeing for the Olympics is a reflection of advertising in general in China: there’s a little bit of great, there’s a lot of mediocrity and there’s a reasonable amount that is right-out bad,” he says, noting that just because a company has the money to buy a sponsorship does not mean they have the marketing experience to exploit it.Mr Wood, whose agency advises Li Ning, says the founder’s Olympic flight brought cachet “that no money could have bought”. Zhang Zhiyong, the company’s chief executive, says the athlete was representing only himself at the games: “Mr Li and the management of the company have made a decision not to take advantage of the opening ceremony.” Consumers will make their own judgment.Few other Chinese companies can be singled out for having successfully managed their Olympics campaigns. “I think the global firms have been doing a better job in that regard, like Coke, like Visa. They’re not just saying that we are the sponsors. They make an emotional linkage between their brand and customer needs. For Chinese companies, I think they still have to learn,” says Mr Zhou of CEIBS. “The problem is, no one has really managed to get out ahead of the pack with the Olympics …there’s just this pack mentality with everyone doing very similar sort of stuff,” says Paul French of Access Asia, the retail consultancy in Shanghai.It does not help to have multiple sponsors, often in the same industry. There are no fewer than three beer sponsors, two in petrochemicals and two telecommunications sponsors. In total, more than 60 companies are official sponsors or partners of the games, while many more are trading off the Olympic spirit without paying for the sponsorship.Companies from Anta, the Chinese sportswear brand, to Air China to the Chinese Post Office are all vying to capture the spirit of patriotic triumphalism that dominates the world’s second largest advertising market. Advertisement after advertisement plays on broadly the same theme: Chinese athletes rising above the toiling masses to glory. Most touch the same pressure points, making it hard for consumers to differentiate one product from another.So-called “ambush marketing” by non-sponsors is also rife: “The Olympics is so wrapped up with China as a brand that it’s very easy to …identify yourself with the Olympics. You don’t need to have rings, or you can have a few rings,” says Mr French. “There is a big confusion about who really is a sponsor and who isn’t, not officially, but there is a confusion in consumers’ minds,” he says. According to a consumer survey done last month by R3, the Chinese marketing consultancy, of the top 10 companies most closely associated with the Olympics, two are not sponsors at all.Political risk has also tarnished the Olympics sponsorship campaign of Lenovo, the computer company – the only Chinese company to win a seat in the elite group of 12 global Olympics sponsors, alongside Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Johnson & Johnson. Lenovo designed the Olympic torch, which attracted protests in London and Paris, where demonstrators saw it as a symbol of Chinese repression in Tibet (see below).Most Chinese companies are focusing their Olympics efforts on the domestic market – they will be happy to gain more global recognition but the crucial market is still at home. “One of the good things about Chinese business thinking and strategy is that they have a very pragmatic view of what’s feasible and not feasible, and I think that they all do understand that in order to expand their brands internationally it takes more than just an Olympic push,” says Mr Doctoroff.So will the games mark a watershed for China’s brands? In terms of global recognition, they are likely to reap little – with the possible exception of Lenovo. Even at home, Chinese companies have a lot of hard work ahead to build their brands, most marketing experts agree.“Brands are not just a question of desire, it’s also a question of concrete corporate structure …it’s still very rare to see a truly marketing-driven organisation, as opposed to a sales-driven organisation,” says Mr Doctoroff. Many Chinese companies take a short-term view of profits – and do not want to invest money over the longer term to build their brand.Mr Zhou of CEIBS makes an even more basic point: that brands are about much more than marketing anyway. “In the end, it’s really the basic work, whether you have reliable quality, good service, that are the fundamental attributes of a brand. The Olympic Games just give you a platform that you can leverage, to promote your brand to a wider audience. But, in the end, it is really those details, everyday work, whether your workers pay attention to those details, that matters – not how many billions of people watch sports advertising on television.”Additional reporting by Geoff DyerCareful Lenovo attempts to build a connectionTensions were high as the Olympic torch made its way to San Francisco this spring for the only North American stop of its troubled world tour. Deepak Advani, head of marketing at Lenovo, the Chinese personal computer maker, was not taking any chances, writes Kevin Allison.Human rights protesters had disrupted the relay in London and Paris and briefly extinguished the Olympic flame, creating a public relations nightmare for Chinese authorities.Lenovo had already decided not to buy billboard advertising ahead of the relay. In consultation with local authorities, Lenovo’s marketing teams took extra precautions. They cancelled plans for marketers to distribute promotional materials to the crowds along the relay route out of concern for workers’ safety.The decision to pass up the opportunity for publicity around the torch relay was no doubt difficult for Lenovo, the only Chinese company among the top global sponsors of the games.In any other year, the torch relay would have been viewed as marketing gold – an opportunity to attach one’s brand to an event that has come to epitomise the Olympic spirit. But the politically charged atmosphere in the run-up to this year’s games meant that Lenovo had little choice but to lie low.“We make computers, we don’t get involved in politics,” Mr Advani says. “We had to look at the events in San Francisco, London and Paris, and ask if they tarnished the Olympic brand, and then say, through association, have they affected sponsors’ brands?”Few companies have more riding on the success of this year’s Olympics than Lenovo, whose sponsorship of the Beijing games is the centrepiece of a big and expensive three-year push to establish the company as a genuinely global brand – a transition it has struggled with since its $1.3bn (€874m, £696m) purchase of IBM’s personal computer group in 2005.Lenovo hopes to use the two-week competition as a showcase for its products. It has prepared an advertising campaign designed to emphasise the company’s design and engineering as it attempts to reach beyond its core market in China to reach companies and consumers around the world.In addition to being a top-tier sponsor, Lenovo is providing all the computers, printers, servers and other information technology equipment required to run the games. In return, it has the right to advertise using the Olympic logo.Lenovo was a sponsor and sole provider of IT equipment to the 2006 winter games in Turin. Although the company considered the event a success, it was only a prelude to this summer’s main event.The company is airing television advertisements in key markets such as the US and China throughout the two-week contest. Its advertising blitz also features a strong internet component.Several Olympic athletes are maintaining Lenovo-sponsored blogs during the competition. The company has also set up internet lounges in the Olympic village where athletes will be able to check e-mail and keep in touch with supporters back home. Other fans will be able to keep tabs on the games through an application on Facebook.Lenovo is also employing an army of people on the ground to assist in local “activation” efforts similar to the one it had planned for San Francisco. Branding experts say such local engagement is key to successful sponsorship of big-ticket events such as the Olympics. “It would be impossible for someone to go to Beijing and not realise Lenovo’s association with the games,” Mr Advani says.Lenovo needs to make the most of the opportunity. This year’s Olympics mark the end of three years of Olympic sponsorship for the company. Acer, a fast-growing Taiwanese rival, will take Lenovo’s place as official IT sponsor of the London summer games in 2012.David Melançon, a partner at the Ito Partnership, a brand consultancy, says he is impressed with Lenovo’s efforts to connect with potential customers through blogging and social networking during the games. But he remains sceptical of the company’s overall branding effort.Mr Melançon, who also worked with Visa, the credit card company, during its past Olympic sponsorships, says Lenovo suffers from the same problems faced by other Chinese brands. “They haven’t really come up with something that says ‘that’s a Lenovo machine, I’ve got to have it’, ” he says. “Chinese industry has proven to be adept at taking products in from other places and making them faster, better and cheaper. But they haven’t brought in that feeling behind the product.”It is that very perception that Lenovo’s big Olympic marketing push is designed to address. “We’re looking not just for people to know who we are, but to have a special emotional connection to Lenovo, and think of us the next time they buy a PC,” Mr Advani says. “The Olympics are still a fantastic platform for us to introduce ourselves to the world.”
496;V;Visa Inc;2008-08-10T15:54:30Z;Brands act local to woo 1bn Chinese;;"In preparing to host the Olympic Games, the Chinese have had to embrace western standards to meet the promises made to the International Olympic Committee. Many factories have now been shuttered, to reduce pollution and improve air quality in Beijing. Legions of Chinese soldiers have cleared infestations of algae from the coastal locations of yachting races. Beijing taxi drivers have been ordered not to spit, in deference to visiting tourists.The deadline of the Games gave government officials an action-forcing event to accelerate the modernisation of Chinese society. World-class architectural design and construction standards have guided the building of Olympic venues. Airports, highways and other infrastructure have been upgraded, not only in Beijing but in all the cities where Olympic events will be held. The Olympics have long been seen as China’s global coming-out party. Chinese pride and ambition demand that they be the best ever, no matter what the cost, and that Chinese athletes win more medals than those from any other country.Three months ago, China’s investment looked to be at risk. The litany of criticisms andpratfalls seemed endless: Chinese government policy toward Tibet and Darfur; human rights concerns, from restrictions on journalists to arbitrary land expropriations; lead paint in Mattel toys; and rampant corruption despite the occasional execution. The word “boycott” was in the air, and the Olympic torch was attacked repeatedly, from Paris to San Francisco, on its progress around the globe.All that is now a distant memory, as it should be. The IOC remained stalwart. The sponsors, from Coca-Cola (above) to Adidas, hung tough. And, once the torch arrived in China, there was no more nonsense. Because it is and should be all about the athletes. So what if the Chinese government wants to show off how far the country has come in 30 years? It is, to say the least, one of the greatest economic turnrounds in human history.But when the athletes have gone home, and the polluting power plants come back on line, what will remain beyond the memories and good impressions?The answer is: brands. The year 2008 will not merely be the year of the Olympics. It will be the year of brands. Not only “Brand China” is being promoted on the world stage, but the commercial brands that are Olympic sponsors are driving home their advantage in the domestic Chinese market.The Chinese are already in love with brands. How can you stand out in a nation of 1.3bn with high population mobility? Young Chinese are known by the brands they can afford and the brands they display. Via fashion accessories, mobile phones and now cars, brand choices are stratifying a hitherto communist society. The billions of daily purchases of trusted brand names are an increasing part of the social glue that holds Chinese society together.From Coca-Cola to McDonald’s, from Visa to Samsung, a record 63 companies have paid the IOC more money than ever for their category exclusive sponsorship rights. And given the size and growth of the Chinese economy, plus the undercurrent of concern about China in the west, these sponsors have allocated more of their global Olympics budgets than ever to marketing their brands in the host nation.The Chinese are being subjected to a deluge of advertising by western multinationals seeking to expand their geographic reach beyond the big cities to the outlying provinces. Olympics-related advertising by these companies could exceed $6bn. Most of this advertising is not directly promoting brand features and attributes. Rather, it aims to wrap the western brand in the cloak of Chinese nationalism.From Volkswagen’s “honk for China” campaign to Pepsi’s limited edition of red-coloured cans accompanying the slogan “Go red for China”, western brands are taking the “act local” mantra to a new extreme. Few of them are implementing a unified global campaign for this Olympics. Instead, they are typically running two campaigns – one for China and another for the rest of the world.The same applies to Chinese companies such as Lenovo and Haier, which are seeking to make the most of their Olympics sponsorship to enhance their global stature.Lenovo, which acquired IBM’s personal computer business three years ago, has invested about $100m as the first Chinese company to become a global sponsor of the Olympics. Through doing so, Lenovo expects to increase its brand reputation and market share in China as much as in the rest of the world.But where will this vast consumption of brands lead? Choice is good. Engaging with brands is fun. Media diversity, fuelled by advertising, is welcome. But one cannot help wondering whether too many Chinese are consumers first and citizens second. The passion for consumption, enjoying the material fruits of a growing economy, risks becoming the convenient narcotic that postpones rather than advances political freedom.The writer is senior associate dean at Harvard Business School and co-author of Greater Good: How Good Marketing Makes For Better Democracy"
497;V;Visa Inc;2008-08-06T14:46:35Z;IPOs at lowest level for four years;;The global market for initial public offerings is running at its slowest since 2004 with fewer than 500 deals raising under $76bn so far this year. This is less than half the total amount raised by twice as many deals for the same period in 2007 and shows that the recent market turmoil continues to make investors wary of new listings.To the end of July this year, 499 deals raised $75.9bn, compared with 1,055 deals that raised $167bn at the same stage last year, before the worst impact of the credit crunch that has thrown the capital markets into a spin since last August.In the US, just 42 deals raised just over $30bn to the end of July according to Dealogic, the data provider, although the IPO of Visa in March raised about two thirds of that.Not including the proceeds from Visa’s record breaking stock market debut, the largest ever in the US, the global total raised through IPOs so far this year is at a five year low. IPOs from companies based in Asia Pacific raised more money than European companies and both raised more than US based companies.But a survey of IPO attorneys, issued earlier this week by public relations company Gavin Anderson, found them more optimistic than in 2007 that the US will retain its share of global equity issuance. Globally converging accounting standards and the prospect of further relaxation of US regulations affecting foreign issuers were important factors in forming this view.Over 90 per cent of the respondents to the survey said they believed new equity issuance in the US will be “much stronger” to “slightly stronger” in 2009. The most frequently cited factors holding back the current IPO market include lack of liquidity, investor fear and low valuations.Colin Diamond, an attorney at White & Case, said: ”Overall, actual pricings and deals going to market have dropped dramatically since last year, but what we are still seeing is that filings are holding up much better than pricings, and people are still planning for deals in the second half of this year and next year.”One factor often cited by analysts as making the US IPO market more attractive to foreign issuers has been the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to allow foreign issuers to use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) rather than US GAAP reporting standards.Three of the top five equity underwriters so far this year are banks that have suffered severely as a result of the credit crunch. Citigroup is ranked the top global underwriter so far this year by Dealogic, with a 10 per cent market share, just ahead of UBS in second and Merrill Lynch in fourth place.

The industrials sector as a whole dropped 2.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment benefit last week jumped by the most in five years. That bodes ill for the key payrolls report due on Friday.A $2 drop in the oil price helped contain losses for much of the session but stocks slid to their lowest levels of the day at the close.Nine of the ten leading industry groups lost ground, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.3 per cent to 1,267.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 11,378.02, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2 per cent to 2,325.39.Over a volatile month, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, paring early losses as government measures to backstop the mortgage groups, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped to restore confidence to the financial sector.“After coming in like a Lion, July went out like a lamb,” said Alec Young, equity strategist at S&P, pointing to rock-bottom sentiment, a drop in oil prices and second-quarter earnings that were not as bad as expected as additional reasons for the market recovery.The financials were the biggest monthly gainers, adding 6.8 per cent after a roller-coaster ride that saw them down as much as 15 per cent and up as much as 10 per cent.Consumer staples, healthcare and industrials also made solid gains of 3.3 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, as investors moved into defensive sectors and dropped from early-year winners. Energy stocks, for example, dropped 14 per cent.Nonetheless, Mr Young is cautious. “While these positives have helped the market find a short-term floor at 1,200 on the S&P 500, we think its ability to . . . build upward momentum will be driven by the second-half macro-economic outlook and its implications for corporate profit,” he said. “With so many wildcards still in play, we expect equity markets to remain choppy.”The macro-economic data overshadowed another handful of mixed earnings reports.In the technology sector, Symantec and Motorola made ground after posting a better-than-anticipated forecast and a surprise profit, respectively.Symantec added 7 per cent to $21.07 while Motorola jumped 12.5 per cent to $8.64.That news helped offset decent results from Visa and Mastercard, which nevertheless left investors underwhelmed. Visa shares, which have jumped about 65 per cent since the company went public in March, fell 6.9 per cent to $73.06. Mastercard shares slid 9.8 per cent to $244.15.In the consumer discretionary sector, Starbucks posted its first loss in 16 years though the shares advanced 0.1 per cent to $14.69 after it reaffirmed its 2009 full-year forecasts.Energy was the worst performer, dropping 3.4 per cent after some disappointing results from ExxonMobil and Consol Energy. Exxon fell 4.7 per cent to $80.43 while Consol Energy slid 15.9 per cent to $74.39.Financials were another weak spot, falling 1.3 per cent. Wells Fargo lost 3 per cent to $30.27, JPMorgan slipped 2.3 per cent to $40.63 and Bank of America dipped 2.1 per cent to $32.90.Healthcare was the only sector to make consistent progress throughout the day, climbing 0.3 per cent.Aetna, the health insurer, led the way after it said profit had risen 6.5 per cent to $480.5m as the company added members. Aetna stood by its full-year profit forecast and the shares rose 1.7 per cent to $41.01.ImClone Systems surged 37.7 per cent to $63.93 after Bristol-Myers Squibb offered to buy the part of the company that it does not yet own for $4.3bn. Bristol slipped 1.8 per cent to $21.12.
499;V;Visa Inc;2008-07-31T18:19:37Z;MasterCard and Visa avoid slowdown;;MasterCard and Visa, the world’s two largest credit card networks, are so far resisting the effects of the US economic slowdown by focusing on overseas business and a growing preference for credit and debit cards over cash and cheques.Visa this week reported a 41 per cent rise in fiscal third-quarter profit to $422m as payment volumes, transactions and the number of cards in Visa’s network grew in every region the card issuer is active in.MasterCard on Thursday reported a $276m profit – excluding a charge related to a litigation settlement – as a result of a 25 per cent increase in second-quarter revenues based on similar factors.Visa and MasterCard are sidestepping the rising customer defaults at other card companies such as American Express and Capital One because they collect fees to process payments between financial institutions but do not take the risk of making loans to consumers.They are exposed to the potential for lower overall spending volumes as consumers tighten their belts but, even as the US economy slows, the growing adoption of card-based payments in the US and overseas has helped contribute to growth for the two companies.Joe Saunders, chief executive of Visa, said that, while the challenging US economic environment had contributed to a softening in traditional credit card spending, US consumers were continuing to spend on their debit cards, for example.Robert Selander, president and chief executive officer of MasterCard, said: “Businesses, consumers and governments around the world are demonstrating a growing preference for electronic payments, and our cross-border volumes remain healthy as cardholders come to rely on electronic payments and the ease, security and convenience they provide.”Meanwhile, more than 50 per cent of MasterCard revenue is generated outside of the US, which has also helped to counteract the impact of the US economic downturn.Visa is more reliant on the US market but still generates around a third of its revenue from overseas transactions.Shares in both MasterCard and Visa fell on Thursday, however, as MasterCard’s second-quarter profit was transformed into a $747m loss by a $1bn litigation charge. MasterCard was off 8 per cent by midday in New York while Visa lost 4.19 per cent.MasterCard reached a $1.8bn settlement with American Express in June over a lawsuit that claimed MasterCard, Visa and some of their member banks had blocked financial companies from issuing credit cards through American Express.The settlement followed an earlier agreement with Visa for $2.25bn, making the combined antitrust settlement the largest in the US. Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted any liability as part of the settlements.

It wouldn’t surprise me if I found a pair of Blahniks or Louboutins!” says PJ Gach, a music reviewer and self-confessed fashion addict, referring to her finds at Freemeets, a new way of swapping unwanted but still fashionable clothes.Almost perfectly tailored for the current belt-tightening economic climate and the drive towards greener lifestyles, Freemeets, which started in 2005, is effectively an opportunity to benefit – for free – from another person’s cast-offs. It was founded by Christina Salvi, director of the New York City branch of Freecycle.org, an online messageboard where people can post, item by item, things that they no longer want.Word on Freemeets spreads via social networking sites. In New York alone, its original community now has some 30,000 members.The rules are simple: a person walks in, takes what they want and leaves. Unlike clothes-swapping parties, visitors don’t have to bring clothes with them to participate. There is no entry fee, anyone can attend and donors can bring anything they want to give away. All items are inspected and sorted by volunteer organisers.“To begin with, there were a few chancers who would grab everything and try to sell it on the street,” says Gach. “Now it’s different. Because kids go through clothes so fast, we see families come of all incomes. Even fashionable teens get excited about used clothes.”And when it comes to luring a discerning clientele, Freemeets has one clear advantage over eBay. “For most people, especially those who love fashion, space is at a premium. If you take a chance on eBay and it doesn’t sell, well, it’s still going to clutter your closet.”Indeed, it may be fashion, in particular designer fashion, that makes Freemeets so appealing. “Within minutes of arriving at an event, I found a pair of men’s grey wool trousers that fitted and didn’t require tailoring, which as most men know is practically unheard of,” says Vincent Lai, a computer consultant.At a Freemeets event last summer, a young professional brought in a shopping bag filled with expensive suits and trousers. Before they could be sorted out, a fledgling City banker had approached the donor. Lucky for him, both men were the same size and he found himself with a “new” wardrobe.“Then there’s the woman who came in to donate a large bag of men’s wear,” says Gach. “Every item was new, with price tags. After falling out with her boyfriend, she decided he wasn’t getting his gifts!”As Freemeets become more popular, like-minded groups are collaborating with the organisation – such as Swap-O-Rama-Rama, a group that does on-the-spot silk screening and also brings sewing stations to the events to transform clothing.The online retail world has also taken notice. The website Commuto.com combines swapping with social networking, allowing users to create profiles with lists of items they want to find – and those they want to get rid of.With more Freemeets planned for the back-to-school rush in September and for the festive season, it appears that some of the good things in life really are free.www.recyclethisnyc.org

Last year, Visa got in on the action by setting up a small pop-up shop in London’s Knightsbridge on the premise that donors would bring in unwanted items (anything from Primark to Prada), receive points, and go “shopping” with them for other items donated by like-minded label-lovers.Among the display tables there were some rich pickings to be found, including dresses by Giles Deacon and cast-off Miu Miu bags from Lindsay Lohan. Any leftovers were sent to the charity TRAID (Textile Recycling for Aid and International Development). The event was such a success that this weekend Visa has taken over three storeys in a Covent Garden loft, offering not only women’s wear, but men’s wear and accessories too.”As fashion and shopping go hand-in-hand, we realised that this presented an excellent way to engage with a key group of consumers,” says Simon Kleine, head of corporate communications for Visa Europe. “At the same time, fashion provides a route to demonstrate responsible spending using the ‘swap’ idea.”For some time now, swap meets have been more than informal living room parties. Emily Chester launched www.swapstyle.com in July 2004. After paying an initial fee, members can connect with people by posting items across the world.Offline, meanwhile, Swap-O-Rama-Rama is perhaps the largest and most well-known swap company. Founded in October 2005 by the singer-songwriter Wendy Tremayne, the collective now organises (or publicises) swap meets from Vancouver to Istanbul. And California-based SwapSF – launched in 2006 as a party event attracting over 600 people – along with Clothing Swap (also based in San Francisco), organise swap meets for groups of girlfriends or companies. Swapping fashion has now become such an organised affair that the trend even has its own Wikipedia page (type in “clothing swap”), promoting the events as “easy and cheap to organise” and a “good way to both declutter and refill one’s wardrobe”.www.swapstyle.com

501;V;Visa Inc;2008-07-16T00:40:34Z;Emerging market groups take lead in IPOs;;Emerging market companies are raising the lion’s share of cash on the world’s equity markets as they seek money for expansion in spite of the deteriorating financial and economic conditions.These companies accounted for 70 per cent of the value of global initial public offerings since April 1 compared with 45 per cent over the same period last year before the credit crunch hit issuance from western-based operations, according to Dealogic, the data provider.The volumes of companies from the developing nations are still much lower than they were before last summer’s crisis.The number of emerging market IPO issuance fell 45 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. However, this compares with a fall of 65 per cent in IPO issuance of companies based in the developed world.Michael Lavelle, co-head of capital markets at Citigroup, said: “IPOs will continue for companies in growth sectors and markets. In many emerging markets, the economies are still expanding rapidly, as are the earnings for the companies based there. This is why the majority of IPOs this year are coming from the emerging markets.”OGX, the Brazilian oil and gas company, priced the biggest emerging market IPO this year, raising $4.1bn last month. Latin America continues to grow strongly on the back of soaring commodity prices as countries rich in resources remain relatively sheltered from the financial shocks.Matthew Koder, joint head of global capital markets at UBS, said: “The themes that dominate are clearly resource related.”Other notable IPOs from Latin America included a $1.7bn deal from Fresnilo, the world’s largest silver producer, which became the first Mexican company to launch such a deal on the London Stock Exchange in May.Asia saw some big IPOs as this part of the world continues to grow strongly, too, in spite of big falls in many stock markets there. Big deals included a $2.6bn deal from Reliance Power, the Indian power company, in January, and a $2.5bn deal from China Railway Construction in May.Among the other big deals, New World Resources, which owns four Czech coal and mining companies, priced a $2.5bn IPO in May.Bankers say the pipeline for emerging market IPOs is strong, with a large number of deals expected over the next two months.In the first quarter, the biggest IPO of the year from Visa, the US credit and debit card company, distorted the numbers with emerging market companies making up only 28 per cent of the deals. However, with the $19.6bn Visa IPO stripped out of the data, emerging market companies made up 60 per cent of issuance in line with the trend of a larger deal volume out of the developing world.
502;V;Visa Inc;2008-06-25T20:52:17Z;MasterCard settles American Express lawsuit;;American Express has reached a $1.8bn settlement with MasterCard over a lawsuit that claimed MasterCard, Visa and some of their member banks had blocked financial companies from issuing credit cards through American Express.The settlement follows an earlier agreement with Visa for $2.25bn, making the combined antitrust settlement the largest ever in the US. It is likely to put pressure on both Visa and MasterCard to strike a deal with Discover Financial, which is seeking billions of dollars in damages for similar claims.Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted to liability as part of the settlements.American Express’s suit against the two payment processors and eight of their member banks was launched in 2004. It came after the US Supreme Court let stand a ruling that forced Visa and MasterCard to allow member banks to issue credit cards on rival networks.Ken Chenault, American Express chairman and chief executive, said the proceeds from the MasterCard settlement, which will amount to quarterly payments of $150m over the next three years, would help curb the effects of a slowing economy.“Business conditions continue to weaken in the US,” he said, adding that “the antitrust settlement …provides us with a multi-year source of funds that should, among other things, help to lessen the impact of this weakening economic cycle”.American Express shares closed 2.8 per cent lower at $40.94 in New York.Together with the payments from Visa, American Express expects to receive $880m a year for three years. However, the size of the payments is contingent upon the performance of American Express’s US global network services business. MasterCard said it would take a $1bn charge in the second quarter related to the settlement.Robert Selander, MasterCard chief executive, said: “Eliminating the uncertainty, time commitment, and expense of a prolonged court case is in the best interest of our shareholders, our customers and our management team.”MasterCard, which went public two years ago, had been under pressure to resolve the suit because uncertainty surrounding the litigation was one of the few clouds looming over its stock. Shares in MasterCard rose by 3.4 per cent to $291.51 close at $289.79 on Wednesday.Visa settled with American Express in November 2007 and made an initial payment of $945m. It used proceeds from its initial public offering to make an additional payment in March and will pay $70m each quarter until the full settlement is reached.
503;V;Visa Inc;2008-06-19T22:45:01Z;Citi warns of further large writedowns;;Citigroup on Thursday warned of further large writedowns and credit losses in the second quarter, saying its business remained under pressure amid “unprecedented” market conditions.The announcement, made by Gary Crittenden, Citi’s chief financial officer, sent Citi shares more than 4 per cent lower in New York afternoon trading, although they recovered to close down 1 per cent.Citi’s warning, which comes after disappointing second-quarter results from Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, is likely to compound investors’ fears that the credit crunch will weigh on US financial companies for months to come.In a call with investors, Mr Crittenden said the company expected to report writedowns on its exposure to subprime mortgages, leveraged loans and monoline insurance when it unveiled quarterly results next month.Mr Crittenden said the writedowns were likely to be “substantial” but lower than last quarter, when Citi suffered pre-tax writedowns of $10.5bn on those securities.He added that Citi’s mortgage and credit card businesses had deteriorated in the past three months as the US economic slowdown and housing crisis continued to take their toll on consumers.As a result, credit costs and provisions in the second three months of the year were likely to be higher than the $5.5bn recorded in the first quarter, he said.“Consumer credit remains a challenge, especially in the US,” Mr Crittenden said.Citi’s results would also be hit by a $325m charge on the sale of CitiCapital, a leasing company, and by the lack of the $1.1bn one-off gain from the sale of its shares in Visa that was booked in the first quarter. Mr Crittenden said expenses were likely to remain flat in the quarter as Citi’s cost-cutting efforts were offset by redundancy payments.The CFO’s downbeat comments underline the challenges faced by Vikram Pandit, Citi’s chief executive, in growing the company’s earnings and cutting expenses in the midst of the financial crisis. Citi’s shares have lost more than 60 per cent of their value over the past year. They closed at $20.17 on Thursday.Last month, Mr Pandit, who replaced Chuck Prince in December, announced an ambitious plan to boost profits and cut costs by shedding up to $500bn in unwanted assets from Citi’s $2,000bn-plus balance sheet.Separately, Citi announced the acquisition of the Brazilian retail brokerage Intra for an undisclosed sum. Intra is Brazil’s third largest independent brokerage with 50,000 client accounts and about 13bn reals in stocks under custody. Citi said Intra had 15,000 active clients and 1.2bn reals ($747m) in assets.
504;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;China fund shuns guns and gambling;;China’s $200bn sovereign wealth fund intends to be a socially responsible global investor by shunning industries such as gambling, tobacco and arms manufacturing, the fund’s president said on Friday.“We are looking at clean energy and environmentally-friendly investment,” Gao Xiqing, president of China Investment Corp, said at a conference in Beijing. CIC would look at “everything cross-border except for casinos, tobacco companies or machine-gun companies”. As far as is publicly known, the fund has primarily invested in financial services.Recently, Mr Gao has insisted that CIC’s investments are not politically motivated and that the fund is committed to improving transparency.At times he has also expressed frustration over the political opposition his fund faces in some countries. “Why don’t people let economics decide, rather than focus on the political bullshit?“Fortunately, there are more than 200 countries in the world. And, fortunately, there are many countries who are happy with us,” he said.While the UK has welcomed CIC, politicians in other countries, including the US and Germany, have voiced concern over how much influence China’s communist rulers exert over CIC’s investments and whether those investments are driven by political or strategic motivations.CIC officials have publicly acknowledged a certain amount of pressure to make investments deemed to be in the national interest but they say the fund is not beholden to political interest groups and makes investments purely on commercial grounds.CIC made its first investment in May last year, paying $3bn for a pre-flotation stake in US private equity firm Blackstone.In December, it paid $5bn for close to 10 per cent of Morgan Stanley and more recently signed an agreement to co-invest billions in a private equity fund set up by JC Flowers that will focus on financial institutions. It has also invested in the listings of Visa and China Railway Group.CIC’s chairman Lou Jiwei estimates the fund must earn about Rmb300m ($43m) each business day to service its debt. Of its $200bn in assets, the fund has $80bn-$90bn to invest overseas. The rest is being used to recapitalise state-owned banks and absorb Central Huijin, which manages state holdings in Chinese financial institutions.

The nations identified by the review are Brazil, South Africa, Malaysia, Botswana, Bolivia, Venezuela, Trinidad & Tobago, Mauritius, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland.Home Office ministers had planned to announce curbs quickly but in a concession to the Foreign Office, individual countries will be approached through diplomatic channels and offered a grace period.Visa requirements, a key measure of diplomatic relations, could prompt tit-for-tat responses against UK interests if tightened.Brazil is described by the Foreign Office website as a “rapid emerging global player of great importance to British interests – economic, political and commercial”.Relations with Malaysia are described as “strong and deep – especially in areas of trade, investment, science and education”. There are 11,500 Malaysian students in UK universities.Richard Caborn, Gordon Brown’s ‘sports czar’, said South Africa and Trinidad & Tobago were supporting England’s World Cup bid.“We have to ensure there is good justification for doing this. This could be highly detrimental …I hope the government will not rush into it,” he said.Liam Byrne, the immigration minister, said this year the visa regime should widen. The Home Office said: “Our assessment for which countries need visas is still ongoing.”
506;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
507;V;Visa Inc;2008-06-05T18:22:54Z;Chinese IPOs;;"Back to the future. China, source of some of the world’s biggest initial public offerings in recent years, is preparing to unleash another blockbuster. China Construction Engineering Corp’s planned IPO is expected to raise about $6bn. This would be China’s fourth largest IPO and the biggest in the world so far this year behind Visa of the US.Market dynamics, however, could not be more different from last year, when IPOs raised $63bn, according to Dealogic. That year, the Shanghai composite index of renminbi- denominated “A” shares almost doubled. Selling stock was like handing candy to children: oversubscription levels were massive and investors were rewarded with an average 150 per cent gain on the first day of trading. This year, by contrast, the index is down about 40 per cent and daily turnover has slumped.Chinese authorities, exploiting the power granted to regulators in what is still – when required – a command economy, have sought to prop up prices. Brakes put in place as the market roared ahead last year, including the introduction of a share trading tax, were swiftly dismantled on the way down. In April, authorities moved to curb sales of state-owned shares, partially unwinding reforms of state-owned shares in 2005.Meanwhile, authorities are aiming to pique interest by introducing activities such as margin lending. The orchestrated balance between supply and demand, however, is imperfect. When the market was resurgent, the fledgling fund management industry found it easy to attract investors: Z-Ben, a fund management consultancy, says fund managers were able to pull in $1.5bn in a day; now it takes a month to raise just a fraction of that. Yet some 50 new funds have been approved so far this year, more than were approved in the whole of last year. The vast majority of these are equity-focused. Regulators have more tweaking to do before Shanghai regains its allure.Post and read comments on this Lex"

So far this year, 37 US-listed IPOs worth a combined $28.7bn have come to market. Of that total, $19.65bn was raised by Visa in the largest US IPO.This conservative approach to market debuts is not limited to the US.Globally, 130 deals worth $23.7bn have been shelved or cancelled so far this year, up from 38 deals worth about $6.9bn cancelled during the same period last year.The market for Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (Spac) – companies that begin life as shells, raise money through IPOs and set out to acquire operating businesses within a certain deadline, usually two years – has also not been immune from the problems affecting the wider IPO market.While the market for US IPOs falters, the London Stock Exchange has seen a surge in IPOs in the last two months, helped by increasing activity from emerging market companies.Companies have raised more than $5bn in IPOs since April 16 – nearly 10 times more than the amount listed between January 1 and April 15.

In spite of inflation and the credit crisis, first-quarter gross domestic product came in at a revised 0.9 per cent, suggesting the US economy may yet skirt a full-blown recession.A rally in financials kicked markets into decidedly positive territory after a report from JPMorgan predicted the sector was due for a bounce based on tightening spreads on bank credit default swaps.Still, a rise in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week, after an unexpected fall in the prior week, held gains in check.The benchmark S&P 500 trimmed gains at the close but remained 0.5 per cent higher at 1,398.23 for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.4 per cent at 12,646.22. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 2,508.32.In the past few days, equities have recovered about half the ground they lost last week as softening energy prices have offered some respite to US consumers.Rising prices are having a mixed impact on corporations and households. On Thursday, Sears Holdings, the department store chain, reported an unexpected first-quarter net loss, knocking its share price 3.6 per cent to $86.14.Analysts said that the store’s middle-of-the-range goods were particularly susceptible to the current economic slowdown as consumers were trading down to cheaper brands in order to save money. Conversely, Big Lots, which sells excess inventory, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and raised its full-year earnings forecast.HJ Heinz was another consumer-facing company to report positive results and forecasts. The food group said fourth-quarter profit rose thanks to gains from currency effects and higher prices and raised its predictions for full-year earnings.Big Lots shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $30.66, Heinz climbed 3.6 per cent to $49.25, while the consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent.Whether corporations will be able to maintain that earnings growth going forward remains a moot point.Alongside the other data released on Thursday, the Department of Commerce noted that corporate profit growth during the first quarter rose 3.8 per cent after falling 3.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year.The headline numbers may go some way to easing fears that corporate profits will be swamped by rising costs and falling demand. But the details were less salutary as domestic profits and profits from financial firms both declined.Many are sceptical about the broader earnings outlook. Strategists at UBS said: “Estimates for this year may still be a bit high given our forecast for slowing growth and peaking margins . . . Moreover, estimates for 2009 appear far too rosy, driven by a forecast record expansion of profit margins.”Some of the weakest performers earlier in the week were amongst the strongest gainers on Thursday. Healthcare advanced 1.5 per cent in part due to a Goldman Sachs recommendation that investors should by call options in the sector.Merck was a notable gainer, adding 0.7 per cent to $38.92 after a series of court decisions overturned claims against the pharmaceutical giant resulting from its withdrawn painkiller, Vioxx.Consumer staples and financials added 1.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively.In financials, Bank of America, which rose 2.2 per cent to $34.60 and Citigroup, which added 2 per cent to $22.04, led the way.MasterCard was another stand-out, rising 7.7 per cent to $309, after it raised its targets for profit growth. Rivals Visa and American Express advanced 4.1 per cent to $85.25 and 1.3 per cent to $46.75 respectively.But material and energy stocks followed commodity prices lower, losing 0.9 per cent each. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and ConocoPhillips dropped 5.4 per cent to $113.18 and 1.7 per cent to $90.96.
510;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Beating bank charges when abroad;;Frequent travellers to the Eurozone may find it makes sense to take out a UK bank account in euros.From an exchange-rate perspective alone, given how much the euro has strengthened against the pound over the past year, now may not seem like the best time to do this.HiFX calculates that if a person had opened a euro account in July 2007 and converted £1,000 into euros, they would have received €1,497.Now, however, the rate change would mean they would receive just €1,253. If the euro strengthens further it would make sense to open a euro account now, but opinion is divided on whether it does have further to go.But the purpose of having a euro bank account is not just to lock into an exchange rate. The main reason is that euro accounts can drastically cut fees when abroad.Moneyfacts warned this week that some credit cards charge as much as 3 per cent for purchases and card transactions when abroad. Debit card charges can be even higher with many foreign ATMs still charging to take out money.Add to this the cash transaction charge and conversion charges and you could be looking at up to £5 per £100 withdrawn.With a euro bank account, many of these fees will not apply.Cater Allen offers a Visa card that incurs no conversion or transaction charges at foreign ATMs – it warns, though, that ATM handling charges may still apply. Coutts offers a charge card with a €30 annual fee, which incurs no further transaction charges when used abroad, though it still attracts fees when used in ATMs.Which account to choose will very much depend on the purpose of the account.Joanna O’Brien, senior savings researcher at Moneyfacts, says: “You need to think about what you’ll use the account for – is it to transfer money abroad or is it to take cash out? You need to look at the fees you’ll be charged for making all these transactions.”Citibank UK, for example, offers fee-free transfers between UK and foreign euro-denominated accounts. Those from its sterling accounts are charged up to 2 per cent in conversion charges.It could also make sense to have a euro account if you receive income from abroad. Nick Gill at Coutts says: “A lot of people use these currency accounts where they’re in receipt of foreign income, say if you were receiving rent from a property rented abroad.”If you are likely to hold a limited amount of euros in a euro currency account and transfer funds across from sterling as needed, you should make sure that there is no charge for transfers between accounts.Cater Allen, for example, allows free switching. However, it also requires a minimum deposit of €10,000 which may be too hefty for some.
511;V;Visa Inc;2008-04-29T21:04:48Z;Wall St lower ahead of Fed decision;;Wall Street stocks hung in the doldrums on Tuesday as investors digested data showing that two pillars of the US economy – house prices and consumer confidence – continue to crumble, and a sell-off in commodities hit related stocks.The day began in downbeat fashion as markets reacted poorly to the S&P/Case Shiller 20-city house price index, which plunged for a 10th consecutive month and at an accelerating rate. The three-month annualised rate of decline in US house prices is now nearly 25 per cent.That prospect continues to damp consumer confidence. The latest survey showed consumer confidence hit the lowest level since just before the US-led invasion of Iraq.Julian Jessop at Capital Economics, said: “The financial markets may have decided that the glass is half full but consumers remain stubbornly miserable . . . All things considered, the downbeat views of consumers appear much closer to reality.”The biggest drag, however, was the materials sector which dipped 3.1 per cent, its biggest fall in over a month, following commodities prices lower.A mini-rally in technology, which climbed for the first time in three sessions, and some steady performances from consumer discretionary stocks helped markets retain a measure of composure.After a light session of trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,390.96, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,831.94. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,426.10.Investors remain listless ahead of a likely 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a host of potentially market-moving economic data to be released later in the week.With volumes on the low side, equity markets have treaded water for much of the week so far, piqued only by news that Mars, the confectioner, could purchase chewing-gum heavyweight Wrigley for $23bn, aided by Warren Buffett.Healthcare stocks lagged as poor earnings, analyst downgrades and news of drug approval setbacks hit the sector. Merck led the fallers, dropping 10.4 per cent to $37.14 after its cholesterol pill failed to win approval. It was followed by Medco Health, down 4.3 per cent to $49.12, and Tenet Healthcare, down 2.2 per cent to $6.55.Financials were in focus after Countrywide, the mortgage lender that Bank of America has agreed to buy, reported its third quarterly loss in a row. Analysts said the results may lead Bank of America to reduce or even cancel its offer to buy the company for $4bn in stock.Countrywide shares rose 0.3 per cent to $5.85, while Bank of America lost 0.8 per cent to $37.86 and the wider sector was mixed. The S&P 500 index of financial shares ended the day down 0.6 per cent.According to KBW, of the 119 banks it covers, just over half have missed consensus earnings estimates, because of rapidly deteriorating assets. More worryingly, the growth of non-performing assets has outpaced that of reserves suggesting more problems lie ahead.Despite the negative data, homebuilder stocks, which have been unpredictable in the face of the ever-deepening housing slump, were mixed on Tuesday. DR Horton dropped 2.7 per cent to $16.69 and Pulte Homes slid 2.8 per cent to $13.80 but Lennar and Centex added 3.8 per cent to $20.28 and 4 per cent to $22.27 respectively.In materials, the mood was broadly pessimistic. Titanium Metals lost 6.1 per cent to $15.95, Monsanto fell 9.1 per cent to $110.93 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 4.4 per cent to $110.72.But there were bright spots. Office Depot said first-quarter profits fell less than expected and its shares advanced 8.7 per cent to $13.Credit card companies outperformed. Visa said profit jumped 28 per cent thanks in part to strong international growth. Visa shares, which have risen more than 70 per cent since its $17.9bn initial public offering last month, added 6.9 per cent to $80.85.Meanwhile, MasterCard, Visa’s main rival, popped 12.7 per cent to $273.34 after it said first-quarter profit soared 85 per cent to $398m thanks to strong revenues, beating estimates.Technology was among the strongest sectors in the S&P 500 on the day. Corning added 3.3 per cent to $26.53 after it said first-quarter profit more than tripled, and Yahoo and Motorola climbed 3.6 per cent to $27.37 and 5.7 per cent to $10 respectively.
512;V;Visa Inc;2008-04-23T22:32:52Z;American Water debut disappoints;;"American Water Works, the largest US private sector water utility, fell as much as 6 per cent in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday after German energy group RWE was forced to cut both the price and amount of shares it offered in its US subsidiary.The company’s float came against the backdrop of a subdued market for US
public offerings with the amount of equity issuance running well below last year’s levels. So far this year, just 27 companies have come to market in the US, raising a combined $27.4bn.Discounting the $19.7bn raised through the IPO of credit card company Visa last month, however, just $7.7bn has been raised through US-listed IPOs, almost half the amount raised through 77 deals by the same time last year.The partial flotation of American Water will bring in $1.2bn but that is $400m less than RWE was targeting last week and led the German electricity and gas group to issue a profit warning.Shares in American Water were down 2.8 per cent, to $20.89, shortly before midday in New York, having been as low as $20.22 earlier in the trading session.The IPO of American Water has turned into a troubled saga for RWE and its new chief executive, Jürgen Grossmann.Originally announced in November 2005, the IPO was first held up by an excruciating regulatory approval process in the US. Then, Mr Grossmann in his first big act as chief executive postponed the flotation last November, citing difficult market conditions in a move that unsettled investors.RWE, Germany’s second-largest energy group, sold 36 per cent of American Water rather than the 40 per cent it hoped for at a price of $21.50 rather than the $24-$26 price range it aimed for last week. It said it hoped to sell the rest of American Water later this year, if market conditions allowed.RWE will take a €600m ($954m) charge to go on top of a €429m one last year over American Water and this will mean net profit is likely to fall this year rather than rise 10 per cent, as the German group had previously forecast.Despite raising less than expected, American Water is the second-largest US IPO of the year to date, behind that of Visa. Several other companies, including alternative investment houses such as AQR, have elected to postpone stock market floats amid worries about the US credit crisis and the health of the US economy."
513;V;Visa Inc;2008-04-16T03:24:11Z;European banks to decide on Visa rival;;Leading French and German banks hope to decide within months on whether to set up a European debit card payment network that would be a rival to schemes operated by MasterCard and Visa.The banks – which include Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and BNP Paribas – are in talks with the European Commission over the plan but want more regulatory clarity before they decide to go ahead.Interest in a home-grown payment scheme comes as MasterCard and Visa have come under scrutiny by Brussels for the level of interchange fees charged when processing card payments. It also follows stock exchange listings by Visa and MasterCard that banks fear will reduce their negotiating power with the US companies.However, a person familiar with the plan – dubbed “Monnet” – said the Commission would need to accept an appropriate level of interchange fees before the banks would invest in a pan-European system. Banks might prefer to continue to use Visa and MasterCard without “a clear solution” from the Commission, the person said.The EU and institutions such as the European Central Bank have been keen to encourage new consortia to process debit and credit card transactions, believing customers could benefit from lower costs. This year a single European payments area has been introduced in 31 countries and by next year it is intended that direct debit transactions should cost the same across Sepa.Banks in Germany and France would give any scheme a critical mass, according to those familiar with the plans, since the two countries account for almost one-third of debit payments within Sepa.Officials in the Commission’s competition department confirmed there had been contacts with the Franco-German consortium, along with several other parties. They stressed that no decisions on the merits of any scheme had been made.A spokesman for Charlie McCreevy, the internal market commissioner, said that it was essentially for market participants to decide what action they wanted to take but that it had always been envisaged that Sepa would encourage new players into cross-border payments.
514;V;Visa Inc;2008-04-15T20:47:44Z;US stocks edge up in volatile session;;"Wall Street stocks climbed on Tuesday for the first time in three days as advances by financial and energy companies offset declines in healthcare stocks in a temperamental session of trading.The S&P 500 financials index swung between gains and losses but by mid-
afternoon bank and brokerage stocks had recovered thanks to a rare spot of good news from a pair of regional banks.Regions Financial, the biggest bank in Alabama, and M&T Bank, part-owned by Berkshire Hathaway, said gains from selling their stakes in Visa and increased fee income had enhanced first-quarter results.Regions shares rose 8.4 per cent to $20.12 while M&T added 6.3 per cent to $85.86, pushing broader indices into the black.That news helped offset revelations that State Street, the money manager for institutions, could be forced to bail out a number of mortgage-backed debt funds, or “conduits”, that have already incurred $1.49bn in unrealised mark-to-market losses. State Street fell 9.9 per cent to $69.23 after rising as much as 4 per cent earlier in the day after the company had reported a 69 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings.“If you are looking to see if we have turned a corner with financials, then the answer is probably no,” said Thomas Nyheim vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust. “They are going to keep coming out with mixed numbers, but it seems to be priced into the market.”The financials sector was among the leading gainers in the broader S&P 500, with the financials index up 1.1 per cent, snapping a five-day losing streak.Throughout the day the markets struggled to find a clear direction as investors were hit with a raft of conflicting data including reports showing rising inflation, stabilising manufacturing activity in New York state and a slightly more optimistic outlook among homebuilders.By the close, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,334.44.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,286.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also added 0.5 per cent, to 12,362.47.Still, the S&P 500 has fallen in four out of the past six sessions, as a string of disappointing first-quarter earnings results from the likes of Wachovia, and expectations of worse to come, weighed on investor confidence.Markets started on Tuesday in a positive mood after better-than-expected results from healthcare sector bellwether Johnson & Johnson.The group’s profits jumped in the first quarter, breaking the run of bad earnings news from major US corporations that has undermined sentiment in the past two weeks.But the results left investors largely unmoved once trading began and the shares fell 0.1 per cent to $65.65 while an index of healthcare stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Technology companies also suffered after a series of earnings downgrades by analysts worried that a slowdown will hit profits. An index of technology stocks shed as much as 0.9 per cent before rallying towards the close.Computer component makers EMC and Emulex led the fallers, dropping 3.2 per cent to $14.17 and 6.3 per cent to $12.74 respectively after Citigroup downgraded the stocks.Cisco and IBM also lost ground, falling 0.9 per cent to $23.11 and 0.1 per cent to $117.17 respectively.First-quarter results from Intel, the leading semiconductor manufacturer and industry bellwether, should help reassure investors spooked by disappointing results from arch-rival AMD last week however. Intel said profits fell 12 per cent to $1.44bn but first quarter sales rose 9.3 per cent to $9.67bn. The shares fell 0.9 per cent to $20.75 in after-hours trading.Record oil prices and buoyant commodity prices lifted oil producers, material stocks and wider indices. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips added 1.2 per cent to $90.80 and 1.8 per cent to $81.24 respectively.Airline companies, however, fared poorly as analysts and investors worried that rising fuel costs would eat up any benefits from recent moves to consolidate the industry.Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines jumped in pre-market trading after they agreed to a $3.63bn merger, but by the close Delta shares were down 12.6 per cent to $9.66. Northwest fell 8.4 per cent to $10.28."
515;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;HSBC to switch debit cards of 10m customers;;HSBC is to switch over the debit cards of 10m customers from Maestro to Visa, in a move that has angered retailers.The UK’s biggest bank plans to start reissuing the debit cards of current account customers at the end of this year and the changeover will be completed by 2010.However, the move has been attacked by retailers who claim that they will have to pay 34 per cent more in card transactions – charges levied by card companies on retailers for completed sales.The British Retail Consortium has written to stores to warn them that the change could result in an estimated increase in fees from 5.97p to 8p a transaction.The industry body believes HSBC’s decision will cost traders an extra £25m ($49m) a year in charges at a time when they are struggling with rapidly rising bills.“With HSBC accounting for 40 per cent of the market in personal debit card transactions, retailers will be paying out millions more while getting precisely no extra service in return,” said Stephen Robertson, director general of the BRC.“With rulings and enquiries turning the tide against some of the card companies’ unjustifiable fees it’s clear they are exploiting other ways of recouping lost revenues,” he said.HSBC says it is making the change so customers will be able to use their cards more widely at retailers overseas. It says Visa allows greater international usage for customers than Maestro.While Maestro can be used across Europe, it cannot be widely used in the US or in Asia. In addition, Visa offers customers some protection if goods bought on their card are damaged, for example. The cards will be issued to its personal, commercial and First Direct current account customers.Peter Robinson, commercial manager at DSG International, the electrical retailer that operates Currys and PC World, argued that few customers would benefit from a card that could be used in the US and the UK while all retailers would suffer from higher charges that would be passed on to the customer via higher prices.“This is a direct cost to the retailer,” he said. “The benefit to the average customer is going to be marginal.”Visa Europe said on Tuesday that the merchant service charge was only one part of the overall transaction fee. This would vary according to deals struck between retailers and their merchant acquiring banks which provide chip and pin terminals.
516;V;Visa Inc;2008-03-27T22:17:38Z;Number of abandoned IPOs surges;;The number of companies abandoning plans to raise capital through initial public offerings in the first quarter of this year jumped to heights not seen since the collapse of the dotcom boom, according to Dealogic, the data provider.A total of 90 IPOs were withdrawn or postponed in the quarter, up from 78 in the fourth quarter of 2007. In the first quarter of 2001, 93 deals were put on ice.“When the markets catch a cold, the IPO market catches pneumonia,” said John Crompton, head of equity capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Merrill Lynch.In the first quarter, global IPO volume sank 11 per cent compared with the same period in 2007 to $36.3bn. A single IPO from credit card group Visa, which raised $19.7bn, accounted for more than half the total.IPO deal volume in Europe, the Middle East and Africa plunged by 91 per cent to a meagre $1.6bn, compared with $17.3bn in the same period last year.Asia Pacific defied the gloom, with a 14 per cent annual rise in first quarter IPO volume to $8.9bn (excluding Japan and the China A-share market).Chinese IPO volume surged 46 per cent to $8.5bn in the first quarter.The landmark Visa deal led a 144 per cent surge in US deal volume to $24.8bn, but the number of deals fell 64 per cent to 21 over the same period.“Visa was a watershed, must-have transaction in terms of size, liquidity, brand-name and global reach. The reception for that transaction shows that for the right names at the right price there is ample liquidity,” said Viswas Raghavan, head of debt and equity capital markets at JPMorgan. However, the majority of companies aiming to go public are small and mid-cap names with a short business track record, bankers said.
517;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Brussels probe into Visa Europe’s cross-border fees;;Visa Europe, a franchise of the world’s biggest credit card network, is under investigation by European Union competition authorities over the cross-border fees it sets for transactions.Wednesday’s move by the European Commission follows its ruling that similar charges set by MasterCard breach EU rules. The crackdown may hit revenues at banks that issue cards.The probe into Visa Europe will look into interchange fees paid between the banks servicing shops that accept credit and debit cards, and those that service cardholders.Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, has said such fees act as a tax on consumption for all shoppers and has ordered MasterCard to change its method for setting the charges. Yet, the Commission said the start of proceedings into Visa Europe did not imply it had proof of an infringement.Retailers, who pay interchange fees on card transactions, welcomed the move. The British Retail Consortium said the fees were much higher than the costs card companies incurred in processing transactions and that there was no transparency over how they were calculated.The European Retail Round Table said that Ikea paid €90m ($142m) annually and Tesco paid about €128m in fees to the banks for processing credit and debit cards.Derek Chambers, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, told Bloomberg: “The interchange fee is probably set at well over what it actually costs the process, and the gap has been a substantial source of revenue for the banks’.“If it is lowered or removed, it would free up competition and that could mean lower fees for banks.’’In 2002, Visa International reached a settlement with the Commission to resolve a dispute over interchange fees, agreeing to reduce the charges progressively.However, that deal expired last year and Visa Europe said on Wednesday it sought a new agreement with the regulator. “We see no evidence that Visa Europe’s interchange has acted as a tax on consumption. The net result of a substantial reduction in interchange would see a disproportionate shift in the costs of the card payments system from retailers to consumers.”Visa Europe is owned by its 4,600 European member banks and last year became independent of Visa, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange this month.MasterCard this month launched a legal challenge to the Commission’s ruling in December.The company was told either to revise its method for setting the charge within six months or face fines.If Visa Europe were found guilty of using restrictive business practices, it could face similar potential penalties to Mastercard.
518;V;Visa Inc;2008-03-19T21:05:31Z;Barren times for US flotations;;"Visa’s record $17.9bn initial public offering is the exception rather than the rule in a barren US IPO market this year, where several deals have been pulled or postponed until capital raising conditions improve.Just 24 deals have been priced so far in the US this year, the lowest level for the first quarter since 2003. The 23 deals other than Visa’s raised a combined $4.5bn. In the same period last year, 67 deals came to market, raising a combined $12bn.An even bigger contrast is provided by the first quarter of 2000 at the height of the dotcom boom, when 140 companies floated in the US, raising $34.7bn.Global listings data are also showing wider pain. IPOs have raised a total of $34.2bn through 175 deals so far this year compared with $33.5bn and 298 deals for the first quarter last year.In February only four companies went public in the US, raising just $122m, the smallest number of deals to come to market in a month since August 2003, when just three companies went public. It was also the smallest amount raised in a month since June 2003, when IPOs generated $97m.One analyst says it is not surprising that the IPO market has pretty much dried up given concerns surrounding the slowing economy, weakness in the financial sector, the skyrocketing price of oil and the plummeting dollar.Although the pipeline for forthcoming IPOs remains strong, companies in general are taking a wait-and-see attitude amid the continuing uncertainty about the fundamental health of capital markets and worries about a global slowdown.Visa’s share price was up 33.5 per cent by midday on its first day of trading on Wednesday. Its success owes much to a business model that in essence gives it negligible credit risk.Other companies, particularly in the financial sector, have had to postpone floats because of their susceptibility to problems in the wider credit markets.This week alone, two prominent planned flotations, Renewable Energy Group and Pogo Jet, were postponed.AQR, the quantitative hedge fund run by Cliff Asness, has put plans to float on the back burner for months as it waits for the capital raising environment to show signs of stability.Alternative investment companies in particular have met mixed fortunes after deciding to go public. Och-Ziff and Fortress, which floated last year, are both trading significantly below their offer price.Shares in Blackstone, the private equity group that went public in June, are
also well below their $31 offer price.Citadel, the hedge fund group run by the billionaire Kenneth Griffin, recently separated its hedge fund business from an options market-making unit, thereby raising the prospect that it will pursue a stock market flotation.Of the 24 companies that have listed in the US so far this year, half have come from special purpose acquisition companies, according to figures from Dealogic, the data provider. Spacs raise money in order to pursue the acquisition of an existing company.Halcyon Asset Management will become the latest alternative investment company to go public after agreeing to be bought by such a company."
519;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa shares surge as trading begins;;Shares in Visa, the world’s largest credit card network, soared on their stock market debut, gaining 36 per cent and adding more than $15bn to the company’s market value.Visa started trading at $59.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday following its record $17.9bn initial public offering, the largest in the US. The shares ended the session at $56.50, up 28.4 per cent.Shares had been priced at $44, above the expected range. Its market capitalisation of $56.8bn at Wednesday’s share price ranks Visa among the world’s largest financial services houses, ahead of companies such as Merrill Lynch and UBS.The spectacular debut coupled with a series of positive quarterly earnings reports from banks and the actions of the Federal Reserve this week have raised hopes that the outlook may be more positive for the ailing financial services sector.Chip MacDonald, a partner at Jones Day, the law firm, said the offering had very tangible benefits to the financial services industry – more than $10bn of the offering’s proceeds will go to Visa’s bank members, increasing their income, capital and liquidity.He added that the effects on the subdued US IPO market more generally were unclear.Visa is a well-established business with a strong brand and crucially, little credit risk, most of which is passed on to the banks that issue its cards.At a minimum, he said Visa’s success should help open the markets for secondary capital raises by financial services firms.Visa had decided to go ahead with the offering in spite of recent nervousness in equity markets and the continuing threat of a global economic slowdown.JPMorgan Chase, which this week agreed to buy Bear Stearns for just $2 a share in a fire sale engineered by US regulators, stands to make about $1.2bn as Visa’s largest selling shareholder.Bank of America will make about $600m and Citigroup $300m. The banks will cash in about half their stakes.About $3bn of the proceeds will go into a fund to protect investors from legal claims. Visa faces actions alleging anti-competitive practices.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the issue. Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Wachovia also worked on the flotation.
520;V;Visa Inc;2008-03-18T23:46:08Z;Visa stages largest ever US IPO;;Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit card network, on Tuesday set a record for US initial public offerings by raising $17.9bn, providing a welcome windfall to several prominent US banks.Visa had decided to go ahead with the offering in spite of recent nervousness in equity markets and the continuing threat of a global economic slowdown. Tuesday’s pricing came after financial shares rallied strongly on hopes that the worst of the recent credit market turmoil might be over.The company’s shares priced at $44 per share, which was above the pre-IPO range of $37 to $42. They will begin trading under the ticker “V” on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.If the company decides to float its share overallotment – an additional 40.6m shares – the IPO would raise as much as $19.65bn, almost double the $10.6bn record for a US listing set by AT&T in 2000. The proceeds from the IPO will help leading banks boost their profits at a time when credit market problems have reduced revenues from many of their traditional activities.JPMorgan Chase, which this week agreed to buy Bear Stearns for just $2 per share in a fire sale engineered by US regulators, stands to make a gain of about $1.2bn as Visa’s largest selling shareholder. Bank of America will make about $600m and Citigroup $300m. The banks will cash in about half their stakes.Analysts said Visa and rival MasterCard are insulated from rising defaults and late payments because, unlike American Express and Discover Financial Services, neither of them actually extends credit to cardholders. The banks that issue the cards take the credit risk.Some analysts had said the company’s US bank shareholders may have put pressure on the company to proceed after the banks suffered heavy writedowns as a result of the US credit crisis.About $3bn of the proceeds will go into a fund to protect investors from legal claims. Visa faces legal actions alleging anti-competitive practices.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the issue. Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Wachovia also worked on the flotation.
521;V;Visa Inc;2008-02-25T22:11:30Z;Visa record;;"Here is a rare sight: a US financial company actually raising new capital from a position of strength. Visa, the credit card payment network, is set to pull in as much as $18.8bn from selling about half of its shares later this year. That would make it the biggest initial public offering in US history.At first sight, the timing looks challenging. The US financial system continues to take hits from all sides. The banks that control the Visa network have taken heavy losses on asset writedowns and are starting to take higher provisions on credit card portfolios as US consumers suffer.But that should not take a heavy toll on Visa’s transaction-based business. Not only is it geographically diverse, with growth particularly strong outside the US, but the group is in the middle of a secular expansion story as spenders round the world move from cash and cheques towards plastic. The share price of rival MasterCard tells the story. As other financial sector companies have seen their stock prices pummelled, its value has risen fivefold since its 2006 IPO.Visa will piggy-back off that performance. Not only has MasterCard provided a glimpse of the revenue growth potential but it has also given a taste of the potential for improved margins once the business is run as a true for-profit operation rather than as more of a utility for the banks.For capital-hungry banks it should provide a tasty windfall – even though JPMorgan, among the least needy, has a stake worth about $4bn while struggling Citigroup has one quarter of that.Of the cash being raised, $3bn will go into a fund to pay for ongoing litigation against Visa. But
a whopping $10bn will be used immediately to buy a chunk of the shares owned by big banks.So those same banks leading the deal have plenty of incentive to ensure a healthy offer price rather than leaving lots of value on the table as MasterCard, in retrospect, appears to have done. Do not expect Visa to enjoy a rerun of its smaller rival’s share price bonanza.Post and read comments on this Lex"
522;V;Visa Inc;2008-02-25T20:22:21Z;Visa plans record $19bn listing;;Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit card network, said on Monday it was hoping to raise up to $18.8bn in its long-awaited flotation, which will bring a badly needed financial boost to some of the US’s biggest banks.Visa has decided to press ahead with what will be the largest ever initial public offering in the US in spite of nervous equity markets and the threat of a global economic slowdown.Michael Lafferty, head of Lafferty Group, a card consultancy, said the decision to go ahead may reflect pressure from its US bank shareholders which include Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.“All of these banks suffered heavy writedowns in the wake of subprime mortgage difficulties, and the proceeds from Visa’s IPO would go some way to alleviating pressure on their 2008 results.”Ironically, the biggest shareholder, JPMorgan Chase, is one of the strongest of the top US banks. It stands to make a gain of about $4bn, Bank of America will make about $2bn and Citigroup $1bn. The banks will cash in about half their stakes.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the issue.Visa’s IPO, which is expected in March or April, comes two years after the flotation of MasterCard, its smaller rival which was also owned by its bank members. The shares have soared by more than 400 per cent. The Visa IPO will overshadow the $10.6bn record for a US listing set by AT&T in 2000.Both networks, which process transactions for the banks that issue their cards, have been helped by strong global economic growth and rising international travel, which has boosted lucrative cross-border transactions. They are also enjoying the rapid switch from cash to card usage in fast-growing emerging markets.The company to be floated combines all Visa’s operations outside Europe. Visa Europe is to remain separately owned by its European member banks, which its board says will leave it better positioned to deliver a borderless payment market.According to Lafferty Group, the markets in which Visa Inc operates showed annual growth of billed volumes of 24.6 per cent over the past two years compared with 9 per cent in Europe.Some $3bn of the proceeds will go into a fund to protect investors from legal claims. Visa is facing legal actions alleging anti-competitive practices.
523;V;Visa Inc;2008-02-24T22:53:38Z;Olympic sponsorship set to hit $1bn for 2012;;The International Olympic Committee looks set to raise more than $1bn (£510m) from worldwide sponsorship in the four-year period culminating with the 2012 London Olympics.This would be the first time it has breached the $1bn barrier, confirming the Olympics’ enduring appeal as a marketing vehicle for multinational companies.Since its inception in 1985, The Olympic Partner (TOP) programme of the IOC has surged in value from an initial $96m. For the four years ending with the Beijing Olympics in August, 12 sponsors – including Coca-Cola, Visa and Samsung – have paid a total of $866m in cash and “value-in-kind” goods and services for the right to associate their names with the Olympics.Gerhard Heiberg, chairman of the IOC marketing commission, said: “We hope that the quadrennium we are talking about will reach around $1bn.” He said the IOC had secured nine worldwide sponsors for the 2009-2012 period and was talking to Johnson & Johnson, the US consumer products group that is another of the 12 current TOP sponsors, about becoming the 10th.The success of the programme bodes well for London 2012, as organisers of the two games in each quadrennium usually share about half of revenues raised.While London will stage the 2012 summer Games, the Canadian city of Vancouver will host the 2010 winter Olympics. Both are also seeking their own sponsors.Mr Heiberg, a 68-year-old Norwegian, said the IOC was looking for “one or two” more worldwide sponsors for 2009-2012 and confirmed it had held talks with Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy group.He said he had attended a meeting in Moscow in November and that there would probably be another in March. “We agreed this could be of interest to Gazprom,” he said, although neither party was “in a hurry” to conclude a deal.Mr Heiberg acknowledged that sponsorship by a state-controlled entity raised ethical questions that were still being discussed. “We think it will be OK,” he said.Russia last summer won the right to host the 2014 winter Olympics at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.Mr Heiberg also disclosed that the IOC had considered a new tier of sponsorship above the TOP sponsor level, but decided against it.Olympic sports take place in largely advertising-free arenas. But rights acquired by worldwide sponsors are substantial, and include use of the Olympic logo in advertising campaigns and corporate entertainment.Current TOP sponsors also include French IT services group Atos Origin, US conglomerate GE, Chinese computer maker Lenovo, insurer Manulife, fast food company McDonald’s, watch brand Omega and Panasonic, the electronic goods brand.Tug of war over endorsementThere is good and bad news for London 2012 in Gerhard Heiberg’s disclosures on sponsorship.The good news is that the chairman of the International Olympic Committee’s marketing commission hopes that its worldwide sponsorship programme for the four years culminating in the London Olympics will for the first time raise $1bn.The bad news is that Mr Heiberg has been in talks with Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, about becoming a worldwide Olympic sponsor. This threatens to complicate London’s efforts to secure its own deal with a leading oil company. At present it has high hopes for the sector, with one report suggesting it could yield £60m or more.Olympic sponsorship programmes operate on an exclusivity principle in each product category, so an IOC deal with Gazprom could make it difficult for the London 2012 organisers to sign up another oil company to meet their own sponsorship targets.Categories could be worded so London could still recruit an energy group - the worldwide programme could be allotted ”natural gas”, leaving ”oil” or ”petroleum” for London.But with another energy supplier already on board, the value of the deal could be reduced.

525;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Rising loan losses hit Capital One;;Capital One, the largest independent credit card company in the US, cut its profit outlook by more than 20 per cent on Thursday amid rising losses on loans in the fourth quarter and a slowing US economy.The warning sent its shares sharply lower in early trading, but shares later rebounded to close 1 per cent off at $42.92.Full-year earnings are now predicted to be $3.97 a share, lower than the company’s previous forecast of $5.00. Earnings for the fourth quarter, due out on 23 January, are expected to be 60 cents a share, including a 25 cents a share loss from the closure of its GreenPoint Mortgage unit in August.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.51 a for the fourth quarter and $4.98 for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income was $391m, or $1.14 a share, in the final quarter of 2006.As house prices fall and foreclosures and late payments on mortgages rise, concern has mounted that troubles in the housing markets will spill over into other areas of consumer debt such as credit cards and auto loans. Rising unemployment, which jumped to 5 per cent from 4.7 per cent last month, may also cut into consumer’s ability to pay off debts.Capital One’s warning was driven by increased loan loss provisions, amid mounting delinquencies on credit card loans, and legal reserves set up in the fourth quarter to deal with an antitrust case against Visa.The group expects to set aside about $1.9bn for loan losses in the quarter, including $1.3bn in charge-offs, or bad debt that has to be written off from credit cards and auto loans. Delinquencies and charge-offs rose during the quarter. Charge-offs for the year are now set to hit $5.9bn, against previous company forecasts of $4.9bn-$5.5bn.The loss provision includes $650m for delinquent loans, “continued deterioration” in the $700m in home equity lines of credit originated by GreenPoint and expectations of a weaker US economy in 2008.GreenPoint specialised in providing loans to subprime borrowers and so-called ”Alt-A ”, or near-prime borrowers, which it would then sell on to investors. It was forced to close after investors appetite for securities backed by mortgages collapsed.Moody’s, the rating agency, maintained its credit rating for the company but said it had noted “the recent trend of deterioration in asset quality in Capital One’s consumer businesses (and in the US consumer finance industry in general) and the expectation that such deterioration will continue into 2008.”Countrywide, the biggest US mortgage lender, also said on Wednesday that foreclosures and late payments rose the most in five years last month.Capital One said it also faced legal expenses of about $140m before tax in connection with the settlement of a Visa antitrust lawsuit with American Express, and in anticipation of future damages claims from other Visa lawsuits.
526;V;Visa Inc;2007-12-19T21:30:19Z;Brussels tells MasterCard to cut fees;;MasterCard was told on Wednesday it faces daily fines of up to $316,000 unless it slashes the cross-border fees it charges for credit and debit card payments.The credit card company was told by the European Commission it was in breach of competition rules by charging excessively high interchange fees which inflated costs to both retailers and consumers. Interchange fees are paid between banks servicing vendors and the banks servicing the cardholder.MasterCard said it would launch a legal challenge to the ruling which is expected to have wide ramifications. Brussels gave the company six months to withdraw its current fee structure or face heavy daily penalties if it failed to comply.The Commission said that these would be calculated at 3.5 per cent of the company’s global daily turnover in the previous year. MasterCard reported full-year revenues of $3.3bn for 2006. The Commission accused MasterCard of charging excessively high fees on cross-border transactions four years ago but the dispute dates back to complaints first received in the 1990s.MasterCard had said interchange fees were vital to facilitating transactions. In particular, it said its system balanced the costs and benefits between cardholders and retailers.Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, said the decision did not mean that all multilateral interchange fees were illegal.The decision was welcomed by retailers. The British Retail Consortium described it as a “major victory” while the European Retail Round Table, comprising leading multinational retailers such as Carrefour and Ikea said it should “open the way for national competition authorities to take similar action”.Up to 12 EU member states are believed to be looking at the legality of interchange fees although investigations are at differing stages. An Office of Fair Trading probe in the UK is the most public.Ms Kroes said the decision would provide more legal certainty. She said the Commission did not intend to prohibit all interchange fees. “Each and every scheme” would be examined on its merits.The Commission moved against MasterCard a year after Visa, its rival, struck a 2002 deal to exempt interchange fees for cross-border payments from competition rules in return for modifications, including a cut in fees.Visa’s exemption expired on December 31 and any fresh deal will have to be in line with the MasterCard findings.
527;V;Visa Inc;2007-12-18T17:36:21Z;Mastercard expected to appeal ruling;;Mastercard is widely expected to launch an appeal if, as expected, the European Commission finds that its interchange fees on cross-border payments breach competition rules in a decision due to be announced on Wednesday.Interchange fees are paid between banks servicing shops that accept credit cards and the banks servicing the cardholder. The European Commission accused the international payments company of charging excessively high fees on cross-border transactions in a statement of objections four years ago.Mastercard, however, claims that interchange fees play a vital role in facilitating transactions. Although the company declined to comment formally, sources close to Mastercard suggested on Tuesday that any adverse finding was likely to be appealed.The Commission also declined to confirm that it would make its findings public this morning, and it is possible that timing could slip. But Neelie Kroes, EU competitor commissioner, has acknowledged publicly that her department has been working hard on the case, and the matter is believed to have been discussed with representatives from national competition authorities - some of whom are also looking at the legality of interchange fees - last week.Several sources in Brussels said they believed a decision was imminent, and there is considerable pressure on the commissioner to release findings before the New Year.For example, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), designed to make cross-border banking and payments easier in the euro-zone, is due to come into force in January. The extent to which interchange fees are permissible could be highly relevant to this initiative.The Commission also moved against Mastercard a year after Visa, Mastercard’s rival, struck a deal with Brussels authorities. This exempted Visa interchange fees for cross-border payments from competition rules, in return for certain modifications by the payments company. However, the so-called ”Visa exemption” runs out on December 31, and any fresh deal might be affected by findings in the Mastercard case.Finally, national competition authorities in a number of EU member states - including the UK’s Office of Fair Trading - are looking at the legality of interchange fees, with investigations at differing stages. Commission findings could be highly relevant to their eventual decisions.
528;V;Visa Inc;2007-11-23T17:05:58Z;Deal of the Week: Amex Platinum MoneyBack credit card;;"American Express Platinum MoneyBack credit card paying a 5 per cent cashback on spending for the first three monthsWhat’s the deal?A 5 per cent cash rebate on all spending (up to £4,000) by new customers in their first three months of card usage.The cashback rate then switches to a tiered rate of just 0.5 per cent for spending up to £3,500 a year; 1 per cent on spending between £3,500 and £10,000; and 1.5 per cent over £10,000.Is it any good?Yes – this is the highest introductory cashback rate available covering all card spending. Abbey is offering 5 per cent but only on supermarket spending (and limited to a total rebate of £50 compared with Amex’s £200).The only comparable unfettered deal is Capital One’s Cashback with World Mastercard, which pays 4 per cent for three months and 1 per cent thereafter, and which also gives free worldwide family travel insurance for any holiday paid for on the card.Moneysavingexpert.com, the consumer advice website, describes Amex Platinum (which is also annual fee-free) as the “overall winner” among cashback cards.Its tiered rates – as well
as its higher introductory
rate – favour high spenders, and for some the Amex brand still also carries a certain cachet. But it is less accepted than Visa and Mastercard (particularly among smaller and independent retailers).Cashback credit cards are a good deal for those who pay off their bills in full each month, providing “free money” on spending that typically also beats returns available from points-based reward cards.They also allow cardholders to “double dip”. A cardholder can get cashback on the credit card at the same time as other rewards, for example by also using a supermarket’s loyalty card, or even two cash rebates by spending via an online cashback service such as Quidco.com or Topcashback.co.uk.Any other tips?Cashback credit cards don’t make sense for those borrowing on their plastic as interest charges – 18.9 per cent from Amex, for example – will more than offset any cashback earned. Anyone paying interest should look for a card with a promotional 0 per cent interest rate instead.Plastic offering interest-free finance can also work out a better deal than cashback for users who don’t need to borrow, say experts. These interest-free cardholders can in effect earn savings interest on their spending.How do I open an account?Go to www.american-
express.co.uk/moneyback or phone 0800 169 6767. Cashback junkies can also earn a cash rebate for applying for their card through a cashback website. Greasypalm.co.uk offers £22.50 for accepted applications."
529;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;A home from home;;"Born in Melbourne, Australia, the Venerable Kenneth Letts is Archdeacon of France. He and his wife, Isabel, have been based in Nice for 12 years. He broadcasts on Radios Chrétiennes Francophones and hosts monthly ecumenical meetings of all the city’s churches.Under the influence of Father Trevor Huddlestone of the Community of the Resurrection, I’d gone to England to follow three years of postgraduate study at the community’s seminary in Yorkshire. That was a complete change – things like the first time you see snow in your life. Food was a bit different – very Yorkshire. I couldn’t get over things like high teas, which were so copious. I was fascinated by the snow but when the cold wind blew up the Calder Valley that wasn’t good. And black ice was frightening.Years later, I was on a six-month sabbatical from my work in Australia. In Spain we were robbed and although we notified Visa International from the Australian Embassy, the bank in Australia didn’t take any notice. The thieves took all our money. I had to cancel my plans to be in Paris for three months doing studies. The chaplain of Nice had just retired and I was asked by the diocese to look after the chaplaincy of Nice and Vence for three months, on a part-time basis.I don’t have a sense of being ‘dépaysé’ at all. The first time I saw the Promenade des Anglais I had a real sense of déjà vu. Melbourne is also built on a bay with a great curve. And there’s an esplanade. It is longer than the Promenade but exactly the same: a broad footpath on the beach side with no streets crossing it, a median strip with palm trees and, on the other side, residences, mainly Victorian and Edwardian. I thought: “It’s like Beaconsfield Parade.” I made enquiries and found out that Beaconsfield Parade was designed by a guy from Nice, Monsieur Catani. It was a real sense of “I’m home”.Melbourne and Nice developed at much the same time. This part of Nice really took off in the 1860s, as did Melbourne because of the gold rushes, so the architecture is similar. My family home is like this home. In fact, it’s a bit older. And the climate is similar except in summer Melbourne is much more supportable because there’s no humidity; our heat comes from the desert. When I first came here and started to perspire heavily, which I’ve never done in my life, I thought: “I’ve caught something.”I was lucky enough to have French as a background (and spoken French,too) because the Australian government had sent me to do some work in New Caledonia. I was used to being in a French-speaking environment. Isabel did a degree in French and history. But your ear has to become accustomed to that again, too, because Australia is almost aggressively English-speaking. Although it’s very multicultural and you can read other languages in plenty you don’t hear them because everyone’s trying to speak English.I like to cook. We had a dinner for members of the ecumenical group. What I did was very simple: to begin with, mozzarella, tomato and balsamic vinegar. I’d cooked some fillets of beef that I’d rolled in pepper; I let them get not cold but tiède [warm], then I sliced them and served them with simply cooked beans – haricots – and a Roquefort sauce. We had fresh fruit as a dessert. That was easy to do. There were about 25 people here – priests, pastors and their wives. They loved it.We’re lucky, in the middle of Nice, to have a garden.It is a real jardin du curé.Isabel enjoys mixing with the local people – shopping, walking the dog. One thing that is different to Melbourne is still that ability to go out and have an affordable, good meal at lunchtime because they’ve got their plat du jour. We go to a little family-run Italian restaurant, Il Vicoletto, just behind here where we can have a first course and a main course for €9. It’s terrific to be able to do that.Our dog is a Cavalier King Charles.I’m fascinated by them. As an undergraduate my main period was the Stuarts; they were the Stuart dogs. The cat’s a lilac point Burmese. They’re beautiful animals and very affectionate. They get on like a house on fire.I was collated as archdeacon by our Suffragan Bishop in Arras at the Archdeaconry Synod. It does mean more travelling, although I would not have accepted the nomination if I felt that the community here was being neglected. My vocation is to be a priest, not to be an archdeacon. One is an order of ministry; the other is more administrative. I think I’ve been able to balance things.I do like wine. I’ve discovered two things here. The first is Provençal rosé wines; I don’t think that rosé will ever be a great wine but it’s delicious. The second is the wines of the Côtes-du-Rhône, which I knew vaguely but I’ve discovered more; I think they’re wonderful for their reliability and variety, whether it’s south or north. The presbytery here doesn’t have a cellar. Our home in Australia does: two rooms that are the bluestone foundations of the building. Bluestone is a local stone – very hard, durable and used for a lot of buildings. It’s a fine stone.When we arrived there wasn’t a flowering plant in the garden. I put in bougainvillea, jasmine, two lemon trees, a kumquat tree, a Kerria japonica. I put in couch grass, a durable, springy grass that stands dry weather. A lot of things I dug up myself from parishioners’ gardens in Vence. “We want to divide the agapanthus, could you help us?” they said. “Can I take some away?” It was the same thing with the irises. People who like gardens like sharing.I do find it exciting to work ecumenically in France; there’s a French mentality, ecclesiastically, which is very sharp, intelligent and creative. It’s very nice to be part of that. I’m the co-president of the Anglican-Roman-Catholic commission for France. We had a meeting in April in the Abbey du Bec in Normandy. It was just three days but there’s no getting away because you’re all together; you eat together, therefore meals are business meals, in a sense, all in French. It was exciting because it extended me.I’ve been blessed by the time I’ve been able to spend in France, very blessed indeed. It’s always a reason for thanksgiving. I love being in Nice. When I go I shall miss it but I will go."
530;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Out of MySpace;;Plenty of under-18s will think it is about time to force social networking sites such as MySpace to verify the age of their users: having your mum sign up and ask to be your friend is just sooooo embarrassing. Unfortunately for the teenagers, however, it is their access that a coalition of US attorneys-general wants to restrict. Although they are doing so for noble reasons – to protect children from abuse online – their approach is misguided.The attorneys-general are now threatening to take action against MySpace – the easiest target since joining the corporate mass of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation a couple of years ago – unless it takes steps to verify the age of under-18s who use its site.Concerns about child abuse are serious. The internet, with its reach, anonymity and pervasive presence, is a playground for predators, from stock manipulators to fraudsters to paedophiles. Children, who seize on the chance to play at adulthood without apparent consequences, are especially vulnerable.Age verification, however, just will not work. The practical problems are considerable. Fourteen-year-olds do not have drivers’ licences and credit cards that can be checked via established agencies. The sites could insist on verifying the parents, but anyone who believes that a teenager will not “borrow” his father’s Visa has never been 14 years old.The consequences of successful age verification, meanwhile, would be even worse. Minors would be driven off mainstream sites such as MySpace and Facebook and on to unaccountable offshore alternatives or the chaos of newsgroups and minor bulletin boards. There they would be far more vulnerable than on MySpace, which now makes efforts to keep tabs on its users.Children are not allowed to buy alcohol and tobacco, but we do not ban the under-16s from shops. Instead, we prosecute those who break the law and sell to minors. In the same way, there needs to be a greater effort, both by website operators and by the police, to catch and prosecute those who try to groom children for abuse online.That is unlikely to tempt an attorney-general as much as the high-profile scalp of MySpace, but given the weakness of the prosecutors’ case – it is not clear what existing law social networking sites have violated – they would do better to work with the websites than to attack them. Law enforcers should concentrate on catching criminals. Parents, meanwhile, should teach their children that MySpace is home to dangers greater than just some appallingly bad web design.
531;V;Visa Inc;2007-10-02T14:22:29Z;How the banks assess their customers;;"Nervousness in the world’s financial markets, sparked by sub-prime lending in the US, is causing banks and other financial institutions to take a closer look at their customers.Banks are tightening their lending policies to shield themselves from the possibility of debtors defaulting. Already, reports are emerging of banks shunning some categories of new borrower and limiting the credit available to existing ones.But how do they make these decisions?According to the British Bankers’ Association, banks now collect four kinds of data to assess client risk: negative data, such as county-court fines and convictions; “positive” information on people’s financial commitments and loans etc; income data; and reports on spending behaviour.Apacs, a UK association for the banking industry, says lenders tend to grab these from three sources – the electoral roll, their own systems, which are tied up with other payments organisations such as Visa, and credit checking agencies.“People are creatures of habit,” says Eric Leenders, executive director of the BBA. “You put a salary in your account once a month and may go to the supermarket weekly. From that analysis, you see the ability of someone to repay.“The software has to achieve the same end and banks all look at the same data.”While turning some customers away, banks are arguing that lending criteria are unchanged. Mr Leenders says this is true: “Banks have not recently changed the lending criteria. All they do is raise or lower the threshold score. When you raise the bar, fewer people are accepted for credit. The name of the game is to minimise the risk of whom you lend to.”Methods used to assess customers, on the other hand, have changed. Lenders now either use their own analytics software, or systems from vendors, such as Fair Isaac. These can calculate a customer’s risk based on the available data. HBOS bank, for example, uses Callcredit’s software to monitor missed payments in a bid to intervene on bad debts before they mount up.“The data is held entirely within the bank’s own systems,” says Ian Turvill, a senior director at Fair Isaac. “What may be common across banks is the expertise in developing the analytics that review the data to work out whether delinquency or bankruptcy is likely to take place.“Most banks have automated links with the credit agencies – now typically using web services – that deliver data automatically into the customer databases. The banks rely on the internal quality processes that the agencies apply to ensure that the data is of an appropriate integrity.”Martha Bennett, director of research for financial services at analyst Datamonitor, adds: “There is always an issue around a neural network and predicting the propensity of someone who will fail on a loan. The technology is reasonably sophisticated with that, but the problem is what do you do with the result?”Today, the same type of CRM systems that allow retailers to monitor spending of customers who carry loyalty cards also run in banks, and these enable them to build more accurate profiles. Combined with predictive software, this can be a powerful alarm system.“If a business with a fleet of cars has a cash crunch, they will commonly send out the vehicles to fuel up,” says Carl Clump, chief executive of Retail Decisions. “They’ll break through their credit limits all at once.“You can see similar acts with consumers – if you start to see lots of expenses on payment cards for food shopping, way more than usual, it would seem they are having a cash crunch.”Mr Turvill adds: “There is a whole class of applications called credit account management systems, including Fair Isaac’s Triad and Probe from Experian, the credit-checking agency. They are sometimes classified as CRM systems, but they are distinct. They are linked to what is called the master data file, a centralised database maintained by the credit card companies.”Zopa, by contrast, is an online service that allows individuals to lend and borrow money from each other. For its business to operate and to gain the trust of lenders, it bought software from SAS, the data-mining company, to help with credit scoring. It now boasts a “bad-debt rate” of some 0.05 per cent. This is because the company’s IT system performs real-time authentication and credit checks with the Equifax credit rating body. The software then scores the customer into one of four bands: A*, A, B or C.“But over the industry in general there is still some difficulty in getting a single view of a client,” says Bart Patrick, head of risk strategy for SAS. “You basically have various systems linking up the client records.“We do customer experience analytics – looking at what a customer buys and what they could buy. We are getting demand for joining up lending and marketing systems.”Sources close to the banks, which are reluctant to talk about decision-making processes, say lenders also demand more real-time information.With increasing sales of financial products over the internet, banks require faster answers on applications for instant mortgage quotes, for example.But again, this means greater sharing of data, which raises serious security questions over how safe that information is.Data protection laws are set in many countries to prevent data being shared without consent of the subject. Banks argue this is optional, but in many cases an individual cannot apply for a loan without providing that consent.“Lenders are sharing more information and that means a more informed decision,” says Peter Brooker, director of public affairs for Experian. “The information we hold is by consent. A lender cannot search your credit report without your consent. It must be fully transparent.”"
532;V;Visa Inc;2007-08-08T21:21:54Z;Stringent vetting fails to halt visa applications rise;;Visa applications have jumped by more than a half since 2001 in spite of more stringent vetting and tighter security measures, according to government figures released on Wednesday.Cheaper air travel and an economic boom in countries such as India and China have underpinned soaring demand for tourist, student and work visas to the UK, say Whitehall officials. Last year, almost a fifth of the 2.75m visa applications came from India alone.Refusal rates have also been climbing as authorities have tried to clamp down on potential security threats since the terrorist attacks of September 2001. The percentage of applications being turned down has more than doubled in the past six years from 9 to 19 per cent.Yet people seeking to visit Britain seem undeterred by the tighter monitoring – including compulsory fingerprinting at some embassies – and applications and visa grants continue to rise.Last year more than 2.2m visas were awarded, a 40 per cent increase since 2001. Total applications have more than doubled over the past decade and rose by 8 per cent this year.The Conservatives argued that the rise, which came in a year when many thousands of central and eastern European workers started to work in Britain, supported their policy of controlling immigration more tightly.“This is why Conservatives are calling for an explicit annual limit on economic migrants from outside the EU so the government can respond to real world conditions,” said Damien Green, shadow immigration minister.The annual report from UKvisas, an agency run jointly by the Foreign Office and the Home Office, showed a wide geographic variation in acceptance rates.While 40 per cent of applications in Islamabad and more than half of applications in Lagos were turned down, just 5 per cent of hopefuls submitting forms in Istanbul were refused access.A scheme to fingerprint and photograph those seeking visas in the UK, introduced last year, identified more than 6,000 “individuals who are of concern” – including failed asylum claimants – by cross-referencing the information with existing records.The government plans to extend the compulsory biometric testing to all 146 of its visa operations around the world by the end of 2008. The steps follow the lead of the US, where those without a US passport are photographed and fingerprinted on entry to the country.Gordon Brown recently proposed a new “unified border force” combining customs and immigration officials as part of measures to prevent terrorism.
533;V;Visa Inc;2007-06-21T19:18:47Z;Pay By Touch puts its finger on loyalty;;In Citigroup’s most recent annual report, the world’s largest financial company began its list of achievements in 2006 with its launch of a biometric credit card in Singapore.Citi card customers can now buy film tickets, Japanese food, or drinks at the Zouk night club by pressing their finger on a scanner, typing in a personal number, and automatically debiting their card.Meanwhile, shoppers at several Shop’nSave supermarkets in Pittsburgh are signing up for SmartShop, a card-based loyalty system that directs special offers to each customer based on their previous shopping history.Both Shop’nSave and Citi are using technology developed by Pay By Touch, a rapidly expanding privately held company that wants to shake up a global payments industry dominated by Visa, MasterCard and American Express.Over the past three years, Pay By Touch’s biometric network has expanded from a pilot scheme at Piggly Wiggly supermarkets in South Carolina to more than 3,000 locations, including the Jewel-Osco chain in Chicago, part of Supervalu.Supervalu, the second largest traditional US grocer, remains the system’s largest client, although a senior executive from the UK’s Tesco last year highlighted Pay By Touch’s system in a review of new payments technology – noting in particular the potential for integrating biometrics into its current ClubCard loyalty scheme.Several factors lie behind the surge in interest. The biometric system still allows a customer to choose from an “electronic wallet” of payment methods, such as direct debits, credit card accounts, or state food benefits.But for retailers such as Shop’nSave the system offers the possibility of reducing cheque processing costs by making it easier for customers to pay from their bank accounts.But it also offers the ability to ensure that the mountains of data on customer habits accumulated using retailers’ loyalty cards is accurate – since purchases can be tied to the biometric identity of the customer, rather than to a transferable card with questionable or out of date information on the customer.Beyond simple payments, Pay By Touch has sought to move further into customer loyalty with its SmartShop technology – which uses proprietary software to offer weekly incentives and special price cuts to an individual customer based on their shopping habits and preferences.For retailers, the system offers a way to direct offers effectively to their most loyal customers, rather than supporting “cherry picking” of bargains by customers who only buy the offers.John Morris, president and chief operating officer of Pay By Touch, says that pilots of the technology in Pittsburgh and New York have seen the card-based technology adopted by about 20 per cent of the participating store’s customers – against the estimated 1 per cent of customers who respond to traditional mailings of coupons.“Our data suggests they’re doing more of their shopping at the store where they’re getting their offers,” says Mr Morris, a veteran of IBM.Pay By Touch now has about 800 employees and is largely unchallenged by biometric competitors, since it acquired its main rival in 2005.It has also won $167m in financial backing, including support from Ron Burkle, the billionaire investor who made his reputation in retail.
534;V;Visa Inc;2007-06-05T23:19:54Z;Wal-Mart to launch payments card;;Wal-Mart plans to launch a payments card aimed at the estimated 80m US residents who do not have access to a bank account.Called the Wal-Mart MoneyCard, the prepaid product would be launched with GE Money, the retailer’s financial partner, and would be branded a Visa card, Wal-Mart officials said. An official announcement of the pilot programme could come as soon as this month.The venture represents a significant expansion of Wal-Mart’s financial services offered to mostly low-income customers, which include low-cost cheque-cashing and money-transfer services.It also follows the decision this year to abandon a bid to win a state banking licence in the face of a storm of opposition from the banking industry.Prepaid gift cards are popular in the US, generating a market worth $76bn last year. But Wal-Mart hopes customers will use the cards as quasi-bank accounts to access a range of financial services.The card would be modelled on the existing Visa Prepaid card, which lets holders have their weekly wages credited to the card, or to top it up at a range of locations, including supermarkets and convenience stores. The card would have a $3,000 limit, with the balance covered by federal deposit insurance through GE Money Bank.Reloadable cards, purchased without paperwork, are also seen as potentially attractive to the estimated 12m undocumented workers in the US.Visa’s Prepaid cards are used by more than 30 states, including California, to pay child and unemployment benefits.Visa estimates 80m people in the US lack a traditional banking relationship. It believes a worker without a bank account spends more than $300 a year in fees, a sum which can be reduced to $130 using a prepaid card.Card users can be charged for services such as paying bills and ATM withdrawals.In addition to low fees, Wal-Mart is expected to offer further incentives to support the expansion of its branded prepaid card.Its own-brand credit cards, issued by the Discover network, offer holders a 3 cents per gallon discount on fuel at Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club petrol stations.Wal-Mart says it sees its financial services as a way of supporting customers. While it does not break down revenues from financial services, executives say the division is a growing contributor to earnings.
535;V;Visa Inc;2007-05-18T21:00:48Z;New technology killing off cash;;Conrad Chase, British co-owner of the VIP Baja Beach Club in Barcelona, makes an unlikely human debit card.Mr Chase and almost 100 other clubbers have opted to have tiny data chips implanted surgically under their skin. When they want to buy a drink, they simply wave their techno-enabled arms across the counter.The chip, made by the VeriChip Corporation, is only the size of a grain of rice but can transmit an ID number to a scanner allowing money to be taken from clubbers’ bank accounts.Mr Chase may be an extreme example but he demonstrates a wider point: Britons are rapidly embracing the cashless society. The Association for Payment Clearing Services, the UK industry body, forecasts that in less than a decade fewer than half of all payments will be made by cash.Banks, including HBOS, HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, are surfing the cash-free wave by introducing new credit and debit cards. Customers will be able to pay for items under £10 by tapping the cards on a terminal at the till – much as they would a transport fare card.Sandra Alzetta, head of innovation and acceptance at Visa Europe, says this will speed transactions:.“Until now, cash has been king. Other methods have been too slow or too expensive for small ticket items with values of less than £10,” she said. “But contactless payments are much quicker than cash. If you’re buying a coffee or doing a grocery top-up, speed matters a lot.”Payment by mobile phone is also starting to take off.This week, the Post Office announced an electronic money-transfer service that allows recipients to receive funds using a bar code sent to a mobile or email address.The service is intended to allow companies to distribute promotional incentives and cash payments for less than the cost of a cheque. Companies send a reference code by text message or email, which customers take to any UK post office to receive instant payment.Visa is already testing a system in France that will allow consumers to pay for goods via mobile phone. In Britain, items such as parking and London’s traffic congestion charge can already be paid in this fashion.Another way cash is being edged out is through pre-paid cards that can be loaded up with cash and used like a credit card. PSE Consulting, the European payment consultancy, estimates that the total number of pre-paid cards issued in the UK will rise from 2m currently to 44m by 2010.Those who cling stubbornly to pounds and pence may even pay a price for their intransigence. Some utility companies have already started to penalise households who settle their bills by cash or cheque. BT has introduced a £4.50 charge for the millions who do not pay by direct debit.But the international experience suggests that Britain can expect even more striking developments in the future. A “pay-by-mobile” system already operates in Japan. In Texas, 500 people are taking part in a trial using a MasterCard PayPass to buy items from 7-Eleven stores via Nokia mobiles. Customers tap their pass or phone on to a specially equipped merchant terminal.But not everyone believes that cash has had its day.Jonathan Charley, vice-president of financial services at the business and technology company EDS, questions whether retailers will be willing to join the “tap and go” revolution if they have to bear the costs of rolling out the system.Commenting on Visa’s declared wish to turn the 2012 London Olympics into a cashless event, he said: “I think a cashless Olympics is a good vision but will not be achieved unless retailers and small businesses have the devices to read cards. Who is going to be paying for the devices and using the service – the consumer, retailer or the banks?“He added that the contactless card scheme also assumed that consumers had a bank account. “The challenge is that the contactless scheme [in London] can’t be used by those who don’t have a bank account. A whole swathe of people could be excluded from being able to take advantage of these new services.”Nicola O’Reilly of the National Consumer Council said: “We have concerns around security and the ability of consumers to keep track of what they’re spending, which is an essential part of budgeting. If any of these systems are only available to credit-card holders that would be unfair to those who do not have cards.”Matthew Knowles, from the Federation of Small Businesses, pointed out: “Small businesses would need to know that the systems were secure and they would not be liable if there was fraud in the system. We would also need to make sure small companies were not disadvantaged if they didn’t have the technology.”

537;V;Visa Inc;2007-01-29T19:13:53Z;Brussels to launch attack on bank fees;;Retail banks and credit card companies in the European Union will face sharp criticism from the region’s top antitrust regulator on Wednesday, following an inquiry that found evidence of artificially high fees, anti-competitive practices and a lack of cross-border competition.The report detailing the European Commission’s findings, a copy of which has been obtained by the FT, states: “In some member states the combination of high profits, a high level of concentration and the existence of barriers to market entry is worrying, with the banks being able to abuse their market power towards consumers and small businesses.”The Commission’s investigators are particularly harsh on the region’s savings banks and co-operative banks, which enjoy big market shares in countries such as Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Brussels warns that the high degree of co-operation between these banks, including the refusal to compete with each other in local markets, may raise antitrust concerns, and promises closer scrutiny of the banks and of national laws that protect them.Noting that only a tiny number of consumers switch banks, the Commission report also hits out at “certain banks that create artificial barriers which increase switching costs for consumers and reduce the intensity of competition”. Retail banks that make the sale of one product dependent on another or that impose fees for closing an account are singled out for criticism.The inquiry, which was launched in June 2005 by Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, warns credit companies such as Visa and MasterCard – which have already faced Brussels antitrust probes – that the Commission intends to “resolutely apply” competition law in their sector.It warns in particular that “interchange fees” – the charges paid between banks servicing retailers and the banks servicing cardholders – raise competition concerns in several member states.However, the report does not call for the abolition or even a further specified reduction in fees, even though Ms Kroes has in the past hinted at drastic action in this area.The apparent softening in the Commission’s position on credit card fees is likely to please Visa and MasterCard, which have warned repeatedly that the abolition of interchange fees would throw Europe’s payment card system into chaos. At the same time, the two groups and other payment card operators could be frustrated at the lack of clear direction from Brussels, which suggests the legal uncertainty hanging over the sector may continue.The sector inquiry forms part of a broader attempt by the Commission to get a grip on crucial sectors of the economy in which it believes that competition and cross-border trade is not working.The retail banking probe and similar investigations are not directed at individual companies, and therefore cannot directly trigger antitrust fines.However, officials hope the intelligence gathered during its inquiries will allow the Commission better to pursue individual infringements.

539;V;Visa Inc;2007-01-25T18:55:35Z;Banks to press retailers on data security;;A group representing leading US banks has launched an aggressive public campaign aimed at pressing retailers to tighten data security controls, following a substantial hacking breach affecting TJX, the discount retailer.The Massachusetts Bankers Association, whose members include Bank of America, Sovereign Bank and TD Banknorth, has this week issued statements highlighting the extent of the impact of the fraud on its clients, and attacking TJX for failing to protect its customers.The MBA said: “This would not be happening if the retailers had followed the standards laid out by the card issuers …so we’re taking an aggressive stance.”The MBA has taken a national lead in developing the banking industry’s response to security breaches, since a similar incident two years ago affecting BJ’s Wholesale Club, which like TJX is based in the state.The association is backing a bill about to be introduced into the state’s assembly that would require the party responsible for any security breach to reimburse banks for the costs of cards that need to be reissued, and for fraudulent transactions.“Those two expenses can be enormous for any financial institution,” the MBA said. “So we are saying why should we bear the cost, when we weren’t responsible for the breach?”The bill would also require the party responsible for the breach to inform its customers, rather than the current system which leaves this to the banks.TJX has said that it believes the amount of customer data removed from its system during the intrusions was relatively small, although the data potentially exposed extended to several of its store brands and to its TK Maxx stores in the UK and Ireland.The MBA says 60 of its banks have been told of cards being subject to fraud, with fraudulent payments in the US, Sweden and Hong Kong.The major credit card issuers issue fines of up to $10,000 per month for leading retailers who retain sensitive data, or who have failed to work towards compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI).Visa USA said in December it had issued $4.6m in fines in 2006, up from $3.4m the previous year.Visa said then that only 36 per cent of top US retailers were in compliance with PCI.The card networks do not identify retailers or others who are not in compliance with the PCI code, which requires independent certification of measures such as activity monitoring and encryption.Ted Julian, of Application Security, a supplier of data base security software, says the TJX attacks underline the challenges facing retailers in particular in seeking to secure data.“They have a lot of data that makes them more of a target, and they are geographically distributed, which also makes it harder.”
540;V;Visa Inc;2007-01-05T11:30:58Z;Credit card cash;;According to a survey out earlier this week, January 2 was the most depressing day of the year. With most of us having put on a few extra pounds and many bank balances having shed more than a few, this is hardly surprising.But if your finances are in poor shape, think twice before using your credit card to withdraw cash from a hole in the wall. This has always been one of the most expensive ways to get hold of money. In recent months it has become even more expensive.According to Moneyfacts, the comparison website, a large number of card providers increased their annual interest charges on cash withdrawals last summer, in some cases by as much as 5.4 percentage points. In addition, cash withdrawal charges have also been hiked. A year ago, the typical cash withdrawal charge was around 2 per cent with a minimum charge of £2. Now, cash withdrawal charges are around 2.5 per cent with a minimum charge of £2.50 or even 3 per cent (with a £3 minimum).Capital One charges the highest interest rates on cash withdrawals, according to Moneyfacts. As soon as you withdraw cash on a Capital One credit card from an ATM, you start clocking up interest at 34.94 per cent a year. NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclaycard are also expensive with NatWest and RBS charging annual interest on cash withdrawals of 23.01 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, and Barclaycard 27.9 per cent.Capital One also charges the highest cash withdrawal charges at 3 per cent with a minimum fee of £3, making this one of the most expensive ways of borrowing money. Saga’s Visa credit card is one of the most competitive for cash withdrawals, although still by no means a good deal. Its interest rate on cash withdrawals is 16.9 per cent with a cash withdrawal charge of 1.5 per cent (minimum £1.50).If you need to access cash using your credit card while abroad, expect even higher charges. In addition to high interest costs and cash withdrawal charges, you will usually be hit with an overseas currency loading, typically 2.75 per cent. Credit cards from Nationwide and the Post Office charge no currency loadings on overseas purchases or cash withdrawals.
541;V;Visa Inc;2006-12-26T18:55:07Z;Can train operators play their cards right?;;"Marine life is flourishing in the world’s subway systems. In Hong Kong there are Octopuses, in London Oysters, while Tokyo has Suica – watermelons – though they sport a picture of a harried commuter penguin so that is all right. They are “touch-and-go” contactless payment cards and, because of them, transport operators have a market opportunity that could be worth billions.That opportunity is to replace cash. Dollars and cents are a $1,200bn-a-year market in the US alone: charging retailers
half of 1 per cent would make
a tasty business. The subway cards contain a microchip and
tiny antenna, through which money can be loaded from a bank account and subtracted by a nearby scanner. There are no coins, no cash registers and no queues.What banks have been trying to create for decades – a working system of electronic cash – metro operators have managed in a couple of years.Crustacean and cephalopodan cards now lurk in the pockets of 20m affluent consumers. However, railwaymen cannot forget the tiresome business of running trains on time for a new career in banking just yet. They need shops to accept the cards, so a copy of the Financial Times and a cappuccino are bought as easily as a downtown subway ride. Octopus can now be used to buy groceries and enter your apartment block in Hong Kong. Repeat that success on a global scale and you can fund a lot of new subway lines.Octopuses, however, have predators, and more dangerous than a shark or conger eel are Visa and Mastercard. In the US, the credit card giants are moving in on transport systems with their own stored-value smart cards, though card names seem to evoke drug culture, with Breeze cards in Atlanta, Charlie in Boston, and SmarTrips in Washington DC.The transport companies, therefore, need a strategy and some imagination. In London, Oyster has cut a deal with Barclaycard and Visa: it will
get paid to help issue Visa contactless cards. Octopus is trying to persuade other cities to issue its cards and making them work for photocopiers, vending machines and taxis.There are even more ambitious possibilities. Operations such as Octopus and Suica could merge or simply co-operate so each card could work in the other system. Their parent companies could set them free: to raise capital, float on a stock exchange and make acquisitions. Or they could look for other ways to profit – marketing, for example, their voluminous data on how consumers move around cities.Visa and Mastercard need some competition and, for long-suffering commuters, it would be pleasant if profits from the cash business went to cash-strapped mass transit railways. The train companies have created a new business, won consumer acceptance and now they should try to make some money. Because, as anybody knows, inside every Oyster is a purse.The writer is an FT commentator"
542;V;Visa Inc;2006-11-05T21:59:57Z;Morgan Stanley and Visa settle dispute;;Morgan Stanley and Visa Europe have agreed to settle a long-running antitrust dispute, in a move that could bring to an end a six-year competition probe by the European Commission into the credit card group.The dispute broke out after Visa refused to let Morgan Stanley join its card network. The US investment bank had wanted to offer card services to shops and merchants in the European Union. However, Visa denied it access to its network, pointing to the fact that Morgan Stanley runs the Discover card in the US in competition with Visa.Morgan Stanley in 2000 filed a complaint to the Commission, which opened an investigation and in August 2004 issued formal charges against Visa accusing it of abusing a dominant market position. The credit card group has been waiting for a final decision, and a possible antitrust fine, ever since.According to executives from both groups, Visa and Morgan Stanley have now agreed to bury the hatchet. Morgan Stanley has become a member of the Visa card network, and in return has withdrawn its formal antitrust complaint to the Commission.The move follows last month’s decision by Visa Europe to split from the Visa group’s international operations.While Visa International decided to turn itself into a publicly-listed company, Visa Europe plans to retain its structure as an association owned and run by its member banks.Charlotte Hogg, managing director of Morgan Stanley’s consumer banking group international, said: “I can confirm that Morgan Stanley Bank has become a member of Visa Europe and that we have withdrawn our complaint to the European Commission about exclusion from membership of Visa Europe.”Visa Europe said: “We are very pleased that we have reached an amicable agreement with Morgan Stanley and have informed the European Commission about this new development.”The Commission declined to comment on the move. Formally speaking, the settlement between Visa and Morgan Stanley has no impact on the probe, although in practice it will be very difficult for the regulator to pursue an infringement already addressed by the parties.Should the deal with Morgan Stanley force the Commission to abandon its probe, it would remove the threat to Visa Europe of a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global annual turnover.However, Visa and its rival MasterCard still face pressure from the Commission to slash the fees they demand from retailers.Although Visa agreed in 2002 to lower these “interchange fees”, a recent Commission sector probe again hit out at what it describes as “excessive” charges.

Vadim Mamotim, director general of Mediaservice, the company that operates Allofmp3, argued that the service was legal under Russian law.He said the company was seeking direct negotiations over royalties with record labels, adding that ROMS, which operates Russian online store licenses, had offered to pay pay royalties to music companies but had “been rebuffed”.Copyright societies around the world have protested that they never entered licensing agreements with ROMS.The record industry has won a series of legal victories against peer-to-peer file-sharing services in the US that have forced many to either shut down or convert to a legitimate business model. In July, Shamran Netowkrs, the owners of KaZaa, one of the most infamous file-sharing services, agreed to pay $115m to settle legal action brought against them by the Recording Industry Association of America.Yet experts warn that new services have established themselves in country’s with more lenient copyright laws. One of the most popular, Pirates Bay, is based in Sweden. “It’s kind of like a game of whack-a-mole,” said Eric Custer, a partner at Manatt Phelps and Phillips. “Ever since Napster, you have all these other services popping up.”
544;V;Visa Inc;2006-10-11T22:40:34Z;Visa IPO;;Decisions made by committees are rarely speedy. That probably helps explain why it has taken Visa so long to unveil plans for turning itself into a listed company. For now, Visa remains a membership association owned by more than 20,000 financial institutions, which have yet to vote on the plan but look set to approve it now that the boards of various Visa entities have done so unanimously.Visa’s plans certainly make sense. Apart from helping finance growth, the new structure should also reduce regulatory scrutiny, to which Visa, along with its rival MasterCard, has been subject for more than a decade. Most of the credit card organisations’ antitrust and other legal troubles stemmed directly from cosy relations with member banks and floating them has long looked like a logical step.Visa should certainly benefit from the success of MasterCard’s flotation. The latter’s share price has risen by 80 per cent since its initial public offering in May. A valuation of about 25 times earnings for this year suggests that investors increasingly believe that nasty surprises from ongoing litigation should be limited. But while MasterCard’s new structure might help shift the potential liabilities – say for overcharging merchants – to its erstwhile member banks, it remains too early to tell if the company will escape altogether.At least Visa shareholders should have less to worry about than their MasterCard counterparts when it comes to the European business, which will remain a separate membership association and become a licensee. Visa’s larger scale, with roughly twice as many cards and two and a half times higher sales volumes than MasterCard, should make for juicy margins. Its market share gains in recent years also suggest healthy underlying business trends, while secular forces favouring plastic remain intact.As the ad says, “life takes Visa”. Investors would probably agree now. But they have plenty of time to lose their exuberance before Visa finally gets to price its shares.
545;V;Visa Inc;2006-10-11T22:07:55Z;Visa to go public in radical shake-up;;Visa on Wednesday responded to mounting regulatory and legal pressure by unveiling a bold plan to transform itself into a public company while separating its European arm from the rest of the global credit card network.The move comes less than six months after MasterCard, its main rival, completed a stock market issue partially designed to shield its member banks from lawsuits in the US. The shares, priced at $39 in May, ended trading just below $70 on Wednesday, valuing the company at almost $9.5bn. Analysts see Visa, expected to opt for a New York listing, as worth significantly more than $10bn.The shake-up, approved by the boards of Visa’s six regional operating companies, will see the 36-year-old group transformed from a network controlled by the world’s banks into a commercial organisation with a majority of independent shareholders.Visa and MasterCard face growing scrutiny from regulators and retailers who claim they impose artificially high charges on users.The growth of electronic commerce has made networks such as Visa, which handled payments worth $4,300bn in the 12 months to June, increasingly central to the functioning of the global economy.Visa’s European arm will remain an association owned by its member banks, operating as a licensee of Visa Inc, the proposed publicly listed company. Executives said the structure was designed to allow member banks to meet the demands of the European Commission, which is pressing for the creation of a Single Euro Payments Area by 2008.“Building this single market, which we wholeheartedly support, is unique to Europe and will require investment in infrastructure and very close co-operation between European banks,” said Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe. “We believe the association structure is the best way to facilitate this.”European bank executives said the Commission had indicated its preference for Europe’s payments infrastructure to be operated by European-owned companies. But Visa Europe’s decision also reflects the desire of its member banks to distance themselves from lawsuits in the US.Michael Lafferty, chairman of the Lafferty Group, a payments consultancy, said: “As of now, neither Visa nor MasterCard is Sepa-compliant, though Visa’s separate structure for Europe might give it a slight advantage in becoming compliant.”Peter Hawkins, a director of Visa International, said the restructuring would improve Visa’s efficiency while giving it access to external capital to fund growth in emerging markets. As part of the restructuring, Visa has started a search for a new chief executive to run the business.Visa Europe and its member banks are expected to pocket a substantial windfall from the flotation, expected to take place in 12-18 months.
546;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa to focus on developing Sepa regime;;Visa Europe’s decision to break away from the global group and maintain its structure as an association owned and controlled by member banks was on Wednesday explained by reference to the peculiarities of the European payment market.Visa executives pointed in particular to a landmark European Union effort to create a seamless, cross-border payments regime which will ensure that transfers between EU member states are completed as cheaply and simply as national ones.The regime, known as the Single Euro Payment Area, or Sepa, is intended to be up and running by 2008, and is seen by European policymakers as a cornerstone of their efforts to build a fully-functioning single market for financial services.Visa Europe said on Wednesday that its “membership-owned, not-for-profit association structure will enable it to remain focused on the development of the European internal market in payments and the Single Euro Payments Area”.Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the group’s structure was better suited to the demands of building and administering the complex infrastructure required to make Sepa work.He said: “If you are a publicly-owned company you have responsibility primarily for driving profit and not for building this infrastructure. The single market is absolutely unique to Europe. Nowhere else across the globe are countries trying to integrate different countries into a single payment area.”Mr Ayliffe said that Visa payment services would comply with Sepa’s requirements by the beginning of next year, but stressed that further investment and efforts would be necessary to operate successfully in this new commercial environment.One particular challenge would be to broaden the appeal of Visa Europe’s debit card, VPay, which currently lags behind rival MasterCard’s Maestro service.Industry experts pointed out that there were other differences between Europe and the rest of the world that may help explain Visa’s decision.One source highlighted the continuing regulatory risk faced by credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard in Europe.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, in April attacked credit card companies for making what she said were “outrageous” profits, and accused them of operating a “closed shop”, singling out Visa and MasterCard in her attacks.Another person familiar with the industry pointed out that the 4,500 banks that own and control Visa Europe had always shown a strong independent streak, and had been keen to keep the group’s New York headquarters at arm’s length.
547;V;Visa Inc;2006-10-11T18:10:26Z;IPO plan reflects desire to head off critics;;When Visa unveiled plans to abandon the ownership structure it has maintained for more than four decades, many of the world’s leading financial services executives were clustered at an industry conference in Sydney.The news, which reached Australia well into the evening, quickly became the main topic of conversation at the cocktail parties organised to coincide with Sibos, the payments industry’s main conference.Visa’s decision to become a public company reflects years of mounting pressure on the payments network. Both Visa and its main rival, Mastercard, have in recent years come under attack from regulators, who have sought to break open what they argued was a cosy cartel controlled by the world’s banks. At the same time large US retailers, who are the main users of the credit card networks, have launched a series of lawsuits that accuse Visa and Mastercard of maintaining the interchange fees they charge merchants for using their networks at an artificially high level.The increased scrutiny reflects the growing power of credit cards. In 1958, when Bank of America launched its BankAmericard – the card that later became Visa – few could have predicted the extent to which electronic payments would replace cash and cheques as the preferred method for consumers to spend money. The rapid growth in electronic commerce over the internet has further boosted the traffic over Visa and Mastercard’s networks: last year, Visa handled one euro in every ten spent by European consumers.At first glance Visa is imitating Mastercard, which became a public company through its successful initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year. Mastercard shares, which were priced at $39 in May, have risen to more than $70, valuing the company at around $9.5bn. Although Visa’s current structure makes it hard to compare the financial performance of the two companies, most analysts believe Visa would have a substantially larger market share than its rival.Like Mastercard, Visa is hoping that becoming a listed company with a majority of independent directors and more than 50 per cent of its shares held by public investors will help to protect its member banks from lawsuits in the US. Though the credit card operators have vigorously denied any liability, the threat of large financial penalties has cast a pall over the success of both networks.Yet in one important way, Visa’s structure is different from Mastercard. Rather than creating a single global holding company, Visa has decided that its European arm should remain a separate entity controlled by its member banks. In order to achieve this, Visa Europe will be granted an exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable licence to operate the Visa network.In the past, Visa Europe executives have voiced their vehement opposition to incorporation. And some analysts said on Wednesday the move appeared to be at least partially designed to shield Visa’s European members from any legal liability arising from the United States. The decision also appears to be aimed to improve Visa Europe’s chances of benefiting from the planned introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area, which starts in 2008.Sepa is aimed at allowing consumers and businesses to make international payments in euros as simply and cheaply as domestic transfers. Bank executives said the European Commission has indicated that it would not look favourably if the payments systems that formed part of Sepa were part of an organisation incorporated in the US.“The decision for Visa to stay as a member-owned not-for-profit was a unanimous decision by Visa Europe’s board,” said Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe. “It is the best way to address the unique challenges we face in Europe.”Jerry Norton, director of strategy (financial services) at IT consultancy Logica CMG, said the split would help Visa Europe deal with the substantial regulatory change coming through in the cards and payments area, including SEPA. He said: “Visa needs to ensure as an organisation it is compliant with these changes and needs to keep in mind the potential impact of the Payment Services Directive.“Having the European division of Visa as a separate entity will aid compliance and help corporate governance and ensure that the work going into Sepa and the PSD will continue uninterrupted.”Visa will now embark on the task of combining its operations around the world into a single entity, while recruiting a new chief executive from outside the company and filling a board with a majority of independent directors.For Visa Europe and its member banks, the main question is what kind of windfall to expect from the IPO.
548;V;Visa Inc;2006-10-06T16:04:31Z;Load ’em up and take hold of the readies;;"If you make a claim on your home insurance policy or step off a flight to find your luggage has not arrived with you, you may now find that you are reimbursed with a pre-paid card rather than cash or a cheque.Pre-paid cards – cards loaded with money that can then be withdrawn or used to pay for goods or services – have been in the UK for around five years. But over the past 12 months their presence has really taken hold.Consumers, especially those who do not have access to credit or debit cards, can obtain them without credit checks and they do not need a bank account. They are also increasingly popular with businesses looking for more efficient ways to pay staff and customers.PSE Consulting, the European payment consultancy, estimates that the total number of pre-paid cards issued in the UK will rise from 2m currently to 44m by 2010. It expects that by 2010, €15bn will be spent on pre-paid cards each year in the UK.MasterCard has tie-ups with airlines, including KLM and Austrian Airlines. These companies are using pre-paid cards to provide compensation to passengers who are delayed or have lost their baggage. British Airways is also looking at offering a Visa pre-paid card for the same purpose. Reuters, the media group, provides pre-paid cards for journalists to cover expenses while travelling overseas.Cards being used by businesses are generally Visa or MasterCard-branded as these cards can be used at any cash machine or retail outlet bearing the relevant logo. Cards that have a fairly small one-off balance – perhaps £50 or £100 – generally do not require a pin number or signature.According to Rich Wagner, chief executive of Advanced Payment Solutions, the main advantage of using cards instead of cash or cheques is that the money is instantly available to the cardholder, whereas cheques can take days to clear. Cardholders do not need bank accounts to use the card. These cards also provide a secure alternative to cash: if a card is lost or stolen, it can be immediately blocked and reissued by the provider, usually at no cost to the user.Insurance companies are also entering the pre-paid market. Norwich Union, one of the UK’s biggest insurers, gives customers the option of receiving their insurance claim on a pre-paid Visa Electron card.So, for example, if someone makes a claim for a stolen television or a piece of jewellery, the company might send out a pre-loaded card that can be used to pay for a replacement. This way the claimant gets the money instantly and does not have to pay out of their own pockets and then reclaim from the insurer.Cards issued by Norwich Union can only be used in a number of specific retailers.Carol Heath, head of pre-paid at Visa Europe, expects strong growth in the motor and health insurance industries. She says you could be issued with a card to pay for a course of physiotherapy, for example.Chris Reddish, head of pre-paid at Mastercard Europe, says another fast growth area is payroll. Recruitment agencies and contractors are using pre-paids to pay
foreign nationals or short-term workers. Fifa, the football association, paid short-term staff working at this year’s World Cup tournament via pre-paid cards.More traditional uses for pre-paid cards are also seeing strong growth. These cards were initially used as gifts, and as an alternative to travellers’ cheques. Now they are widely used online to purchase groceries, holidays or pay for services such as the congestion charge, council tax or broadband.Sales of MasterCard’s pre-paid card, Cashplus, are growing at a rate of 20 per cent every month, and people are increasingly loading on larger values. Almost £25m has been loaded on to the Cashplus card since its launch a year ago. Meanwhile, Visa has seen demand for its pre-paid cards quadruple in the past year.You can buy these cards online, by telephone or at retailers, such as money transfer agencies. MasterCard says its Cashplus card can be reloaded at 14,000 locations worldwide, including all Post Offices.The downside of these cards is that they are fairly expensive. You will typically have to pay £1-£2.50 to withdraw cash from ATMs in the UK and up to £3 overseas. There are also initial and monthly fees. According to Moneysupermarket, MasterCard’s Cashplus card costs £9.95 initially and then cardholders can pay a monthly subscription of £4.95 or £1 per transaction. Liquid, a card offered by Newcastle Building Society, charges the same initial fee but only a £2 monthly fee.Other cards designed for taking money abroad are cheaper. These are offered with no fee by Travelex and Western Union, although exchange rates may not be competitive. The Post Office charges £10 for its travel money card and American Express charges £20."
549;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
550;V;Visa Inc;2006-08-18T09:52:26Z;Robert Budden: Get set to shop the currency merchant;;Just before I went away on a week’s summer break, I wrote my column on dynamic currency conversion, a new wheeze whereby foreign banks and retailers impose their own currency conversion rates on debit and credit card transactions made overseas.This prompted a flood of reader responses with some horror stories and useful tips which I will share with you.But first let me quickly recap how dynamic currency conversion (DCC) works. When you use your debit or credit card overseas – whether to pay for goods or services or to withdraw cash from an ATM – it is likely that your card issuer will charge you a loading on the currency conversion rate, typically 2.75 per cent. However, in growing numbers of cases, you may be offered a DCC conversion rate alternative by a local bank. This usually equates to a loading of around 3 per cent and immediately converts the transaction into your home currency.Readers imparted some other interesting gems on DCC and using cards abroad. In my column I explained how the Nationwide Classic Visa credit card charges no currency loading on overseas transactions. This still holds. But you would not want to lose this card abroad as, surprisingly, it does not come with an emergency replacement service (its superior Gold Visa card does).Also watch out for card issuers that still levy their own currency loading charge even when you opt for DCC. This means you could end up paying a whopping loading of around 6 per cent. Ouch.This reader could not remember the name of the card issuer. But if you have come across this from a UK card issuer, do let me know.Finally not all DCC services mean you will end up worse off. One niche provider based in the US – Planet Payment – guarantees that its DCC rates will beat the currency rate of your card issuer. It tracks the currency loadings of card issuers and then undercuts them with its own conversion rate, refunding you 150 per cent of the difference if you are worse off.The real point of all this is that, at the time of the transaction, you should be offered a choice of whether to stick with your card issuer’s own conversion rate or go with the local alternative.It is clear from reader correspondence that some cardholders are not being offered this choice and, on occasion, when they ask for their card issuer’s rate they are being sternly refused.One reader tried complaining to the Financial Services Authority, Visa, his card issuer Barclaycard and to Apacs, the UK payments association. But to no avail.So who should you complain to when you return from holiday? The answer is your card issuer. Barclaycard says it will investigate all card complaints and, if it finds in your favour, will refund the original transaction and put it through again on its loading rate that applied at the time.In most cases a call to customer services should suffice, although from reader correspondence it appears some customer service reps are still unaware of DCC.Bodies such as Visa also operate their own code of practice. So if, for example, a retailer is not offering you a choice, you should inform Visa or Mastercard. Their ultimate sanctions include barring outlets from using Visa or Mastercard.It is amazing how bad we are at predicting the direction of interest rate rises. Back in February, when I took out my current mortgage, economists were predicting interest rate cuts this year. At that time, the best two-year fixes and discounted variable rates were identical. Happy that I could comfortably weather several base rate hikes and that rates could fall, I opted for a discounted rate. Following this month’s quarter percentage point rise in base rates, I am now kicking myself.But I am not alone. This increase wrong-footed most experts. Just before the Bank of England’s decision, 38 of 46 economists polled by Bloomberg predicted that rates would stay the same.Part of the reason is that so many global factors now influence UK inflation and therefore interest rates. In recent years, a booming China and Asia flooded the UK with cheaper goods, helping to keep inflation low. Now a booming China is pushing up commodities prices, helping to drive up UK inflation.With so many factors at play, it’s hardly surprising we are caught off-balance. If you are stretching yourself with mortgage debt, my advice is to opt for a fix.rob.budden@ft.com
551;V;Visa Inc;2006-07-28T11:03:14Z;Credit card rates;;The credit card companies have wasted no time in bumping up their interest rates following the Office of Fair Trading’s ruling that they should cut the penalties they levy for late or missed payments.One reader complains that the rate on her platinum Barclaycard will increase from 17.9 to 22.9 per cent on August 1 – an increase of no less than five percentage points.“The reason I was given was that they have reduced the [penalty] fees,” she says. “I did mention that I knew about the OFT ruling. They then came up with all sorts of excuses including ‘Barclaycard are moving on’ -– whatever that means – and ‘they are still competitive in the market place’.”When Doghouse contacted Barclaycard, it confirmed that the OFT’s action – thought likely to cost the industry £300m in profits – was one of the reasons for the increase.“While the OFT issue is an additional factor in our costs, it is not the only driver of the changes were are making,” Barclaycard says. “In line with the credit card industry we have seen our costs rise as a result of bad debt and therefore our interest rates reflect current trading conditions.”But Barclaycard is not alone in pushing up its rates at a time when the bank base rate has been stable or declining. The base rate was cut from 4.75 per cent last August and has held steady at 4.5 per cent since.A review of recent credit card rate rises carried out by Moneyfacts showed that a large number of card issuers have pushed up their rates since May 1. Mint put up the purchase rate on its Mastercard/Visa and Gold Mastercard/Visa and Platinum Mastercard from 14.9 per cent to 15.9 per cent while Marks and Spencer’s purchase rate on its &More Mastercard went up from 15.9 to 16.9 per cent.Virgin Money Mastercard’s cash rate leaped from 20.9 per cent to 24.9 per cent while American Express’s Platinum Amex purchase rate went from 8.9 to 14.9 per cent.At the same time Moneyfacts has noticed that more credit card issuers are changing their order of repayments so that the cheapest, rather than the dearest, debt is paid off first. HSBC has become the latest to do this.
552;V;Visa Inc;2006-06-29T21:03:40Z;MasterCard charged over antitrust rules;;The credit card group Master­Card has been formally charged by the European Union’s top antitrust regulator, accused of breaking its rules by restricting competition between banks.It is the latest escalation in a long-running antitrust battle between the European Commission and the credit card industry, and is the second time MasterCard has received antitrust charges from Brussels. It follows the Commission’s attack on groups such as Visa and MasterCard in April, when Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, accused them of making “outrageous” profits and operating a “closed shop”.MasterCard confirmed on Thursday that it had received a confidential “statement of objections” outlining the charges last Friday. The Commission also confirmed the charges, saying it had taken “the preliminary view that MasterCard restricts competition between member banks by pre-determining a minimum price retailers must pay for accepting MasterCard and Maestro branded payment cards”.The regulator also warned that, should it decide to rule against the group, it “could prohibit MasterCard’s interchange fees if the Commission is ultimately not convinced that possible efficiencies of MasterCard’s interchange fees sufficiently outweigh any restrictive effects on price competition be-tween merchant banks”.Interchange fees are paid between banks servicing the shops that accept credit cards and the banks servicing the cardholder. The allegedly excessive interchange rates in the MasterCard network were the subject of a 2003 statement of objections by Brussels.The crackdown on MasterCard is likely to affect millions of European consumers, since some 45 per cent of all payment cards issued in Europe carry the MasterCard or Maestro logo. The regulator has argued repeatedly that the high fees and lack of competition within card networks harm consumers because additional costs are ultimately passed on to cardholders.Should the group be found guilty, it also faces antitrust fines of up to 10 per cent of its global annual turnover. Last year MasterCard posted net revenues of $2.9bn (€2.3bn, £1.6bn).MasterCard, which used to be owned by a consortium of banks, was floated on the New York Stock Exchange last month, raising $2.4bn in its initial public offering. It is the second biggest credit card company behind Visa. Together the two groups control just under 90 per cent of the European market.MasterCard said on Thursday it would respond to the charges both in writing and at a hearing this year. It pointed out that “a Commission’s negative finding may be appealed to the European courts”. Under Ms Kroes, the Commission has made the credit card industry one of the main targets of its antitrust actions.
553;V;Visa Inc;2006-06-01T19:35:22Z;MasterCard and Visa battle for sponsorship;;MasterCard and Visa are embroiled in a battle over sponsorship rights that makes the rivalry between Argentina and Brazil seem cordial.MasterCard has been Fifa’s global partner in financial services for the past 16 years and expected to continue in that position. But in April football’s governing body replaced it with rival Visa, granting it global rights to a variety of Fifa tournaments from 2007 to 2014.MasterCard immediately cried foul, filing a lawsuit in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The harshly worded 22-page complaint accuses Fifa of “a blatant and deceitful violation of a right of first refusal granted to MasterCard”, noting the payment processor has over the years “paid tens of millions of dollars to be, and to have the option to continue being in the future, the official sponsor of World Cup soccer”.The complaint argues that MasterCard had already signed an extension and that if Fifa is not stopped from continuing in its agreement with Visa, MasterCard will “be deprived of a unique asset (Fifa World Cup sponsorship) and will suffer irreparable harm for which monetary damages, even of hundreds of millions of dollars, will not adequately compensate it”.MasterCard hopes to win the suit and force Fifa into honouring the contract it claims gave it rights to the next two World Cup tournaments. Analysts assume the 2006 tie-up has been very lucrative for MasterCard but the company declined to release any figures due to the ongoing litigation.Visa, for its part, is taking the high road. “Suffice to say we’re not going to get into any details about this until after this World Cup,” said Mike Sherman, Visa spokesman. “We don’t want to get in MasterCard’s way.”In an April 10 press release announcing the agreement, however, Visa took the chance to kick a little dirt in MasterCard’s eye. Christopher Rodrigues, president and chief executive of Visa International, said: “We will work with our extensive network of 20,000 member financial institutions to convey the zeal and excitement of football to our hundreds of millions of Visa cardholders worldwide.”What is at stake is an enormous marketing opportunity to reach fans of the world’s most popular sport. Beyond slapping logos on everything, MasterCard was also in the enviable position of being the only credit card accepted for advanced purchases this year.The company essentially had a lock on the millions of dollars in fees paid from processing the estimated 3m tickets sold at prices from €21 ($27) to €600.The winner of the MasterCard vs Visa match will not be known for some time. Regardless of the outcome, though, MasterCard will always have Berlin.
554;V;Visa Inc;2006-05-25T20:10:09Z;MasterCard IPO raises $2.4bn;;MasterCard debuted powerfully on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday - its shares soaring by more than 15 per cent - after the world’s second largest credit card issuer raised $2.4bn in an initial public offering. It was the biggest US IPO in two years.The debut helped to soothe nerves on Wall Street. MasterCard’s fortunes were in stark contrast to those of Vonage, the internet telephone company, which on Wednesday had staged the worst debut in almost two years.Vonage continued its downward trend on Thursday, with its share price approaching $13 – down from its issue price of $17.The size of the MasterCard IPO fell short of the company’s original expectations amid concerns over its mounting litigation problems.The shares were priced at $39, below the company’s previously forecast range of $40 to $43 a share. But in early first-day trading, the shares soared, reaching $44.8 shortly before midday. By late afternoon shares were up more than 16 per cent at $45.32.Securities and Exchange Commission-registered IPO volume has now reached $18.9bn in the year to date, its highest level in six years, despite the difficult market conditions.Rich Petersen, senior researcher at Thomson Financial, said: “We have a full IPO pipeline while we are by no means at the 1996 level. I’d say the market is generally looking pretty healthy.”The float transforms the 40-year-old credit card issuer from a membership association, jointly owned by banks, into a public company.MasterCard plans to use $650m of the proceeds to add to its anti-litigation war chest.The company and its larger rival, Visa, face ongoing legal battles over what are known as interchange fees, which retailers pay the associations to process credit and debit card transactions.MasterCard’s float, underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and HSBC, is the largest since the $2.9bn IPO in May 2004 of Genworth Financial, a financial services arm of General Electric, according to Dealogic.MasterCard reported net income of $126.7m in the first quarter, up nearly 36 per cent. Revenue climbed 12 per cent to $738.5m.
555;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Cash is the enemy of the card issuers;;Payment card issuers are waging war on cash by introducing contactless cards for low-value transactions.Purchases are made using a contactless card by placing it within a few centimetres of a card reader, which uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to extract data.Since a signature or personal identity number is not required for most small purchases, transactions can be carried out rapidly – without necessarily removing the card from a wallet.Consumers in the UK make about 27bn cash transactions a year, worth £250bn, and about 80 per cent of these are for purchases of less than £10, according to Visa International estimates.“Card issuers are aggressively trying to increase the size of their market, and the enemy is cash,” says Christophe Uzureau, a banking analyst at research house Gartner.“They want to replace as many cash transactions as possible with card transactions, so they can earn fees.”Contactless payment cards have already been successfully implemented in transport systems, notably the Octopus card in Hong Kong and the Oyster card in London, and both Mastercard’s PayPass and Visa’s Contactless systems have been piloted in the US.JP Morgan Chase has also issued more than 6m credit and debit cards which include contactless technology under the name “blink”.The blink system uses the existing Visa and Mastercard infrastructure to authorise payments, and at many retailers a signature is not required for transactions of less than $25. American Express has also introduced its ExpressPay contactless system on some Blue American Express cards.Although card companies are driving the adoption of contactless technology, it offers significant benefits to retailers, such as fast food outlets and convenience stores, where typical transaction values are low. These include higher transaction speeds, increased transaction values, and lower cash handling costs.“We’ve found that transactions carried out using blink are three to five seconds faster than credit card transactions, and seven to nine seconds faster than cash transactions,” says Rob Williams, controller at The Bailey Co, parent company of Arby’s, a fast food restaurant chain based in the US.He adds: “This means each Arby’s employee can get more customers through per hour, so we get higher productivity.”Mr Williams has found that customers spend about 50 per cent more when they use a contactless card than when they pay for their food with cash: “I think it is psychological: because customers are not pulling cash out of their wallet, they spend more.” Arby’s has also made productivity gains with less time being spent on counting money and taking it to the bank, Mr Williams says.Another benefit to retailers is that cards allow them to capture data about their customers from small transactions.“If contactless cards offer merchants better information on their customers, that could prove to be valuable,” says Mr Uzureau.So far, Europe has lagged behind the US in the introduction of contactless payment cards, although Royal Bank of Scotland plans to run limited trials of MasterCard’s PayPass system in the UK this summer. Visa also plans a trial of its Visa Contactless later in the year.In the US, each transaction is authorised online just like a credit or debit card transaction, but in the UK transactions under £10 will usually be “offline” – the card will interact with the card reader, but the authorisation process will be skipped – making them even faster. To provide security, shoppers must enter a Pin after a set number of offline transactions.Mr Uzureau warns that although lowering the security requirements for contactless transactions may make them faster, this risks scaring off security-conscious users. But with a Pin-free transaction limit of just £10 they are unlikely to be big targets for criminals.Debit cards accounted for more retail spending than cash last year for the first time in the UK, according to payments association Apacs.If contactless cards prove successful, paying cash may soon be a thing of the past.
556;V;Visa Inc;2006-05-03T18:37:29Z;MasterCard IPO to raise up to $5.6bn;;MasterCard, the US credit card association, is seeking a $5.6bn valuation from investors as it moves closer to ending its 40-year history as a private company through an initial public offering.In a filing with US regulators on Wednesday, MasterCard said it intended to sell up to 61.5m shares in the company at a price between $40 and $43 each. This would allow it to raise up to $2.6bn, slightly more than it originally expected, and give it a market capitalisation of about $5.6bn on its stock market debut.The IPO of MasterCard, which is expected in late May, will be closely followed by Visa, its main competitor, which has until now resisted going public.At the valuation being sought, which is equivalent to about 11 times earnings, MasterCard would still be trading at a significant discount to American Express.The increased size of the deal highlights how the market for new listings in the US is growing stronger after a choppy 2005, with brand-named companies appearing particularly attractive to investors.Vonage, the internet telephony provider, last week doubled the size of its planned listing, which now aims to raise $531m.Among the largest new issues in the pipeline is the IPO of Burger King, which is owned by private equity groups led by Texas Pacific Group.MasterCard’s IPO has been in the works for more than a year, with an initial target of raising $2.45bn.However, the timing slipped after Robert Selander, the chief executive, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.This week, the company reported that first quarter earnings rose more than 30 per cent, from $93m last year to $127m, helped by increased spending on its cards, both by consumers and businesses.Net revenues rose 12 per cent to $738.5m in the first quarter.MasterCard shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol “MA”. In Wednesday’s filing MasterCard also named six new board members, including Mark Schwartz of Soros Fund Management.One issue hanging over MasterCard as it seeks to go public is a pending class-action lawsuit that accuses it and Visa of colluding to charge merchants exceptionally high fees for use of their services.The banks that issue credit cards and own MasterCard have also been named in the suit.MasterCard’s IPO, which is being managed by investment bankers at Goldman Sachs, will rank as the largest new listing in the US since 2004, when General Electric spun off Genworth, its insurance division.Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, has said it plans to lower its ratings on MasterCard’s debt after the completion of the IPO, which would increase lending fees.
557;V;Visa Inc;2006-04-12T18:16:10Z;EU attacks credit card operators over fees;;Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, on Wednesday threatened to take antitrust action against banks and payment card companies for exploiting consumers and small businesses, singling out Visa and MasterCard.She said payment card operators were making ?outrageous? profits and accused the industry of operating ?a closed shop?.A European Commission inquiry into the payment card sector found yesterday that little cross-border competition existed between providers. Every year 23bn card payments are made in the EU worth ?1,350bn.Ms Kroes predicted that cardholders could save hundreds of euros if the market was made fully competitive.She praised Germany and the Netherlands as the countries with the lowest credit and debit card fees, while Portugal had the highest.The Commission?s investigation pointed to large discrepancies between fees charged in EU member states as evidence of the poor state of competition. It found that the fees retailers pay to credit card companies vary between countries by up to 500 per cent for Visa and by 650 per cent for MasterCard.Fees paid by consumers can be twice as high depending on where the card is issued.On average, card acceptance fees charged by banks across Europe add 2.5 per cent to every purchase, Ms Kroes said, describing the levy as a ?tax on consumption?.The current scheme was particularly hard on small and medium-sized retailers, whose fees for Visa and MasterCard transactions were up to 70 per cent higher than those raised on larger businesses.The commissioner called on the industry to come forward with plans to redress these problems during a 10-week consultation period. But should voluntary action fail to meet the Commission?s concerns, Ms Kroes said she would have no qualms about pursuing and punishing companies that break EU competition rules. Wednesday?s report detailed the interim findings of a sweeping probe launched last year into the EU?s retail financial services industry.The investigation reflects the Commission?s concern that its efforts to create a borderless, pan-European market for financial services have yet to deliver benefits to consumers and businesses.The EU competition watchdog has already conducted a series of antitrust investigations against Visa, MasterCard and other financial services groups, forcing Visa, for example, to lower its ?interchange fees? (the fees paid between banks for every transaction). Last year, the high level of fees charged by Visa and MasterCard also came under attack from Britain?s Office of Fair Trading.The Commission report said the credit card business was so lucrative that interchange fees could be abolished altogether without undermining the companies? ability to ?generate a healthy profit?.Ruth Wandh?fer, payments expert of the European Banking Federation, said banks remained committed to the introduction of the Single Euro Payment area, which is designed to make all cross-border payments in the EU as cheap as national ones by 2010.A Visa spokesman said the difference between fees charged in various EU member states reflected a range of factors.The group also warned that ?attempts by regulators in individual European countries to intervene in the setting of interchange rates run counter to the drive towards a single market for card payments?.
558;V;Visa Inc;2006-03-13T20:19:36Z;James Altucher: Card fraud needn’t be an identity crisis;;"The other day I got the call I had been most dreading. “Mr Altucher, we believe there has been unauthorised use of your credit card.” Not only that, they were calling about a Visa I had no recollection of owning and about a string of purchases made in September 2005 (although they wouldn’t tell me what those purchases were). I don’t own a Visa and I’ve only owned American Express cards. Damn! My identity had been stolen!It had never happened to me before so I started looking into it. The Federal Trade Commission received 250,000 complaints about identity theft in 2005.
At 26 per cent of all complaints, credit card fraud was the most common form of reported identity theft. Telephone or utilities fraud came in next at 18 per cent, bank fraud at 17 per cent and employment fraud at 12 per cent. Government benefits fraud at 9 per cent and loan fraud at 5 per cent were the least common.Depending on the type of theft, the average consumer will spend up to 300 hours on solving a case of identity theft. Many such thefts are not discovered until up to 18 months after the event.There are several companies offering software for credit card companies to monitor potential identity thefts. I like the sector because it is based on a problem that is not going away. Reported fraud complaints to the FTC
have risen from 542,000 in 2003 to 686,000 in 2005 and
I am sure many problems go unreported (or may not even have been discovered).The sector is largely unknown from a stock analyst perspective and many of these companies tend to be under-followed.Intersections, Inc. (Nasdaq: INTX), which I own, is my favourite in the sector. It has software to monitor for unusual activity on credit cards. It also offers identity theft insurance, fraud recovery assistance, pre-employment background screening, reference checks and drug testing. Almost all its revenues come from identity theft software and services. The company has a market cap of $170m, $51m cash in the bank and only $4m in debt. With $26m in cash flows over the past 12 months it is trading at a multiple over cash flows of only 4.6.The stock got hit recently when the group announced its relationship with American Express was to be phased out over the next few months. But American Express represents less than 10 per cent of its revenues and analysts have barely budged on their estimates for 2006 and 2007.In addition, value-centric mutual fund Heartland Value Advisors recently filed a 13G stating it owned 10 per cent of the company. Hedge fund Cannell Capital also filed a 13G saying it owned more than 5 per cent of the company.Another couple of stocks, which I do not hold, look, on the basis of a little homework, as though they could also be positioned to benefit. One is Equifax, which collects, organises and manages various types of financial, demographic and marketing information.Its Information Services division creates products that allow customers to make real-time risk and marketing decisions about consumers and commercial enterprises. More relevant to us is its Personal Solutions division, which has services offering consumers information so they can reduce exposure to identity fraud and better manage their credit health.Equifax’s ratios look good. Its enterprise value/Ebitda is 10.6, while its enterprise value over cash flow is 10.61. It has cash of $37.5m and debt of $556.1m.While the debt level is high in terms of absolute figures the debt/Ebitda ratio is only slightly above 1.The company has been increasing revenues quarter over quarter for the past four quarters and year on year for the past three years. It has also increased its cash flow over the past three quarters and the past three years.Choicepoint provides information products and services to various companies. Significant offerings include DNA identification services, background screenings and drug testing administration services, public filing searches, credential verification, authentication services, visual investigative and link analysis software, data visualisation, analytics and data integration services – this group accounts for about 15 per cent of its revenues.Choicepoint looks a little more expensive, with an EV/cash flow of 16.5. It has cash of $5.38m and debt of $84.27m. But that debt is not a problem; its debt/Ebitda is 0.26. The company has been increasing revenues quarter over quarter for the past four quarters and year on year for the past three years. It has also been cash flow positive for the past four quarters and three years.So what happened with my identity theft problem? It turns out it was an Amazon.com Visa that one James Altucher had signed up for in September, used to buy some books (including a pre-order of
my latest book SuperCash), and then promptly forgot about.Now I need to find out what stocks are good for memory enhancement so I don’t waste three hours on hold with the credit card company again."
559;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;John Kay: English triumphs everywhere but home;;"Some products are chosen not because they are the best available, but because everyone else is using them. Fashions in children’s toys and sports footwear come and go. But for some goods and services there are economic or practical advantages in co-ordinated behaviour. The widest range of movies is available for the most popular format, the best dating agency has the most potential dates.Control of networks and standards has been lucrative for companies such as Microsoft, BSkyB and Ebay.The peculiar characteristic of these markets is that quality is not the key to commercial success. Microsoft triumphed not because its operating system was outstanding but because sponsorship by IBM led to many early adoptions. The opportunity to achieve market dominance with unexceptional products is a business strategist’s dream but such opportunities are rare. Google is not the next Microsoft, or even Ebay. Its customers want the best search engine rather than the search engine with the most users. If it ceases to be good, it will be less widely used.It is hard for private companies to own standards because wide acceptance and proprietary control are in conflict. This tension explains why Sony’s Betamax lost the format war to VHS, and why Visa supplanted Amex as the leading provider of plastic money.These business lessons are key to the economics of the oldest and most important compatibility standard of all – language.Almost no one speaks Lithuanian or Tagalog because they chose it as the most mellifluous language, or the easiest to learn, or the one which gave access to the most beautiful literature. Your mother tongue is literally the tongue of your mother. You learn language to communicate first with your parents and then with your friends and neighbours.Mother tongue compatibility is, like all standards, a natural monopoly; but it is a local one. So many different standards survive, each geographically dominant; only languages spoken by too few people to meet the full range of everyday needs die out.But globalisation creates a distinct requirement for a standard of global communication. This role was once served by Latin and then by French. But few people then lived in a global world. English is the new lingua franca. Stopped in a French street by Italians asking the way I automatically gave an English response to their question in English. Later I wondered how they knew I was British. Then I realised they probably did not.So we have the paradox described in last week’s British Council report. English as a first language is in decline. Once the most widely spoken mother tongue, English may already have been overtaken by Hindi, Spanish and variants of Mandarin. But English as a second language is in irresistible ascendancy. The local monopoly becomes less significant as English-speaking regions account for a smaller proportion of population and purchasing power. The global monopoly becomes more entrenched as command of English becomes essential to commercial activity.Will global, second-language English differ from local, first-language English? And will the economic advantages enjoyed by English native speakers grow or decline? The financial services industry, the most global of all, points to the answers. Native English speakers are now less internationally useful than their bilingual French, German or Spanish colleagues, and British firms have similarly lost a source of advantage.But the language of the trading floor, peppered with specialist terms and expletives, is not the language of Jane Austen, just as the language of the Australian outback is not the language of Jane Austen. Yet if the trader or the redneck arrive in the boardroom, they speak in terms that Austen would have understood. It is not necessary to have the language skills of Joseph Conrad, Isaiah Berlin or Kazuo Ishiguro to order a meal in a restaurant, but international mergers and acquisitions are never likely to be negotiated in pidgin. The spread of English is not good news for native English speakers but can only be of benefit to the native English language.www.johnkay.com"
560;V;Visa Inc;2006-02-20T12:15:09Z;Speak up, Torinese, we can’t hear you;;The people of Turin are known for being withdrawn. I say this not because I have noticed them being anything other than the usual chatty and friendly Italians, but because other Italians say so. Even people from Turin talk garrulously and openly about how closed they are.This is perhaps the reason behind one of the biggest let-downs of the Games, the lack of unofficial acknowledgement in the host city that anything is going on.Turin is of course plastered with the official colours and symbols of the Games. Almost every main street is decorated on both sides with red flags, which are part of the range of official Olympic livery and, being Italian, are smart and understated.Olympic-themed banners have also been put to practical use, often covering up unfinished construction. Glimpses of what looks like Turin’s latest thriving export - rubble - can be spotted through gaps in the hoardings.But I am screaming out for a touch of overstatement, at least from the people of Turin.On the balconies of apartment blocks, in the windows of shops, on the citizens’ clothing, there is nothing. No signs saying that Turin welcomes the world. No special offers for visitors to the shops and restaurants of the centre, except those that are part of a Visa-sponsored programme.The official logo and marketing police stamp out any signs of unofficial Olympic advertising, but that should not stop ordinary people and businesses hanging out flags of welcome.One night last week I had trouble finding an open restaurant in the centre, let alone one saying I could have a free Games cocktail featuring spirits in the colours of the five Olympic rings. “Drink three and we throw you down the bobsleigh track!”Italians don’t go in for flag waving as much as, for example, Americans. Probably only the performances of the Italian national football team can pull everyone together. If the Olympics in their own town can’t instil an outbreak of Torinese pride, it’s hard to imagine what would.So I was heartened and surprised to find that not all heads are buried in a snowdrift. One or two people at least are alive to the possibilities.In Turin’s cathedral, a little down on the left from the entrance, is a large blown-up cardboard photograph of Pier Giorgio Frassati, “a saint on skis” as he is described in large letters. And indeed there he is, standing on the snow in Bardonecchia, where the snowboarding events of these Olympics are taking place.The cathedral, and nearby convent to which one is directed for a small exhibition about Frassati for the duration of the Games, have taken the opportunity to advertise the worthy life of someone who liked being in the mountains.It turns out that the connection to skiing is slightly opportunistic, but so what? In any case, the large picture shows a strong-looking young man, squinting a little from the sunlight and wearing some ancient-looking ski equipment. He has a number 25 on his chest and what could be a cigarette or cheroot sticking out of his mouth. The photo was taken in 1925, the year Frassati died of polio aged 24.Frassati is laid to rest in the cathedral and was beatified by the last pope. He had a short life of religious devotion, battles against fascism, helping the poor, and, apparently, practical joking and mountaineering.He once wrote to a friend: “I left my heart on the mountain peaks and I hope to retrieve it this summer when I climb Mont Blanc. If my studies permitted, I would spend whole days on the mountains admiring in that pure atmosphere the magnificence of God.”Bode Miller, the brash American who has had a very disappointing Games so far, seems equally wedded to the mountains, when compared at any rate with the medals ceremonies three hours’ away in Turin’s centre.“At least I don’t have to go all the way down to Torino tomorrow,” was his churlish response to not winning a medal last week for which he was strongly fancied. I can imagine what the skiing saint would say to that.adrian.michaels@ft.com
561;V;Visa Inc;2006-02-15T23:19:17Z;Credit card handling lapses spur regulatory effort;;Barney Frank, the senior Democrat on the house financial services committee, said on Wednesday he would consider legislation to require credit card companies to name the party responsible for consumer data breaches.Mr Frank said in a letter to the chief executives of Visa USA and Mastercard that the source of the data leak should notify customers affected, or be identified in public as being responsible.“If this can not be done legally at present, I feel make strongly enough on this point to make legislative changes to make this a requirement,” Mr Frank wrote.His letter follows Visa USA’s announcement this week that a data security breach at a US merchant may have compromised customer accounts.Visa said last week that it “was recently notified by a US merchant that it may have experienced a data security breach resulting in the compromise of Visa card account information”.The company said it had “quickly alerted the affected financial institutions to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring and, if needed, reissuing cards.”Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual have all blocked and reissued some debit cards in response to the reported breach. All have declined to identify the retailer involved or to describe the nature of the breach.Mr Frank said he had raised similar concerns in 2003, after a major breach of data security at BJ Wholesale Club, which led both credit card companies to instruct local banks and credit unions in New England to block and reissue credit cards. In that case, both Visa and Mastercard declined to identify BJ’s as the source of the leak.“The inability to identify the source of the breach created an inaccurate and unfair impression that these institutions were somehow at fault and that their card programs were not as secure or well managed as their larger bank competitors,” he said.He also argued that keeping the retailer’s identity hidden had “done more harm than good”, and led to a series of lawsuits against the retailer.“Had BJ’s followed the example of numerous other retailers, universities and banks that publicly disclosed security breaches over the past year, and then worked with all parties to mitigate potential fraud, these problems could have been minimised,” he argued.Last summer, MasterCard and Visa notified member banks of a security breach at CardSystems Solutions, a credit card processor, that may have exposed more than 40m cards of all types to fraud.The announcement marked the most serious instance to date of security lapses that have exposed customers' financial and other personal information to possible theft.
562;V;Visa Inc;2006-01-26T12:00:13Z;FBI chief urges exchange on computer fraud data;;The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert Mueller, has called for the world’s law enforcement agencies to introduce a way of quickly exchanging information in order to battle the growing problem of global computer security breaches and fraud.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Mr Mueller said there was no need to create a global agency to battle computer fraud, but added: “There can be standardised regulations and rules relating to data retention and secondly a mechanism for the swift exchange of information.”His comments come amid signs that computer security and the risk of online fraud are an increasing risk for both companies and consumers. A survey of large companies by Swiss Re shows computer-based risks as their main concern, ahead of other worries such as corporate governance and natural disasters. Meanwhile, research by Visa International, the credit card network, shows that identity theft and fraud is the main concern of consumers around the world.The issue of computer fraud has gained prominence in recent years following a series of hacking attacks on large companies and several high-profile security breaches at companies that keep sensitive customer information.Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Visa International, said the issues of fraud and identity theft had been exacerbated by the growth of electronic commerce, which means consumers have to rely on banks and retailers to keep their information safe. He said most banks have a regulatory obligation to look after data, but that these regulations do not extend to retailers and other organisations that also have access to sensitive information.The FBI has worked together with other law enforcement agencies to track down hackers who co-ordinate attacks on US companies but are based in other countries. However, Mr Mueller stressed that common regulations in areas such as data retention would make it easier for investigators to track down the perpetrators.Swiss Re, which surveyed 60 large companies, found that computer security issues were the main perceived risk among executives of large companies in the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, and ranked in the top three in France and Germany. Participants in the survey also said they felt that the risks posed by computer-related issues were increasing.“It is surprising that computer-based risk is at or near the top, for all industries and all countries,” said Christian Mumenthaler, chief risk officer at Swiss Re. “All companies are more dependent on critical infrastructure.”Mr Rodrigues said the Visa study showed the widespread nature of the problem and the sense among consumers that anybody could be affected. “Card security is about personal relevance,” he said. “Disasters such as the Tsunami are terrible, but people think it isn’t going to happen to them.”
563;V;Visa Inc;2006-01-23T18:47:24Z;Is ‘it’ the future of advertising?;;A few years ago, the argument could be made that the BBDO Worldwide advertising agency just wasn’t made for these times. It could still create flashy television commercials – it was the agency, after all, that accidentally set Michael Jackson’s hair ablaze at a shoot for Pepsi – but that began to seem rather quaint given the growing importance of other media.Today that argument does not wash. BBDO, the largest advertising agency in the world’s biggest marketing services group, Omnicom of the US, is on a roll. In the last year, it has won more than $1bn in new accounts (measured by client spending), adding such names as Ebay, Bank of America, and Motorola to a client roster that included General Electric, Pepsi and Gillette. If it had not been for the defection of Visa to another Omnicom agency, TBWA\ Worldwide, its year would have been nearly perfect.The results have raised the question of how BBDO has done it, and when Andrew Robertson, its chief executive, and David Lubars, its North American chief creative officer, give their answer, the remarkable thing is that it can be summed up in a word.It is “it”.The “it” in question is an example of what Mr Lubars calls a “reductionist nugget” – the Holy Grail of the new BBDO. By that, he means an idea so powerful, yet so adaptable, that it can be used as the basis of a marketing campaign that works in any medium – a television commercial, a website, a word-of-mouth campaign, an outdoor poster or even a package design.BBDO developed “it” in response to the creative challenge posed by one of its new clients, Ebay – the online marketplace that is itself a symbol of the “new economy”.“They are a very complicated client,” Mr Lubars says. “They don’t make or sell anything. Other people use them. They are like an enabler, a host. What they do is like air or gas.”BBDO’s campaign began with a similarly nebulous quality. For several days last autumn, BBDO promoted “it” itself. Posters of a brightly coloured “it” began to appear on city streets. A website came to life with video evidence of the global popularity of “it”. The message was emphasised in television advertisements that featured an unnamed actor stepping aside to reveal “it” – the letters “I” and “t” perched on a pedestal like a work of art in a museum.“Introducing the new It,” the actor said with all the gravitas of a supporting player in a soap opera. “With sleek design and incredible handling, it can turn on a dime. It can hold up to 2,500 of your favourite songs. It can cook anything from succulent chicken to chateaubriand. It doesn’t lose suction. It was designed by German engineers and developed in Sweden by renowned Japanese scientists. It has over 17,000 lines of resolution. It.”It was only several days later that the public was let in on the joke. “Whatever it is, you can get it on Ebay,” the advertisements said now, still treating the word “it” – rendered in the typeface of the Ebay logo – like a product itself.“We have given them a physical manifestation of the cerebral thing that they do,” Mr Lubars said. “What is ‘it’? ‘It’ is anything. Then ‘it’ became TV. ‘It’ became print. ‘It’ became online. ‘It’ became guerrilla [marketing]. ‘It’ became all these things because an idea can go anywhere.”The Ebay campaign only began running in the US at the end of last year, but officials of the online company mentioned their marketing efforts as a factor in strong fourth-quarter results, which added to the growing sense of vindication at BBDO.Only a couple of years ago, BBDO was an agency in transition, if not turmoil. Global leadership was turned over to Mr Robertson, then 43, a Zimbabwean-born one-time wunderkind of the London advertising world who had already served as chief executive of its London unit, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO as well as WCRS, another UK agency.Mr Robertson wasted no time in displaying the taste of a new generation, replacing BBDO’s long-time creative leader in New York, Ted Sann, with Mr Lubars, a BBDO veteran who had gone to rival Fallon, where he made his name by helping to create a series of internet films for BMW, the carmaker.Together, Mr Robertson, now 45, and Mr Lubars, 47, look like the stars of a production of The Odd Couple. Mr Robertson is the advertising world’s equivalent of a Brancusi sculpture – stylishly dressed in braces and bold ties, he is so polished he glows. Mr Lubars, by contrast, tends to look as if he has just rolled out of bed.But they are kindred spirits in their belief that BBDO did not need to be fixed, only redirected – an assessment shared by outside analysts such as Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch. She says creative people at agencies paid so much attention to television because they were encouraged to do so. By changing incentives, agency executives can change behaviour. “I don’t think it’s that hard to take that same creative mind and let it loose,” she says.In that sense, Mr Lubar’s “reductionist nugget” is a creative filter – a test of whether an idea is sufficiently mobile to work in different media.“The insight that forms the work, that’s a timeless thing – great insight, great work, no matter what era,” Mr Lubars says. “[Now], it’s got to have such legs that I can go more than three places. Not everything works in every medium, so that’s hard to do.”One consequence of this focus is that advertising may become more visual. The “it” of the Ebay campaign works both as language and as a sculptural element. “It is a much more visual medium,” Mr Lubars says.Mr Robertson argues that BBDO’s emphasis on cross-media ideas has become common across the creative industries. He says he saw a similar dynamic taking shape during a recent visit to Electronic Arts, the video game-maker based in Redwood City, California.“Guys who are into sounds now – guys who want to make music – aren’t going into the record business,” he says. “All the kids that when we were growing up would have formed bands are now creating soundtracks for video games. The forms are changing. There are many, many more forms.”Mr Lubars says BBDO is working on ways to turn its advertising ideas into entertainment concepts – maybe even situation comedies – and Mr Robertson looks forward to the day when consumers will not just tolerate advertising but pay for it, which sounds implausible until you think about how many people buy T-shirts with corporate logos.“Content can earn time with consumers that you cannot buy – can earn engagement with consumers that you cannot buy,” he says. “You can use that time to change what people do. You can use that time to change people’s behaviour. But it’s got to be really good.”That is wishful thinking, of course. But it may also be one of the big reasons that BBDO has been doing so well in recent months. It is run by real advertising people. Their glass is always half full – and it always tastes better than Coke. Blind taste tests prove it, you know.WHEN THE TV GETS A MIXED RECEPTIONAndrew Robertson, chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, is well suited for life today as the leader of an advertising agency. He thinks I Love Lucy is boring, writes Gary Silverman.Traditionally, advertisers and their agencies liked television shows such as I Love Lucy because they gathered large audiences. At one point, Mr Robertson says, I Love Lucy was watched by 52 per cent of US households.But there was always a flaw in this marketing model. A household television set may have been tuned to a particular programme but this did not mean that everyone in the room was enjoying the show – or even paying attention. Not all people watching Lucy loved her – and that probably made them a less receptive audience for advertisers.“If you happen to watch television late at night you will realise that actually I Love Lucy was pretty boring,” Mr Robertson says. “She had her moments, but it wasn’t worth 52 per cent of the households.”To Mr Robertson, the fragmentation of network television audiences – a product of the rise of the internet and other media – represents an opportunity for advertisers to reach more consumers on their own terms.“What has happened is that technology has made it easier for people to do what they want to do,” he says. “You can look at that as a huge threat or as an opportunity. The threat is you don’t get anything by right. You don’t get consumer engagement just because people are available to you.”The opportunity is to create advertising content that is interesting enough to attract its own audiences. It is a tall order – as anyone who ever watched the title character in I Love Lucy try to break into show business knows. Pleasing the public is tough.“You only get consumer engagement by earning it,” Mr Robertson says. “It’s not about better ads in the break. It’s not about having the best soft-drink commercial in the category. It’s about: I want to engage with you now, for a few seconds, a minute, or hours ideally, and you have the option of going to a million other places by touching a button. If I can create something that is compelling enough, you are going to stay with me. If I can’t, you’re gone.”LUCKY STRIKE OPENS P&G’S DOORThe BBDO Worldwide advertising agency is not only good. It is also lucky.Procter & Gamble’s $57bn acquisition of Gillette last year represented a stroke of good fortune for BBDO, the largest advertising-agency network in the world’s biggest marketing services group, Omnicom of the US.BBDO has produced Gillette’s advertising for decades, but neither it nor any of the other creative advertising agencies owned by Omnicom worked for P&G.That matters because of P&G’s unique position in marketing services. Agencies are keen to work with P&G because it is not only the world’s biggest advertiser, it is the most sophisticated. Working for P&G is a learning experience like no other.By virtue of the Gillette deal, BBDO became a “P&G agency” at an opportune time. Jim Stengel, P&G’s global marketing officer, has been expanding its roster of agencies – for instance, by shifting its Eukanuba pet food brand from the Saatchi & Saatchi unit of Publicis of France to Wieden + Kennedy, the agency behind Nike’s “just do it“ campaign.Mr Stengel also sounds impressed with Omnicom and BBDO. Indeed, at the Association of National Advertisers convention in Phoenix, Arizona, last October, he could be seen locked in friendly conversation with Andrew Robertson, BBDO chief executive.“Bringing Omnicom and [Omnicom chief executive] John Wren and Andrew and [David] Lubars [BBDO chief creative officer in North America] and all[in] is going to make us a better company,” Mr Stengel said.The links between P&G and BBDO have prompted chortling at Omnicom. After all, P&G bought Gillette just weeks after Omnicom’s leading rival, WPP of the UK, paid more than $1.5bn in cash and shares for Grey Global, gaining its first P&G advertising agency in the process. Omnicom pulled off the same trick without doing a thing.

Wall Street analysts had been expecting earnings of 4 cents per share.Circuit City’s total sales rose 15 per cent to $2.91bn, supported by strong sales of flat-panel TVs, portable digital audio products, notebook computers and digital photography products.However, its gross profit margin slipped from 25.2 to 24.2 per cent, reflecting price cuts for TVs and video software and its promotional low-interest financing offers.Comparable store sales rose 13.1 per cent, although the number of customers entering its stores was were largely unchanged. The company attributed the increased sales to customers buying more expensive items such as the new generation of flat-screen TVs, and to more effective merchandising in the stores.For the whole year, Circuit City said it now expected total sales growth of 8-10 per cent, up from a previous forecast expectation of 5-8 per cent.The company said also announced that Phil Schoonover, its president, would take over as chief executive from Alan McCullough when he retires at the end of February. Mr Schoonover, 45, joined Circuit City from Best Buy in October 2004.Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, saw its shares fall more than 11 per cent on Tuesday after it announced disappointing profits and a weak outlook for the fourth quarter due to higher operating costs.Circuit City’s shares rose more than 4 per cent in New York morning trading yesterday to $22.18.
565;V;Visa Inc;2005-12-15T18:50:19Z;Mobile phone that puts cash out of business;;"The bustling university town of Caen, in Normandy, was founded by William the Conqueror. It is now laying the foundations for a new technology with equally ambitious dreams of conquest – near-field communication, or NFC, writes Ben King.The NFC Forum, an industry body founded to promote the technology, hopes to turn mobile phones into versatile electronic wallets that can be used in place of cash for small purchases, or paper tickets for buses and trains.The forum has more than 60 members, including payment card businesses such as Visa, Mastercard and American Express; and phone makers such as Sony Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola and Samsung, which made the phones used in the Caen trial.NFC is a very short-range wireless technology with ­relatively low bandwidth, slightly slower than most broadband internet connections. The unique feature is that it is triggered by proximity. When two NFC devices come within a centimetre or two of each other, they automatically set up a wireless connection.It is a deceptively simple concept, which can be put to a surprisingly wide range of uses. Since October, many of these applications have been on trial in Caen.In the Monoprix supermarket, for example, one of the checkouts has an attachment with a grey NFC panel. Instead of fumbling around with a credit card or cash, a customer can just hold an NFC phone against the grey panel – and in less than a second, the payment is cleared. Sign a receipt, and the transaction is complete.Across town at the Vinci underground car park, an-other part of the NFC trial is under way. Car park users hold their NFC phones against the reader at the gates and the system identifies them, confirms that they have paid and lets them in or out. This has proved the most useful application, says Thierry Morel, the project manager at France Telecom who is overseeing the trial.Bus shelters in the town have a 2in NFC panel on them. Hold a phone against one of these panels for a few seconds and it will download an up-to-date bus timetable. The panels don’t need batteries, as the phone can
give them enough power to transmit the data through a process called electro­magnetic induction.The same, inexpensive panels have been used to turn a series of information points around the town, known as the William the Conqueror trail, into mobile information points. Hold the phone against one and it prompts the phone to play a video or dial a phone line with information about the nearby attractions.The Caen project affects just 200 trialists. But similar projects around the world are already attracting millions of users. Contactless ticketing systems for public transport, such as London’s Oyster, Hong Kong’s Octopus and Suica in Japan, are highly successful.These systems replace slow, fiddly paper tickets with a simple plastic smart card, which can be read in less than a second when held against a flat electronic reader. Travellers benefit from faster journeys and less fumbling for cash, while transport operators benefit from a quicker flow of passengers, reduced cash handling costs and less fraud.These schemes are being expanded so that travel cards can be used to make small payments in shops and be integrated into mobile phones. In Hong Kong, 50,000 Octopus phones, which can store travel cards and pay for purchases in shops, have already been sold.To date these schemes and others like them around the world have been based on two separate contactless technologies: Philips’ Mifare and Sony’s Felica. Recently, though, the companies decided to look at ways to unify the two competing standards.“We gave a presentation about how great our technology is; they presented about how great they are, then we said, ‘OK, how do we work together?’,” says Sour Chhor, general manager at Philips.The result is NFC – an attempt to create a universal standard that would help these contactless technologies reach hundreds of millions of new users. It uses the same radio frequency range as Sony and Philips’ technologies, 13.56 MHz.This means that a phone equipped with NFC can take the place of a Mifare or Felica-based transport card, without the expensive process of replacing the readers.Sony and Philips have recruited an impressive range of technology and payment companies to the project.Support from mobile operators is less unanimous, though some have signed up, including Vodafone and France Telecom, parent company of Orange.With this industry muscle behind it, it seems certain that NFC-enabled phones will appear in shops, though not until the end of 2006, according to Nicolas Faesch, director of marketing development at Orange France.To equip a phone with NFC would cost less than $5 (£3), so it could be introduced into even the cheapest handsets. Mr Faesch estimates that more than half of all mobile subscribers in France could have NFC+ phones within two years of introduction.Simply adding NFC chips to phones makes many things possible. At the moment, pairing two phones together to exchange music, contact details or other data requires a long and complex process of menus and dialogue boxes to make sure they are talking to the right device and not a stranger’s phone in a neighbouring room.With NFC, phones could just be held against each other for a second or two – a far simpler and more intuitive way of pairing devices.However, the more exciting and ambitious projects that NFC hopes to enable will require a large infrastructure to be built up at the same time.Ticketing applications will be relatively simple to build, as they need only the co-operation of the ticket issuer to make them possible.Electronic payment would be the most exciting application, in terms of its impact both on people’s lives and businesses’ costs and profits.In the US, contactless payment cards such as Mastercard’s PayPass have provided million dollar savings for merchants such as drive-through burger chains and gas stations simply by speeding each purchase up by a couple of seconds.However, mobile contactless payment would also be the most complex application to deliver. It will require mobile operators, equipment makers, banks, consumers and the merchants who will accept the payments to make a joint leap of faith and invest in NFC.Philips’ Mr Chhor points to surveys by Visa and Mastercard in the US, which found that 72 per cent of respondents felt that payment combined in a mobile phone was a “very good idea”, and 65 per cent would “use it at once” if it were commercially available.However, the record of attempts to replace small cash transactions with an electronic substitute is not promising. Early mobile
payment ventures have been too complex to be adopted widely. Projects such as Mondex, a card launched by British Telecommunications and a consortium of banks that could be loaded with cash, never persuaded enough customers or merchants that the effort was worthwhile.NFC may have a fighting chance where others have failed because so many parts of the puzzle are already in place. Contactless payment systems are springing up around the world, and if consumers become comfortable with using NFC phones for other services, it will be easier to interest them in payment. But it would take an impressive degree of co-operation between different industry players to pull it off. NFC may have a short range, but it has a very long way to travel.ADVANTAGES OF NFCNear-field communication (NFC) is a simple, short-range wireless technology. Its many uses and advantages include:■To replace slow, fiddly paper tickets for public transport.■For quick, easy payment at supermarket checkouts.■It will result in big savings for merchants such as drive-through fast-food outlets and petrol stations simply by speeding each purchase up by a couple of seconds.■Panels holding information, such as bus timetables and details about nearby attractions, do not require batteries as the phone can give them enough power to transmit their data.■To equip a phone with NFC would cost less than $5.■An impressive range of technology and payment companies have already been recruited to the project."
566;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Migrants face long wait for green card;;Scientists, engineers and other skilled professionals seeking emigration to the US could face waits of a decade or more before receiving the coveted “green card” that allows them to remain permanently in the country.This month the annual quota even to apply for employment-based green cards was exhausted for highly skilled professionals from China and India, and for less-skilled workers from all other countries, according to the State Department. The wait to apply for a green card has now grown to more than five years in many cases.The exhaustion of the annual green-card quota is the latest headache facing US companies trying to recruit scarce talent from abroad.Visa restrictions imposed after the September 11 attacks had already made it much more difficult for students and researchers to enter the US. And in 2003 Congress allowed the annual quota of temporary H-1B visas for skilled workers to drop from 195,000 to 65,000.“This is the first time we've seen this sort of retrogression in many years,” said Angelo Paparelli, managing partner of California-based Paparelli & Partners and the current president of the Academy of Business Immigration Lawyers.Mr Paparelli said the problem “could last for years” unless Congress increased the quota of employment-based green cards.Compete America, a business coalition that includes large US technology companies such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard, warned members of Congress in a letter last week that the new restrictions “will make it nearly impossible for these highly educated and skilled workers to gain permanent residence in the US in the foreseeable future”.A study released last month by the Pew Hispanic Center shows that legal immigration to the US has fallen 24 per cent since hitting a peak in 2000.
567;V;Visa Inc;2005-09-16T16:10:35Z;Now you can say that you’re loaded;;"Britons have a long-established love affair with plastic. This is reflected in the fact that over the past decade, the value of transactions made on debit and credit cards has more than doubled, according to Datamonitor, the market research group.But while our growing dependence on plastic may make us card savvy, many of us are unlikely to recognise one of the world’s fastest-growing cards if it were put into our wallets.Pre-paid cards, which are like bank accounts but are sold and reloaded like mobile phone top-up cards, are little known in the UK. In the US and Europe though, where they were launched a decade ago, they are a multi-billion dollar business.Consumers can buy the cards at local shops without a credit check, put their wages into them and make ATM withdrawals or online and telephone transactions. However the accounts have no overdraft, credit or cheque facilities.Sales of the cards in the US have tripled since their launch to $3.1bn in 2004, largely on the back of demand from immigrants and those with poor credit histories who find it hard to open a traditional bank account. Revenues are expected to soar to more than $50bn by 2008, according to the Nilson Report, the US industry analyst.Visa and American Express have been testing the market in the UK with electronic versions of paper gift vouchers and travellers’ cheques, such as Visa’s Travelex. However, the UK’s first general purpose pre-paid card is being launched in the UK. It can be used in the UK and abroad, in places you would currently use a debit or credit card.Rich Wagner, chief executive of Advanced Payment Solutions, which is launching the cashPlus card with MasterCard, says the success of mobile phone pre-pays in the UK is a good indicator of the appetite for the products in the UK. APS will be targeting the estimated 2.4m people in the UK who don’t have a bank account. “A lot of the unbanked are excluded from making purchases online; this will open up a whole new market for them,” says Wagner.The card is currently available from small retailers targeting the immigrant community. But soon cardholders able to top up their cards at more than 14,000 branches of the Post Office across the country.It’s likely that rival issuers won’t be too far behind: Visa is in talks to extend the Gift card which it co-launched with MBNA, the US bank, at the Trafford Centre in Manchester.Hugo Bottelier, vice-president of initiatives and partnerships for Visa Europe, says the real growth area for pre-paid cards is in the youth market, where parents buy the cards for their children as a safer alternative to giving them cash.Bottelier says there is also huge potential for the card in other areas, such as wage payments. “The cards may appeal to seasonal employees who don’t have an established banking relationship in the country,” he says.While the card companies have high hopes of replicating the US success of pre-paids in the UK, the launch comes against the backdrop of probes which have shed an unsavoury light on the card payment industry.Last week, the Office of Fair Trading ruled that the fees charged by MasterCard UK and the banks issuing its credit cards to process payments were “unduly high” and represented a “tax on consumers”.This week, the Competition Commission lambasted store card providers for charging retail customers up to 20 per cent more in annual interest rates than was warranted.Now the fees attached to the pre-paid cards are courting controversy with the National Consumer Council (NCC), saying they are loaded against the poor, the very target entry market for MasterCard.MasterCard’s pre-paid card will cost £9.95. Top-ups are free, but you will pay £1 per transaction and £2 to withdraw your cash at an ATM in the UK, or £3 abroad. The fees on purchases can be avoided if you pay a monthly account fee of £4.95.“These cards will push a lot of buttons for consumers because they offer facilities such as buying online and over the phone,” says Claire Whyley, deputy director of policy with the NCC. “But I am worried about the charges, particularly as the companies are not taking any risk as they are not lending money. Consumers are spending their own money. I want to see how these costs are justified.”Others say the cards may have niche appeal as a gift card, but doubt whether they would become mainstream, given the hostility to account fees in the UK.“In the US and Europe you have to pay for most parts of your bank account already including making withdrawals from cash machines other than your own bank,” says Sandra Quinn of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. “But the UK is a very competitive market. Nobody wants to pay for their banking here.”The NCC urges consumers to take a cautious approach to pre-paid cards, saying they are not a replacement for basic bank accounts.However, APS defends the cards, saying that basic bank accounts are not always the best option for those on low incomes. “We’ve found that that people who use these cards don’t like surprise fees, such as unauthorised borrowing or overdrafts,” says Wagner. “With a prepaid fee you know what your charges are as they are upfront.”"

The IPO would value the company at about $5bn and the group will list under the symbol “MA”. Goldman Sachs has been hired to handle the offering.The listing initial public offering of the company, which is owned by 1,400 financial institutions, would give outside investors 49 per cent of its equity and 83 per cent of its voting rights. It would have a new board with a majority of independent directors. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it said the move would give it a “more stable base” to implement its strategy and would address “perceived conflicts of interest”.“We believe regulators and others will recognise these changes and the increased openness they bring to our governance and ownership.”MasterCard and rival Visa have come under pressure from regulators and retailers over “interchange” fees that bank members impose on merchants for processing card transactions.In June, MasterCard and Visa and some of their biggest member banks were hit by a class-action suit filed by US retailers claiming the fees were too high.Two years ago they reached a $3bn (Pounds 1.68bn) settlement over a lawsuit brought by US merchants who said charging higher fees to process debit cards was unfair.Visa, which has a complex half-mutual, half-corporate structure, also faces pressure to go public, according to analysts.On Thursday, a Visa spokesman said “Visa is always thinking about the range of choices we might make in our business and organization that would allow us to continue to deliver maximum value to our stakeholders.”MasterCard said it would pass on some of the proceeds of the IPO to bank members but would retain $650m partly to cover potential legal costs. “Along with the proposed structural changes we believe these resources will place us in a position to defend our interests in the legal and regulatory arena.”MasterCard, founded in 1966, paved the way for the move by converting from a membership association to a private share corporation in 2002, when it started to file accounts.The second-biggest card payment association plans to sell up to $2.45bn in stock or 61.5m shares to become an independent company in an attempt to distance its bank owners from regulatory and legal threats.

It will have a new board with a majority of independent directors.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, MasterCard said the move would give it a “more stable base” to implement its strategy and would address “perceived conflicts of interest”.“We believe regulators, and others, will recognise these changes and the increased openness they bring to our governance and ownership.”MasterCard and larger rival Visa have come under increasing pressure from regulators and retailers over the “interchange” fees that bank members impose on merchants for processing card transactions.In June, MasterCard and Visa, along with some of their biggest member banks, were hit by a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of US retailers claiming the fees were too high.Two years ago, they reached a $3bn a settlement over a lawsuit brought by US merchants who argued that charging higher fees to process debit cards was unfair.Michael Lafferty, chairman of card consultants Lafferty Group, said MasterCard’s moves were intended to protect its members from further anti-trust lawsuits on matters such as alleged collusion on interchange fees.“European banks in particular are very worried about their exposure to damages from class-action lawsuits in the US.”He added that Visa, which has a complex half-mutual, half-corporate structure, was also facing pressure to go public.Industry observers believe that as independent companies, MasterCard and Visa would themselves face less regulatory and legal pressure.MasterCard said it would pass on some of the proceeds of the IPO to bank members but would retain $650m partly to cover potential legal costs. “Along with the proposed structural changes, we believe these resources will place us in a position to defend our interests in the legal and regulatory arena.”Founded in 1966, MasterCard paved the way for the move by converting from a membership association to a private share corporation in 2002 when it started to file accounts.In the first half of this year it recorded a 54 per cent increase in net income to $214m on revenues up 15 per cent at $1.43bn.Under the proposals, MasterCard would issue shares of voting Class A common stock to public investors through an IPO. A further 10 per cent of the equity would be held by a charitable foundation.
570;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;HSBC buys US credit card issuer for $1.6bn;;HSBC, the world’s third-largest bank by market capitalisation, has taken another step towards expanding its credit card portfolio in the US with the acquisition of Metris, an issuer of sub-prime credit cards, for $1.59bn in cash.The deal is the latest in a string of bolt-on acquisitions in North America which HSBC has carried out since it bought Household, the consumer finance group, in 2003.Metris is the 11th-largest issuer of Mastercard and Visa credit cards in the US, with receivables of $5.9bn. Using direct mail and other partnerships, the company offers credit cards to consumers who have been rejected by other lenders.The business will be integrated into Household, now renamed HSBC Finance Corporation, which is the 6th-largest credit card issuer in the US.Bobby Mehta, chairman and chief executive of HSBC Finance Corporation said: “This acquisition deepens our capabilities to serve the full spectrum of credit card customers.”In the past few months, HSBC has acquired the store card portfolios of Neiman Marcus and Bon-Ton, the retailers, as it expands its credit card operations in North America.Metris is one of a handful of medium-size independent credit card issuers in the US that have come under increasing pressure to seek deals in the wake of two large mergers in the sector, Bank of Americas purchase of MBNA and Washington Mutual’s acquisition of Providian Financial.In 2004, after two consecutive years of losses, the company made a profit of $33.75m on sales of $530.1m. The deal will result in a windfall for Thomas H Lee Partners, the Boston-based private equity group that owns Metris preferred stock.HSBC will pay $15 a share in cash for Metris, provided the deal closes before December 9th. Thomas H Lee, the private equity group which is Metris’s controlling shareholder, will receive $683m.
571;V;Visa Inc;2005-07-12T19:54:45Z;Touch and go at some US supermarkets;;Shoppers at Piggly Wiggly supermarkets in South Carolina can afford to forget their cash, credit cards and cheque books this summer. All they need is a finger.The regional chain, whose slogans include “Shop the Pig”, in June became the first US retailer to roll out a new biometric payment system at all its 120 stores, introducing its customers to a technology more often associated with security gates than check-outs.To pay, a customer places an index finger on a small screen, types in a number on an adjacent pad, selects an account from an “electronic wallet” and walks away.“They don't have to pay with plastic for any kind of payment …plus the transaction for them is very easy,” says Rich Farrell, who oversaw Piggly Wiggly's introduction of the system.The payment system, produced by Pay By Touch, a San Francisco technology company, is also being tested by Albertson's, the second-biggest US supermarket, as well as a number of smaller regional retailers.In the UK, the Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Co-op, a pioneer of self check-out in the UK, will launch a pilot this autumn. Similar systems are also being tested in Germany.If the technology catches on, users will only need to register once before using the same electronic wallet to shop at any retailer offering the system.Since it was set up in 2003, Pay By Touch has attracted an experienced management team including John Morris, its president, who previously headed IBM's $5bn Americas' retail industry operation.Mr Morris says: “We're clearly not a start-up we're a much more mature company. We've raised almost $100m so far, we have a very seasoned management team and we are working with a very important and powerful group of retailers.”Pay By Touch, he says, will raise an additional $50-$70m in the next few months, which will give it the capital it needs to break even. An initial public offering is possible next year.But the system faces powerful competition. Visa, Mastercard and American Express are all pursuing technology shifts of their own with the launch of “contactless” credit cards. Customers pay by passing the card, fitted with a radio frequency chip, over a reader. No signature or number is required for small payments.Both the contactless and Pay by Touch systems speed up transactions, potentially reducing queues and increasing sales at high-volume outlets such as fast-food restaurants.Contactless cards are also more secure than existing US credit and debit cards, which rely on old-style and easily copied magnetic strip cards, rather than the silicon chip “smart card” technology used in Europe and Asia.Richard Reese, who oversees technology developments at Discover Card, the smallest of the “big four” card issuers, says contactless and biometric payment systems are likely to develop together. “We don't believe there's going to be any single solution that will win out over the others,” he adds.But for US retailers, Pay by Touch offers a distinct attraction. It allows customers to pay directly from their own bank accounts, without using a bank-issued debit card. That reduces controversial network handling charges, known as interchange fees. These are currently the subject of an antitrust lawsuit brought by small retailers against Visa, MasterCard and leading banks.“A debit card transaction is in the range of around 30 cents. Pay By Touch is in the low teens. It's a very, very low-cost transaction,” says Piggly Wiggly's Mr Farrell.He also hopes the system, costing about $200 per unit, will reduce the number of customers using cash or cheques, which still carry about 45 per cent of US consumer spending. In an initial test in largely suburban neighbourhoods, about 15 per cent of Piggly Wiggly customers registered with Pay By Touch. However it may be harder to win over rural customers, who traditionally prefer cash.“There are some people that will not use it because they look it as a Big Brother kind of thing. Others just don't have time to register,” says Mr Farrell.Pay By Touch's John Morris says sceptical customers can sometimes be won over by explanation of the technology. The system, for instance, does not store information that can be used to generate a fingerprint, but an encrypted series of numbers identifying a combination of 40 data elements for each individual.Mr Morris is also convinced that people like the added security. It is, after all, “very hard to steal someone's finger”.
572;V;Visa Inc;2005-06-30T17:10:17Z;New high roller in US cards game;;Move over Citigroup and JPMorgan. The $35bn combination of Bank of America and MBNA will create a force to be reckoned with.BofA, the largest retail banking network in the US, seems an ideal fit for the biggest independent issuer of credit cards in the country.MBNA has links to organisations ranging from Harvard University to Manchester United football club. In all, MBNA claims relationships with more than 5,000 endorsing organisations that boast 160m members.By getting access to MBNA's more than 20m customers, BofA which will rebrand the MBNA name under its own will double its credit card accounts to 40m. The deal also offers BofA the chance to take advantage of MBNA's marketing expertise.MBNA grew by carving out a niche as an issuer of “affinity cards” credit cards marketed under names ranging from the American Trial Lawyers Association to the American Medical Association.David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a credit card industry newsletter, says: “First and foremost what you have is Bank of America returning to the dominant position in the credit card industry. Bank of America's retail branch network and MBNA's affinity card network are the most powerful distribution channels you can have in the consolidating credit card market.”For MBNA, another appeal of the marriage was the opportunity to take advantage of BofA's part ownership in China Construction Bank.This month, BofA paid $3bn to acquire a 9 per cent share in the Chinese bank, marking the largest single foreign investment in a mainland company. The CCB deal allows BofA to distribute credit cards in China, a market previously off-limits to MBNA.“We had been interested in that market, but we never had a way to access it,” Bruce Hammond, chief executive of MBNA, who will become president of BofA card services, said.In recent months, there has been a rash of consolidation in the credit card industry. Banks are scooping up credit card businesses as they try to diversify and look for ways to cross-sell products.This month, Washington Mutual, a Seattle-based savings bank, announced it would buy Providian Financial for $6.45bn in cash and stock, marking its first foray into the credit card business. Citigroup recently agreed to pay $760m for the private label card portfolios of two large US department stores Federated and May's.The biggest independent issuer of credit cards in the US, MBNA was once a favourite pick for Wall Street analysts. But in recent months, it has fallen on hard times.The credit card market has become competitive as issuers battle to increase their market share by undercutting each other's prices. In addition, many customers are taking out alternative loans instead of carrying balances on credit cards with high fees.“It is a difficult environment,” Mr Hammond said in April after the company reported a 94 per cent plunge in first-quarter profits.With MBNA one of the most important member banks in MasterCard's network, the world's second-largest credit card association stands to lose out the most from the merger.BofA belongs to Visa's network of banks and MBNA is likely to hand over most of its business to Visa when it hands over control to BofA.“MasterCard just lost a board member bank to Visa. That's not good,” Mr Robertson says.Uncertainty also hangs over MBNA's deal with American Express. Last year, after winning a court battle allowing it to issue branded cards through other banks, American Express signed up MBNA as its first partner in the US.
573;V;Visa Inc;2005-04-22T16:14:21Z;Drawing a big blueprint for small change;;It’s another Monday morning. Late for work and desperate for caffeine, you trudge to the deli and end up fourth in the queue.The woman at the head of the line is painstakingly counting out her pennies to make the exact payment. “I just know I have it,” she says over the din of the coffee bean grinder. The man after her insists on using his credit card to buy a £2 croissant. And the girl just in front of you fumbles with her purse and loudly wonders if she can get cash back with her bacon sarnie. You glance at the time and groan.Now imagine a world where none of these aggravations exist: no groping for your wallet, no bothering with money back or small change. Imagine a world in whichpaying for a latte and a newspaper take a fifth of a second. Imagine a world without cash.Sound intriguing? The fantasy may not be too far off if Transport for London is successful with its plans to expand the scope of the Oyster smartcard – already used by 2.5m commuters – to pay for small purchases at newsagents, pubs, coffee houses and sandwich shops.“In the 18 months since we’ve introduced the Oyster card, we’ve managed to establish public trust and confidence,” says Jay Walder, managing director for TfL. “We’ve ingrained smartcard infrastructure and habits – people in London are already accustomed to the notion of top-up and pay. So, why stop there?”Why indeed. According to the Association of Payment and Clearing Services, cash is still very much king in this country. Cash spend in the UK totals £266bn a year with £43bn spent in London alone. The average Londoner doles out £16 in cash a day – and two-thirds of these transactions involve purchases are for less than a fiver. An everyday card – that can be used in place of cash and where the value of purchases is automatically deducted – is a natural next step, says TfL.“The key to challenging the ubiquity of cash is to find something that people will always have on them, and that gives them the same flexibility as cash,” says Robert Courtneidge, a partner at the law firm Osborne Clarke who has worked in the cards and payments systems arena for overmore than 10 years. “Oyster fits in with that ambit – people have gotten used to carrying them and using them. It makes sense to expand it.”Moreover, says Walder, the advantages of Oyster – a solid reputation, lower cash-handling costs and quicker turnround time at the till – more than make up for the commission, which will probably be less than three3 per cent, Oyster would collect from retailers who sign up to the system.Already several high street banks and credit card companies, including Alliance Leicester, Barclays, HSBC, Visa and American Express have expressed interest in partnering with Oyster, as have other businesses fromincluding Marks Spencer, the retailer, to Ericsson, the mobile phone group, and Starbucks, the coffee vendor.TfL says it hopes to begin testing a new system at the end of the year and start full delivery in January 2006 – potentially expanding to other cities in the UK within the next few years.All over the globe, smartcards, or stored-value cards, are growing in popularity – particularly in Asia In 2002 , for example, Singapore launched its EZ-link card for public transport. It now has 6m cards in circulation and is which are accepted at various retailers from McDonald’s to 7-Eleven to film theatres cinemas and hair salons. In Japan, there are now more than 10m Suica cards – which were launched in 2001 – and they are accepted at stationconvenience stores and shops throughout Tokyo.Perhaps the most successful and widely accepted form of electronic currency is Hong Kong’s Octopus card. Octopus, a joint venture between the territory’s main public transportation operators, was launched in 1997 as a transport payment system. It is now accepted at more than 300 merchants and thousands of locations across Hong Kong, including parking meters, fast-food outlets, municipal swimming pools and horseracing tracks.Octopus, which TfL says is the model for how it plans to expand Oyster’s capabilities, in the micro-payment market, behaves like a pre-paid top-up card. Funds are subtracted when the card is held over a reading device , which is a low-range radio transmitter that can be built into doors, turnstiles and countertops. Money can be added to the cards at machines in underground stations, convenience stores and via an automatic draw from a bank account.The card’s usefulness lies in its capacity to process low-value purchases: where it is not worth the hassle of using a full-fledged credit card. The current average retail transaction using Octopus is HK$6.50 (43p).“These contactless systems are taking off all over the world and Octopus has helped blaze the trail,” says Chris Corum, executive editor of ContactlessNews.com, a US-based publication that tracks applications of smartcard technology. “The fact that they are “tap and go” – meaning that you need only to wave your card over a reading device – offers a level of neatness to the consumer and an element of convenience to the merchant because they can move more people through the queue more quickly.”But the big unansweredquestion is will it work here? Ivan Remsick, a senior financial services analyst at Forrester research, says the answer is not yet clear: “Oyster is a good product and it makes our lives easier – however it’s quite incompatible with current card payment systems like Visa and MasterCard, and [for it to work] it will have to be modified.”For instance, he says: “Oyster cards are transferable – meaning that you can loan them to your friends, but bank cards are certainly not. Also, if you lose your Oyster card, you can get a refund – which is a nice feature for transport but it doesn’t work for e-purse schemes in the financial services world,” he says.This is also not the first UK time that Britain has experimented with an e-cash system. In 1993, a consortium of banks and BT, the telecommunications group, launched the Mondex, card, a plastic card which contained a computer chip loaded with cash from a bank account that enabled customers to make purchases in vending machines, via pay telephones and over the internet. It first was introduced in Swindon and then at university campuses in Exeter, Edinburgh and Nottingham. But in spite of trials in about 20 countries, Mondex, which was eventually taken over by Mastercard, hardly got beyond the test stage.“Money is a difficult thing to compete with and in the fundamental sense, we were too early,” says Tim Jones, the inventor of Mondex.Jones says that ultimately the card failed because it was too foreign a concept to users who weren’t accustomed to having to carry around a separate payment card for certain purchases. “It was far too much change put in front of consumers in one go – we should have presented something that was more incremental. Oyster is in a much better place,” he says. “You’ve already got almost 3m people using the card and you don’t have to persuade them of anything.”Today Jones is a consultant to Simpay, a mobile platform from Vodafone, Orange, T-Mobile and Telefónica Móviles that allow users to pay for ringtones, music downloads and other digital content with their mobile phones.Jones believes that , similar to smartcards, mobile phone payments could become a significant competitor for smaller transactions – particularly given their huge popularity in the youth market. He points to the success in Japan of a mobile phone-based payment system from NTT DoCoMo, Japan’s dominant mobile operator.This week DoCoMo said it was in talks with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and JCB, the country’s biggest credit card providers, about investing in their credit card businesses in a step forward for its vision of towards integrating mobile communications with financial services. “It’s not completely comprehensive, but what DoCoMo is doing is clearly wonderful,” he says.Still, Jones dismisses the notion that there will ever be a single replacement for cash. Rather, he says, there will be a range of differentsources of money and that will be appropriate for different contexts. “Mobile phones, Oyster cards, debit cards – these are all nibbling away at cash,” he says. “But a cashless world? We are at least 20 to 30 years away.”
574;V;Visa Inc;2005-04-14T18:29:24Z;Angry retailers count cost of net fraud;;Internet retailers, who carry the main liability for losses from online fraud, are becoming increasingly concerned about their exposure to web-based crime.For the most part, consumers suffer little financial loss from internet fraud. If a consumer's credit card is used fraudulently over the internet, he or she need only inform the bank and the money is refunded. The bank then reclaims the money from the retailer with which the fraudulent transaction was made a process known as chargeback. Retailers, however, resent having to absorb these losses. In one case, Easy Computers, a Huddersfield-based retailer of computer equipment, has taken legal action against HSBC, its bank, over a series of fraud-related chargebacks.The online computer sales company had received a number of fraudulent orders between June and September last year and was later asked to return the money from these about ?18,000 to HSBC.However, Easy claims that HSBC should have done more to investigate the causes of the fraud, which Easy believes were the result of insufficient security at other banks, rather than its own payment systems.?Normally transactions where the cardholder is not present are at the merchants' risk,? says Nick Glynne, managing director of Easy. ?But in this case, we had followed all the safety checks verifying addresses and reconfirming orders with customers on theirlandlines. The only way the fraudsters could have got through was by breaching the bank's security.?Mr Glynne believes banks have little incentive to investigate fraud thoroughly because they can pass the liabilities on to the retailers.?Banks are doing very little about this. They …don't investigate how the fraud happened at all.? HSBC, however, says it is confident it will beat the challenge. James Roper, chief executive of the Interactive Media Retail Group, says Easy's story is a familiar one. ?The chargeback has been the bane of internet retailers' lives for the last 10 years,? he says. ?I have heard many horror stories on this.?The Association of Payment Clearing Services, the trade body governing electronic payments, says ?150m was lost last year through fraudulent action when the card was not present. About ?117m of this was from transactions over the internet, with most of theloss borne by retailers. Some measures have been put in place to help redress the balance. Apacs and the banking industry spend ?3m a year funding a police unit that focuses on internet fraud and helps retailers minimise their risks.A new website aimed at training managers and staff on how to spot identity fraud was launched on Thursday by Apacs, the British Bankers' Association, and Cifas, the fraud protection service.The most important development, however, is that since last year, Visa and Mastercard have offered verification services Verified by Visa and Secure Mastercode that are designed to reduce retailers' risk. If retailers sign up to the service, the risk of online transactions made using the system reverts to the banks.However, the system suffered early teething problems and covers only a portion of retailers. Visa estimates that 10,000 retailers in Europe use its system today, but there will be a long way to go before it is ubiquitous. In addition, neither Verified by Visa nor Secure Mastercode cover transactions taken by internet retailers over the phone.These, says Mr Glynne, can still account for a significant part of an internet retailer's revenues. ?Customers often prefer to order over the telephone for complex equipment. They agonise over their requirements and need advice,? he says. ?If we stopped selling over the phone, it would wipe out half our profits.?Visa and Mastercard are testing security technology that would cover telephone transactions as well for example, using small devices that generate dynamic passwords for banking customers. This technology could be introduced next year.But until this or another viable security option is in place, tension between the banks and retailers is likely to continue.
575;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
576;V;Visa Inc;2005-03-31T23:24:04Z;Warning to EU on passport deadline;;The chairman of the congressional committee overseeing US immigration laws warned on Thursday that Congress was unlikely to extend an October deadline for the European Union to adopt biometric passports.The warning, from Republican James Sensenbrenner, raises the possibility that many European travellers to the US could be forced to acquire visas after the October 26 deadline, adding substantially to the time and expense involved in visits to the US.In a letter to the European Commission, Mr Sensenbrenner said Congress was “unlikely” to respond to the EU's request for a longer deadline.“The increased awareness and concern, of both the American public and most members of Congress regarding continued weakness in US border security, will make an additional extension difficult to accomplish,” he wrote. “I strongly suggest that the European Commission plan without the expectation that there will be an extension of the deadline.”The visa-waiver scheme, under which travellers from 27 mostly European countries can easily enter the US, has been criticised by some Republicans in Congress as a loophole that could be exploited by terrorists.In an effort to appease those concerns, the US has insisted that all visa-waiver countries adopt passports with fingerprints or other biometric data incorporated in the documents to help safeguard against stolen passports being used by terrorists to enter the US.Visa-waiver countries account for about 13m travellers to the US each year, and the State Department lacks the resources to begin issuing visas to those travellers.
577;V;Visa Inc;2005-03-04T18:02:28Z;On Asia: Making Asian money work harder;;"Since moving to Asia almost two years ago, I have become suspicious of the word “development”.most people living in Europe have simple concept of the world: developed countries to the west, developing countries to the east and south. And if US television is anything to go by, I fear that in the States, the average citizen’s world view is even more simplistic.In Asia things are more complicated. Thailand is, of course, less developed than Britain if you look at gross domestic product per capita, televisions per inhabitant and other conventional metrics. But step on to the streets of Bangkok and within two minutes you will find a clean, metered taxi with an English-speaking driver. Compare that with the hopeless scramble for a
cab on a late evening in London’s West End and tell me, who’s more developed?And I still haven’t found a system such as Octopus,
a charge card that enables Hong Kong residents to do anything from taking the metro to buying milk.In fact, every swipe of the Octopus reminds me of sulking waiters in French restaurants, or sleepy shop assistants in Italian towns proudly proclaiming they do not take Visa.In financial markets, similar assumptions apply: the US, the UK and Europe are perceived to be ahead of Asia in the capitalist stakes. A recent report* by the McKinsey Global Institute, an independent research unit within the management consultancy, offers an insight on the issue.The report looks at how different markets use and grow their “financial stock” – bank deposits, government and corporate debt, and equities – in order to understand how capital markets are evolving.With regards to Asia, four themes emerge:■ Asia’s share of global wealth has fallen over the past decade as the rate of growth in the region’s financial stock lagged the rest of the world;■ Bank deposits and government debt make up a disproportionate amount of Asia’s financial stock compared with the US and Europe;■ Japan – the region’s anchor economy – has failed to drive Asia’s financial expansion due to its economic stagnation and a surge in government debt;■ China is already a world power in terms of bank deposits – frighteningly, 9 per cent of global deposits are in the country’s pathetic banking system – but its contribution in terms of equity and debt is still small.So what does that mean? A superficial view would suggest that Asia’s capital markets are still “developing”. The MGI study offers some evidence of this. When more than 40 per cent of the region’s $27,000bn-worth of financial stock sits idly in banks – double the US level – it is hard to argue that Asia is a sophisticated financial arena.But that is a snapshot of the past; looking forward, Asia’s markets have plenty to smile about. For a start, it is inconceivable that the region’s financial stock will continue growing at a slower pace than the US and Europe. With Asia’s economies set to outpace the rest of the world and continued improvements in capital markets, its share of global financial stock will rise from the current 23 per cent. That rise is likely to be driven by a rebalancing in the composition of the region’s wealth away from bank deposits into equities and debt.The reason is simple. As Asians grow richer, they will want their money to work harder. At the same time, companies and governments are becoming increasingly confident in tapping the capital markets. And that is where the opportunity for international investors and financial companies lies. As billions of dollars in funds leave the banks’ vaults in search of better returns, they should be able to capture it, redirect it and make money out of it.Just imagine what an optimistic equity banker could do with the following statistic: if 5 per cent of Asia’s bank deposits shift into equity, that would make $550bn available
for initial public offerings, share purchases and mutual funds. If that were to happen, say, in the next five years, that would give a yearly average of $110bn worth of demand for equity, almost 60 per cent higher than this year’s forecast IPO volume.If those numbers prove true, Octopus will have to add IPO subscriptions to the card’s many features.* “Taking Stock of the World’s Capital Markets”"
578;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Visa, Microsoft, eBay combat ?phishing';;Visa, Microsoft and online marketplace eBay on Monday announced a global service to combat identity theft on the internet with reported ?phishing? incidents currently growing at nearly 25 per cent a month.The Phish Report Network was launched as more than 10,000 online security experts gathered in San Francisco for the RSA conference the industry's biggest annual event. Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, is expected to detail his company's latest moves to combat security breaches in its software, in the opening keynote address today. Visa, Microsoft, eBay, its payment subsidiary PayPal and security firm WholeSecurity said the Phish Report Network was the internet's first global anti-phishing aggregation service.Phishing refers to the practice of e-mails being sent to users purporting to be from institutions such as their bank and urging them to click on a web link to update their online account information. The link leads to a fake website where inputting details risks giving fraudsters access to actual bank accounts.The new network allows companies targeted by phishing attacks to report them to a central database. Then others devising software to alert users or block them from phishing sites, such as Microsoft, would be immediately notified by the network, enabling them to update their programs.The Anti-Phishing Working Group, involving the industry and law enforcement agencies, reported a 24 per cent month-to-month rise in phishing attacks from August to December 2004.Microsoft regularly updates its software on users' computers over the internet, as hackers and viruses repeatedly breach programs such as its Internet Explorer browser. A week ago, it released patches covering 17 security flaws, including eight ?critical? fixes.Analysts expect Mr Gates to reveal more about ?Active Protection? technologies in development, including software that can block users from opening files identified as likely to contain viruses. An annual study released yesterday by RSA, the security firm that started the conference, suggested a continuing reluctance by consumers to do business online due to security concerns.Nearly a quarter of more than 1,000 respondents were reducing their online shopping and one-fifth refused to work with their financial institutions via the internet.Art Coviello, RSA chief executive, told the FT interview that online security was ?still woefully far behind where it needs to be.??This is mostly because the Microsoft operating system and the Linux one were never designed to deal with the broad access now available through the web. I don't think we've even begun to see how sophisticated these attacks have become.?
579;V;Visa Inc;2005-01-30T22:02:09Z;Visa rules hurting US, warns Gates;;Bill Gates says the tough US visa regime has caused a decline in foreign computer science students so severe it is threatening to undermine America's position in the global software industry.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Microsoft chairman, whose company is one of the world's biggest employers of international computer talent, branded the fall in student numbers a “disaster”.The US's status as “the IQ magnet of the world” was in jeopardy as a result of the tougher immigration rules that were introduced in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, he suggested. “There has been a 35 per cent drop in Asians coming to our computer science departments,” Mr Gates said. “It really is a very bad thing for a very key area.”Officials at US universities are concerned about the fall in overseas students as applications are held up by visa problems. Last year Larry Summers, president of Harvard University, warned that the US would lose “incalculable benefits” if the next generation of foreign leaders chose to be educated elsewhere.Mr Gates pointed to the sharp difference between emerging markets such as India and China, where about 40 per cent of students take engineering degrees, and the US, where the proportion is about 4 per cent.As finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 group of industrial nations prepare to gather in London this week with currency movements on the agenda, Mr Gates revealed he was betting the dollar would continue to fall. “I have a bias. I'm short the dollar,” he said.
580;V;Visa Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;The nitty-gritty of going solo;;"With all the latest management jargon, from inspiration to innovation and creativity to cultural intelligence, it may seem at best humdrum and at worst distinctly boring for a company to engage some of the best business-school brains to help improve the way processes are carried out.But for a company such as Visa Europe, the card payments organisation that represents some 5,000 European banks and financial institutions, the reputation of both it and its member banks depends on the quality of the management processes when it introduces change.""The question is, how do you get it right first time, every time,"" says David Joyce, head of customer services in Visa Europe's payment processing services department. The question has become particularly critical at Visa Europe over the past year.On July 1 last year Visa Europe was incorporated as a separate organisation from its parent, Visa, and the European company took control of its own information technology systems.At the same time the organisation had to roll out the chip-and-pin anti-fraud technology rapidly across its member institutions.So Visa Europe turned to IMD in Lausanne, Switzerland, with which it had worked several times in the past, to help develop new processes for introducing change.Dealing with the nitty-gritty of processes is not everyone's cup of tea, acknowledges Xavier Gilbert, professor of international business dynamics at IMD. ""Project planning is like whisky,"" he says. ""It is an acquired taste.""Some of the six Visa Europe managers charged with developing the change processes had already acquired the taste for it, some had not. But it was by mixing managers from IT, finance, human resources and marketing, and from several European countries that Visa Europe was hoping to get the best results. ""Two of the six will open it up; four will try and close it down,"" predicted Mr Joyce.The six people comprised one of seven project teams participating in last autumn's Booster programme from IMD, a curious hybrid of an open enrolment and a customised programme. (Visa Europe also had a second team participating in the Booster programme.)Each team was charged with working through a management issue at their organisation with the help of IMD faculty and staff - much as organisations would do on a customised programme. But for the plenary sessions, all the groups from different organisations worked together, as is customary on an open- enrolment project. As with many customised projects, interdepartmental communications was one of the goals, says Mr Joyce. ""One of the objectives is to get people from right across the organisation working together.""Although the biggest benefits to the Visa Europe team were in this ""custom"" part of the course, there were some advantages in working with other companies in other sectors - in this case the food, construction and healthcare sectors - says Sarah Goodbody, the team leader. Their corporate culture and their input to the sessions were very different to that of Visa, she says. ""For our group it was quite an eye-opener …It made us appreciate our culture.""The biggest advantage the Booster programme has over a traditional customised programme is the cost, says Thomas Malnight, professor of strategy and general management at IMD and director of the programme.The Booster one-week programme comes in two formats. The basic variety - the Visa Europe experience - costs SFr100,000 (£45,000); the extended version, which includes more coaching in the company before and after the programme, costs SFr170,000. But as Prof Malnight points out, traditional in-company programmes are much, much more expensive. ""This is one common process, seven mini projects,"" he says.Even with the (non- extended) Booster programme, IMD has some input before the course. Prof Gilbert, for example, visited Visa Europe in London several weeks before the programme began to determine the aims and the organisational nuances of the project.This preamble also helps IMD determine that the top management in the company supports the project and also that it isof adequate scope, says Prof Malnight. ""We would discourage someone from sending in a project which is not important.""The sponsors in the company have to be involved at both the beginning and end of the programme. The directors sponsoring the Visa Europe programme flew to Lausanne as the week came to its conclusion to hear the team present its ideas. The bosses were ""very positive"", says Ms Goodbody, and Prof Gilbert was ""incredibly insightful"" in his comments.At the beginning of the process Mr Joyce was reluctant to state too specifically what he wanted the project to achieve, for fear of stifling new ideas.""Success looks like some sort of process aligned with some sort of organisational change,"" he hazards. ""What we want are simple decision-making criteria."" The bottom line is that there would always be a financial benefit, he adds.At the end of the day, this is what the team recommended - a ""mini department"" through which all proposals above a certain cost, plus all changes that affected other departments, must be processed.Since returning to their offices in mid November, the team has had weekly working sessions and each member of the Visa Europe group has spent between 30 and 40 per cent of their working week on the details of the project and on finalising the proposal.Although all departments will be involved in the changes, it is the IT department that will be most affected, says Ms Goodbody.For Mr Joyce, the initial aim of getting people to work together across departments was achieved. ""It's great to see a group of people working together as they did.""Ms Goodbody also believes this was one big benefit from the programme. ""One comment I had [from one of the team] was: 'I've learnt to trust people from other departments who speak a completely different language.' ""The final proposal will go to the Visa Europe board next month. Only then will the team discover just how successful its project has been."
581;V;Visa Inc;2005-01-16T21:41:31Z;Beijing Olympics heads for $1bn from sponsors;;Corporate sponsorship of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing is on course for a record figure of more than $1bn (€760m), confirming China's new-found status as a magnet for trade and investment.Deals already agreed with six sponsors including Volkswagen, Bank of China and China Mobile are set to raise about $600m as large groups rush to promote their brands in China.“They will absolutely reach the figure of $1bn,” said Gerhard Heiberg, chairman of the International Olympic Committee's marketing commission. “I think Beijing will break all records.”The sponsorship bonanza provides commercial justification for the IOC's gamble of entrusting the Games to China. By voting to stage the most spectacular show in sport in the world's most populous market, the IOC shrugged off concerns about human rights.The sums raised by Beijing will also remind the five main contenders for the 2012 Games London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris that hosting the Olympics brings opportunities as well as risks. The 2012 host will be chosen in July.The 2008 Games should be an important landmark as China opens up to the outside world, just as the 1964 Games in Tokyo and the 1988 Olympics in Seoul did for Japan and South Korea.The Beijing domestic sponsorship figures exclude amounts raised by the IOC's so-called “TOP” worldwide sponsorship programme for multinational companies. In the 2001-04 Olympic cycle which covered the Salt Lake City and Athens Games 11 TOP sponsors put up $603m. They included Coca-Cola, Kodak, Visa International and Samsung.Athens is understood to have raised €248m from domestic sponsorship. Broadcasting was the Olympic movement's biggest source of funds in 2001-04, generating $2.24bn. Sponsorship yielded $1.34bn, ticketing $608m and licensing $81m.
582;V;Visa Inc;2004-12-17T15:00:01Z;It's down to a lack of interest;;Five years after the launch of the single European currency, euro bank accounts have still not taken off in the UK.“Although the euro is a part of everyday life in many countries, British banks are still reluctant to offer euro accounts,” says Rachel Thrussell, savings research editor at Moneyfacts, the data provider.“Only a handful of onshore euro current and savings accounts have been launched since the euro's introduction and it's the same providers that offered the initial accounts that are still offering them.”She says the limited number of euro accounts available could reflect the heavy cost of development for providers. She predicts that unless Britain takes on the euro as its currency, euro accounts will be of only limited use. “Unless you're a businessman who gets paid in euros or a property owner with rent being paid in euros there's little need for people to have a euro account. Especially as interest rates on these accounts are so low,” says Thrussell.The accounts currently on offer are the same as those launched a few years ago. They come mainly from the offshore subsidiaries of some of the high street banks, including Abbey, Alliance & Leicester, Barclays, HSBC, Halifax, NatWest and Citibank. These banks also have onshore euro current and savings accounts.A euro account is similar to a sterling account, but with some important differences. Typically, customers will get a Visa debit card denominated in euros. They can use the card to withdraw euros from cash machines at no charge. Some accounts do not offer this facility. Bank of Scotland's euro account, for example, is simply a current account with no cards.Most accounts provide customers with monthly or quarterly statements, access to interbank payment and interest on their credit balances. Customers will not normally receive a chequebook or overdraft facility and will not be able to set up standing orders or direct debits.The Citibank account allows customers to withdraw cash or make purchases using a card, access their account online and use phone banking services. Cater Allen Bank's account changes customer's money from sterling to euros for 1 per cent, but customers need at least £5,000 to open it.One of the reasons euro accounts are not popular is that they pay dismal rates of interest. This is partly because they are linked to the European Central Bank base rate (now 2.75 per cent) rather than the Bank of England's (4.75 per cent).One of the better paying accounts comes from First Active Bank's Offshore euro account which pays 2 per cent on €10,000 rising to 2.15 per cent on €100,000. But many onshore euro accounts, such as the onshore offerings from Citibank, Cater Allen and Natwest and Royal Bank of Scotland pay less than 1 per cent. In spite of low rates, Kathleen Cedergren, head of service for Citigroup, says euro accounts are increasing in popularity. “We've seen a 27 per cent growth in the number of people taking out our euro accounts,” she says. “And the amount held in the accounts is also increasing.Citibank appeals to people who already have an international outlook, so euro accounts to them are about convenience.” Richard Dunn, managing director of Cater Allen is surprised about the lack of interest among other providers. “We regularly review what is going on in this market and there seems to be very little happening among our competitors,” he says. “I think many of the high street banks do not see the need for euro accounts at the moment. But if Britain does take on the euro as its currency then these providers will have a lot of catching up to do.”For those who want to open a euro account, it's relatively simple to do, with banks allowing customers to apply by phone or post. Money can be transferred electronically from your current account or you can send a cheque.

It is seen as a key indicator of how they will fare during the shopping period from Thanksgiving to Christmas.US sales of European and Japanese imports will be closely watched this season as both currencies have strengthened against the dollar.The weak US currency is good news for overseas shoppers, however, and could aid retailers popular with tourists, such as FAO Schwarz, the upmarket toy shop that re-opened its Manhattan flagship store on Thursday.While low-income US consumers may be constrained by higher petrol and home heating oil prices this holiday, there are factors boosting consumer confidence: oil prices are off their highs and the job market shows signs of improvement.On Wednesday the US Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to their lowest level in two months a sign that demand for labour may be strengthening.Paul Cohen, a Visa spokesman, said consumers were not procrastinating and were getting their shopping done. “All the signs are pointing to a good holiday season,” he said. “We think Black Friday will be an early holiday present for retailers.”Retailers such as Wal-Mart and Sears, Roebuck opened at 6am on Friday to promote their “early bird” specials, also known as “door-buster” sales. KB Toys opened at 5am and was offering a one-day sale.Britt Breemer, head of America's Research Group, a consumer research firm, said the early crowds this year were “equal to, if not better than” a year ago. But he added: “The big question mark will be: are the discounts in the stores when the early bird specials are over big enough to keep consumers in the stores?”Scott Krugman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation, said lots of shoppers were out yesterday morning many with packages. “That's the real indicator,” he said. “It's the door-buster sales that are bringing people in.”The NRF, which forecasts US holiday retail sales will rise 4.5 per cent to $219.9bn, estimated that 130m people would go out shopping this weekend 8m more than last year.Becky Sullivan, spokeswoman for The Mills Corporation, a developer and manager of shopping centres, said traffic was up everywhere compared with last year. “People are shopping for more than just toys early in the morning.”One such shopper was Shirley Kiproff, who was at Macy's in Manhattan. She said she planned to spend 20-30 per cent less this holiday. “One has to be price conscious these days and very selective about purchases,” she said.

The 60 guests also contributed £5,000 to the general election fighting fund of Philip Dunne, a Ruffer director who will stand for the Conservatives in Ludlow, a marginal seat held by the Liberal Democrats.Ruffer believes that globalisation and advances in technology will lead to a broadly deflationary global economy, while Congdon argues that inflation is here to stay regardless.Ruffer was critical of the Bush administration's willingness to ignore the budget deficit in the hope of staving off what he regards as an almost inevitable collapse of the dollar.He said: ""America today reminds me of the Victorian Duke of Buckingham, who employed six cooks at his family seat at Stowe, despite living beyond his means.

Peugeot's car factory in Coventry accidentally paid out £10m it didn't have, and its accountants had to do some swift work after discovering it had broken the law. Peugeot Citroën Automobiles UK, British arm of PSA Peugeot Citroën, handed over a £10m dividend to its French parent on March 21 last year.But when auditors took a look at the half-year accounts, they found that it didn't have enough reserves to pay the money, breaching company law. ""Our auditors said we couldn't do it but we had already done it,"" said managing director Tod Evans, who announced his retirement this week.According to accounts filed with Companies House, the dividend was repaid and then paid again in December once profit had reached the required levels. The repayment was ""merely a paper transaction"", so Evans didn't have to demand the cash back from his French bosses just before receiving his silver clock.Cavendish in placeCavendish Corporate Finance has been named European Private Equity Boutique of the Year at awards sponsored by the European Venture Capital Association, Insead and Real Deals.

Now Chinese companies are applying for double the number of visas they need in the hope that they will get half of them.""Prima Technology,one of the Chinese companies that has booked floor space at the Las Vegas CES, said three or four of its Chinese employees had so far had their Visa applications turned down.Prima, part of Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Company, which manufactures a wide variety of products including televisions, computer monitors and telecommunications equipment,and has an office in Washington, had been hoping to bring a 30 to 40-strong contingent to the show.The State Department insisted consular officials were simply applying the law.It said: ""Nothing has changed, all visa applicants have to prove during the interview process that they are not an intending immigrant,""Consular officials, however, concede that some nations' citizens may find it harder than others to prove they plan to return home after their stay in the US.Ms Chupka and other CEA officials fear that many of the Chinese companies that make up a growing contingent of exhibitors and delegates will switch to rival shows outside the US including CeBit, the annual technology fair in Hanover, Germany.But Ms Chupka warned that if nothing was donethe consumer electronics industry and other industries in the US would suffer.Last month a third of the 48 Chinese government economists and business chiefs who planned to attend a Seattle economics conference had their visa applications turned down, prompting protests from the Washington State China Relations Council, which organised the event."

The moves ignited rumours of further bank closures, fuelling a run on deposits.Deposits have since returned to growth, although the rate is lower than before the summer, according to the Association of Russian Banks.The crisis also fuelled a shift from the privately owned banks back to Sberbank, the state-owned savings bank that controls about 65 per cent of the retail market.Heavily concentrated around a small number of powerful industrial and financial groups, the Russian banking system remains one of the most risky in the world. Lending to companies outside these groups remains scant.However, consumer lending is enjoying strong growth. Rapid economic growth and sharply rising incomes in the biggest cities are expected to double consumer lending to $20bn this year, according to Citigroup, one of the top lenders in the sector.
587;V;Visa Inc;2004-10-07T11:33:27Z;Tourism spending in China seen to triple in 2008;;Chinese tourists, Asia?s most avid travellers, are now the biggest spenders in the region by average credit card transaction size, according to Visa, the card supplier.The company also forecast that tourist spending in China would more than triple in 2008 thanks to growing interest in the communist state and the Beijing Olympic four years later.?China right now is the biggest supplier of tourists to the region and is also the largest destination. We see the trend is going to continue,? said James Murray, executive vice president at Visa Asia Pacific.As China continues to relax its tourism policy, the number of mainlanders travelling outside the country rose 63.7 per cent to 16m in the first seven months of this year, according to China National Tourism Administration. The country overtook Japan as Asia?s largest source of tourists last year.According to a report on the spending patterns in Asia of Visa cardholders, Chinese cardholders on average spent $253 per transaction while travelling in Asia Pacific last year, $50 higher than Spanish tourists who were the second biggest spenders.Chinese tourists used their credit cards most often on education - such as university fees and school books for overseas study - and jewellery.Mr Murray said one factor contributing to the high per transaction spending for mainland tourists was that only 3m Chinese, the most well-off, are international Visa cardholders. As the figure is expected to surge to 51m in 2008, the average transaction size is set to drop.In contrast, tourists from US and UK, which together have 520m Visa cardholders, were the largest spending groups by country of origin in Asia last year, accounting for a third of the total value of transactions. But their average spending were just $135 and $141, respectively.Meanwhile, Mr Murray expected tourist spending in China to grow to $60bn in 2008 from $18bn last year. In the first eight months of this year, the number of travellers visited China grew 22 per cent to 71m, CNTA said.?With China joining the WTO and the Beijing Olympic in 2008, people want to go there,? he said.About 90m tourists visited Asia Pacific last year, spending about $100bn in the region, compared with 95m people and $95bn in 2002.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,952.40.The indices were undeterred by government data saying new orders at US factories fell more than expected in August. While this bodes ill for the fortunes of the US industrial sector, some economists have expressed concern about consumer spending, rather than industrial activity.Wal-Mart highlighted those concerns when it said growth at stores open at least one year last month reached the low end of its forecast range. However, its shares rose 0.3 per cent to $53.31.Merrill Lynch pointed out ""powerful internals"" fuelling the rally in US stocks, such as sharply-rising volume and a favourable advance-decline ratio. In addition, Merrill said: ""Portfolio managers are sitting on a lot of cash and equity fund flows do seem to have picked up in September …leaving investors with some buying power"".Optimistic assessments from two officials at the Federal Reserve also boosted the buyers' cause in morning trading. Governor Ben Bernanke said the US economy could accommodate high energy prices, while Anthony Santomero, president of the Philadelphia Fed, forecast US gross domestic growth of between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent through next year.The third-quarter earnings season kicks off on Thursday when Alcoa, the Dow component and the world's largest aluminium group, announced results. General Electric, the conglomerate and another Dow component often seen as a bellwether for the US economy, reports earnings on Friday.However, sceptics were not silenced by the recent buying on Wall Street and pointed out that oil was still close to the psychologically-important $50 per barrel mark. In addition, bears said earnings growth at US companies was bound to slow from its persistently high pace in recent quarters, which even bulls have admitted is unsustainable.Among other stocks in the news, SunGard Data Systems rose 10.6 per cent to $27 after the financial technology provider said it would spin off its disaster recovery division.General Mills shares finished flat at $45.26 after the company, best known for breakfast cereals, said it would buy back 16.5m shares from Diageo. The transaction would be financed by selling bonds, that will convert into General Mills shares in 2007, to an affiliate of Lehman Brothers.Merck shares rose 2.8 per cent to $34.23 after Barron's, the weekly newspaper, said they could rebound in the wake of a 26 per cent hammering taken on Thursday last week, when the company announced a worldwide drug recall.XM Satellite Radio shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $29.88 after the company said it added less subscribers to its services than expected and announced a slowdown in production of its receivers late on Friday.Shares in Pfizer added 1.1 per cent to $31.30 after some analysts said the company’s earnings could benefit significantly if patients taking Merck’s withdrawn drug Vioxx switch to Pfizer’s rival pill.Among financials, American Express and MBNA saw shares add 1.9 per cent to $52.63 and 0.9 per cent to $25.68, respectively, after rival credit card issuers Mastercard and Visa were told by a US court that they violated anti-trust rules.The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index added 0.8 per cent, paced by Texas Instruments’ 1.7 per cent rise to $23.04 and Advance Micro Devices’ 2 per cent rise to $13.70. Vitesse Semiconductor, however, lost 5.9 per cent to $2.70 after it said it was going to post a loss instead of a profit in the quarter.Siebel Systems shares jumped 14 per cent to $9.34 after the software company raised its earnings forecasts above analysts’ previous estimates thanks to recovering licence revenue.Elsewhere in the business software sector, PeopleSoft was off 2.8 per cent at $22.20 after Microsoft’s chief executive denied the company was going to pursue a rival bid for PeopleSoft to counter Oracle’s.

589;V;Visa Inc;2004-10-04T15:23:49Z;Supreme Court lets stand Visa, MasterCard ruling;;The US Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling that the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations violated federal antitrust law by barring their member banks from issuing credit and charge cards on the rival American Express and Discover Card networks.Without any comment, the justices rejected separate appeals by Visa and MasterCard of a ruling that found their so-called exclusionary rules harmed competition.The Department of Justice opened a case against Visa and MasterCard in 1998, claiming the two stifled competition by forbidding thousands of banks in their networks from issuing American Express and Discover. Visa and MasterCard had appealed to the Supreme Court in a last-ditch attempt to overturn the rulings.Kenneth Chenault, chairman and CEO of American Express, welcomed the decision, saying in a statement it marked the begining of ?a new era of greater choice for US consumers and financial institutions?.The move clears the way for American Express and Morgan Stanley to file a lawsuit, claiming up to a billion dollars in damages from Visa and MasterCard, the world?s two biggest credit card issuers.The two claim that Visa and MasterCard?s actions in barring their member banks from issuing rival credit cards deprived them of hundreds of millions of dollars in business.On Friday, David Balto, a lawyer with Robins, Kaplan, Miller Ciresi, predicted American Express and Discover would have an easy time proving the case since lower courts already ruled rivals were in the wrong.?It?s a very simple case,? Mr Balto said. ?The court has said unambiguously that Visa and MasterCard were liable. It?s just a matter of figuring out the cost of damages.?David Boise, the government?s lawyer who won the antitrust case against Microsoft, has been hired as the lead lawyer for American Express. Lloyd Constantine, who represented US retailers in the antitrust case over debit card fees against Visa and MasterCard settled for $3bn last year, will represent Discover. The suit represents another blow for Visa and MasterCard, which have faced a series of lawsuits in recent years alleging anti-competitive behaviour.

These sponsors get exclusive worldwide marketing rights, including permission to use Olympic symbols on their products. Companies can also become sponsors by supplying equipment, although their marketing rights are more limited.ZTE and Huawei, both based in the southern city of Shenzhen, are talking to the Beijing Olympic Committee about co-operation. Huawei said it was considering supplying equipment.?Sponsorship may be very important, but through other ways you can also promote your brand,? Mr Shi said. ZTE, which has been more cautious in expanding overseas than Huawei, provided 16 stadiums at the Athens Games with broadband internet access through OTE, the Greek telecoms operator. It sent executives to Athens to observe how companies such as Visa and Coca-Cola used the event to promote their brands.ZTE and Huawei, which recently entered the mobile handset market, have been stepping up promotion of their brands at industry conferences overseas and inviting potential customers to visit their headquarters in the hope of overcoming the view that Chinese companies can make only cheap, low-quality goods.Overseas sales accounted for about 20 per cent of ZTE's $1.9bn (?1.6bn) sales last year. The company plans an initial public offering in Hong Kong by the first half of next year.Huawei hopes for international sales of $2bn this year, nearly half of its $5bn sales target for the group.
591;V;Visa Inc;2004-08-03T01:50:51Z;Visa accused of breaching EU competition rules;;The European Commission has charged Visa International, the credit card group, with restricting competition, in breach of European rules.The accusations, which could lead to fines, are contained in a confidential document known as a statement of objections sent to the company on Monday night.The move follows investigations into the business practices of Visa and its rival MasterCard, which together control just less than 90 per cent of the market in Europe. The charges illustrate the Commission?s new emphasis on abuses in the financial services sector. It has launched a drive to crack down on anti-competitive behaviour by bourses, banks and credit card companies.Last month, Commission officials raided the offices of Euronext, the pan-European stock exchange, and earlier this year charged a French credit card group with competition abuses.MasterCard and Visa have already faced a different set of allegations, when the Commission accused them of overcharging retailers. But while MasterCard is still under investigation, Visa struck a deal with the Commission two years ago by promising to reduce charges.The new allegations focus on a decision by Visa, an association of banks and financial services groups, not to admit Morgan Stanley. The US investment bank had wanted to offer card services to shops and merchants in the European Union, but was denied access to Visa customers because the bank has its own credit card.The exclusion, the Commission argues, reduced competition in the ?merchant acquiring market?, which deals with transactions between merchants and card companies. Brussels is concerned that this side of the credit card business suffers from less competition than card issuing.Visa said: ?Morgan Stanley operate the Discover brand credit card a product that competes directly with Visa. We believe, therefore, that allowing Morgan Stanley into the Visa association would give them competitive information which would effectively reduce competition in the market, and that strong competition in the payments industry benefits everyone, particularly consumers.?
