Whirlpool said the fault had not yet caused any serious injuries and that property damage had been minimal in most cases.Whirlpool has previously faced fire safety issues with its products. In July, the group recalled a number of tumble dryer models made between 2004 and 2015. The UK government has attributed at least 750 fires to these dryers.Police also found in 2017 that a faulty fridge-freezer made by Whirlpool under the Hotpoint brand started the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which led to 72 deaths. Whirlpool has contested this finding, telling a government inquiry in 2018 that a cigarette thrown from a flat above was a more likely culprit.“To avoid all risk . . . consumers should unplug their washing machines and not use them,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Otherwise, it added, owners of these models should only use cold water cycles of 20C or lower, which “significantly reduces the risk”.The company has launched an online tool for customers to check whether their own machine is affected, but the website was offline at publication time. Instead, the company was encouraging concerned users to directly message its Twitter account with their washing machine serial number.As part of the recall, Whirlpool will offer customers the choice between a free replacement or in-home repair. The recall will begin in the new year.Whirlpool has pledged an “expanded and far-reaching publicity campaign” around the recall, including full-page advertisements in newspapers, writing to all registered owners of the appliances and running a national radio advertising campaign.Jeff Noel, the company’s head of communications, spoke to the BBC on Tuesday and apologised to customers for disrupting their Christmas holidays.“We especially understand that the washing machine is so important to family life and here at the Christmas holiday season we know that it will be even more of an important matter for our customers, and for that we apologise,” he said.
1;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2019-01-28T22:26:50Z;Whirlpool forecast a wash amid tariff costs;Appliance maker has raised prices to offset cost increases;Whirlpool said Monday it swung to a profit in the fourth quarter driven by higher prices and sales in North America, though the appliance maker’s 2019 outlook disappointed investors.Stronger prices for its products and fixed cost reduction boosted Whirlpool’s bottom line in the quarter ending December 31, despite headwinds from tariffs, higher freight costs and raw material inflation, the company said.But for 2019, Whirlpool provided guidance that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates, citing a higher tax rate and cost and currency increases. The Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company expects to earn between $14 and $15 a share on an ongoing basis, while analysts polled by Refinitiv had forecast earnings of $15.99 a share.“We remain committed to driving profitable growth through strong global price/mix and unwavering cost discipline, while also delivering sustainable working capital improvements,” Jim Peters, Whirlpool’s chief financial officer, said in a statement.Whirlpool is among the lengthy list of companies raising prices to help recoup an increase in labour, freight and commodity costs. The company was seen as an early beneficiary of new tariffs under President Donald Trump, who approved levies on imported washing machines. However separate tariffs, particularly on steel and aluminium, have contributed to rising prices for raw materials used by manufacturers like Whirlpool.Caterpillar said Monday that it expects higher costs to mostly offset its price increases this year. The construction equipment builder, along with chipmaker Nvidia, also said a slowdown in China would impact financial results, a warning that sent a shockwave through the broader stock market.Whirlpool’s net earnings for the fourth quarter hit $170m, or $2.64 a share, compared with a loss of $268m in the year-ago period, when it booked a one-time charge related to US tax reform. Earnings per share on an ongoing basis rose to $4.75 from $4.10, better than analysts’ forecast of $4.23, according to Refinitiv.Net sales dropped about 0.7 per cent to $5.66bn. Analysts were looking for $5.76bn in revenue.In North America, net sales grew about 7 per cent to $3.1bn. Whirlpool’s sales in Asia were $372m, up from $358m, while sales declined in Latin America and the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa segment.Whirlpool shares, which are up 16 per cent year-to-date, fell 6.9 per cent in after-hours trade.
2;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2018-07-24T19:15:15Z;US tariffs: tale of two countries;Companies that avoid global supply chains are in fine shape;Sometime presidential candidate John Edwards campaigned as the antidote to “two Americas”: one where the privileged prosper and another where everyone else struggles. There may be two corporate Americas now. One for technology companies built on human capital and digital commerce. And the rest that cannot avert the messiness of global supply chains caught in the crossfire of protectionism and creeping input costs.Late on Monday, Alphabet shrugged off the large EU fine of last week and reported a jump in revenue of 25 per cent, the biggest gain in four years. Its stock hit a record high on Tuesday, a sign that encroaching regulation does not seem to stop its market share gains in digital advertising.It is a different story for America’s industrial stalwarts. Whirlpool, the appliance company, missed earnings targets on Monday. It cited steel costs that had reached “unexplainable” levels, driven in part by the new steel tariff policy. Whirlpool, importantly, also cited increasing oil prices that have made both resin costs and freight transport pricier.Volatile costs give industrial companies at least a partial pass for weak second-quarter earnings. But their underlying business challenges still deserve scrutiny. Harley-Davidson is facing a $2,200 per bike retaliatory tariff from the EU that it has said it will absorb. However, Europe is only now a crucial battleground for the company because its core North American customer is ageing and replacement domestic demand has not developed.US tariff policies are a worsening muddle. Winners and losers are randomly distributed. President Donald Trump’s tariff exemption and waiver policy is equally haphazard. On Tuesday, reports emerged that the US would, remarkably, spend billions in direct aid to farmers hurt by the trade war. There is perhaps a third corporate America: the US of tariff victims with helpful political connections.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
3;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2018-07-23T21:27:44Z;Whirlpool results disappoint on Emea weakness;Raw material inflation and foreign currency impact also blamed;Whirlpool shares were hung out to dry after the US-based maker of large appliances posted disappointing quarterly results driven by weakness in the Emea and raw material inflation and lowered its full-year earnings outlook.Shares in the Michigan-based company fell more than 8 per cent in extended trade after the company said its net sales decreased 3.8 per cent from a year ago to $5.1bn, shy of analysts’ estimates for $5.29bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.On a constant currency basis, sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa fell 12.3 per cent, while sales declined 2.2 per cent in North America and 11.4 per cent in Latin America.Meanwhile, the company swung to a net loss of $657m or $9.50 a share in the three months ended in June, compared with a profit of $189m or $2.52 a share in the year ago period.The second-quarter results were impacted by a $860m asset impairment charge related to the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and a preliminary settlement with the French Competition Authority with a range between $111m and $134m. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $3.20 a share also turned up shy of the $3.46 that analysts had been looking for.“We are pleased to deliver margin expansion in a very challenging cost environment, driven by strong North America margins and significant global price/mix improvement during the second quarter,” said Marc Bitzer, chief executive officer of Whirlpool Corporation.He added: “Despite these positives, our performance in Emea was below expectations. As a result, we are taking strong actions to improve our operational execution, and remain confident that we will deliver value for our shareholders in the coming quarters.”Moreover the company pointed to lower sales volumes, unfavourable foreign currency impacts and raw material inflation. The Trump administration earlier this year imposed tariffs on washing machines imported by rivals LG and Samsung — following Whirlpool’s victory before a trade panel — a move that was viewed as a boost for Whirlpool. However, Mr Trump’s escalating global trade war has been driving up the costs of raw materials and on its last earnings call the company noted that steel and resin — its biggest raw material inputs — prices were up. Whirlpool said in April that US steel was “significantly elevated versus the rest of the world” and resins had been elevated as well.Looking ahead, the company now expects full-year ongoing adjusted earnings in the range of $14.20 to $14.80 a share, down from $14.50 to $15.50 previously and below analyst expectations of $15.63.Whirlpool shares are down 10.6 per cent year-to-date.
4;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2018-04-23T21:21:10Z;Whirlpool shares drop on wishy-washy earnings, guidance;;Whirlpool’s 2018 is off to a soggy start, after the US-based maker of large appliances reported earnings from the past quarter and guidance for the current one that fell short of analysts’ expectations.For the three months ending March 31, Whirlpool raked in $94m in net earnings, or $1.30 a diluted share, down from $153m, or $2.01 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue came in at $4.9bn, up from $4.8bn a year ago but down 0.7 per cent when stripping out the effects of currency.Analysts had been looking for net income of $176m, or $2.51 a share, on sales of $4.95bn, according to Factset data.Whirlpool also trimmed back its full-year earnings guidance by 15 cents, from its previously issued range of $12.45 to $13.45 to $12.30 to $13.30. In issuing the revised guidance it cited pressures from lower global revenue growth and higher raw material prices. On an adjusted basis it maintained its outlook for earnings between $14.50 and $15.50 a share.“We remain focused on maintaining appropriate flexibility to manage external volatility and continue executing our balanced approach to capital allocation,” chief financial officer Jim Peters said. “This flexibility will enable us to return strong levels of cash to shareholders this year through share repurchases and our increased quarterly dividend.”Whirlpool shares fell 7.2 per cent last year as it grappled with raw material inflation and declining unit volume. Nevertheless, it had hoped for a smoother ride in 2018 under the Trump administration, which slapped tariffs on washing machines imported by rivals LG and Samsung following a victory before a trade panel.Whirlpool shares are down another 11.16 per cent so far in 2018.
5;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2018-02-21T04:00:30Z;Turin job losses dent election hopes for Italy’s ruling party;Eurosceptic opposition seizes on Embraco lay-offs to put pro-trade PD on defensive;Italy’s centre-left government is facing a political firestorm less than two weeks before its general election after a unit of Whirlpool, the US appliance maker, confirmed plans to lay off almost 500 staff near Turin and shift production to Slovakia.With opposition parties and the media seizing on the plight of the workers and employee activists blocking roads and chaining themselves to the factory gate, the furore comes at a particularly sensitive time in the campaign for the ruling Democratic party.The PD is struggling to convince voters that the economy has improved on its watch, despite a return to growth and lower unemployment.It has also put the party on the defensive over its pro-EU, pro-trade stance as Eurosceptic, anti-globalisation opposition politicians blamed Brussels for the company’s decision to ditch Italy in favour of Slovakia.“If you have a single currency and a single market, you compete on labour costs, and companies will shift wherever they can pay their workers less,” said Claudio Borghi, economic adviser and parliamentary candidate for the anti-euro Northern League, part of the centre-right coalition leading the polls. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of Brothers of Italy, a far-right nationalist party that is part of the same coalition, said her group would “make sure a similar case . . . will never repeat itself in Italy” if it entered government. “We will defend Italian work and support who creates employment,” she added.Negotiating with people who walk back on deals they have made and show no sense of social responsibility is absolutely uselessEmbraco, the Brazilian unit of Whirlpool responsible for the plant near Turin, announced the lay-offs in January, opening a 75-day window — which ends in late March — to finalise the plan.Carlo Calenda, Italy’s economic development minister, and trade unions representing the workers tried to convince the company to accept other options but this week Embraco confirmed the plans.In an effort to contain the fallout, Mr Calenda flew to Brussels on Tuesday to meet Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner.Mr Calenda has raised questions in Italian media in recent days about whether Slovakia provided fiscal incentives to Whirlpool that could violate state aid rules, and accused countries in central and eastern Europe of engaging in “gigantic social dumping”.He asked Ms Vestager for an exemption from state aid rules for Italy to try to help convince Whirlpool to keep the jobs near Turin. EU officials said they were reviewing a letter received from Rome last week and working to establish the facts. Current competition rules prohibit regional aid linked to relocating activity within the European Economic Area.“[Ms Vestager] assured me the [European] Commission is very intransigent in verifying cases in which there’s a problem of mistaken or illegal use of state aid to attract [companies] from other parts of the EU,” said Mr Calenda.Whirlpool did not respond to requests for comment. Slovakia’s economy ministry said it had no information that “the investor had asked the state for investment aid”, adding: “Slovakia uses the support of investors only in accordance with EU rules.”In a sign of Rome’s growing frustration, Mr Calenda criticised Embraco’s managers in local media, describing them as “riff-raff” and saying they were seeking “war” with the Italian government.“What is certain is that to keep negotiating with people who walk back on deals they have made and show no sense of social responsibility is absolutely useless,” he wrote in a tweet. The affair has caught the public imagination partly because of the election but also because of employee activism.Workers have blocked roads in the Piedmont region, had an audience with Pope Francis — who reportedly urged them to “fight and have faith in the fight” — and staged a protest at the annual Italian song contest in Sanremo. One worker chained himself to the factory gate on Tuesday morning. Leaders of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement have also met the employees. Embraco told the FT in a statement that the decision to proceed with lay-offs and move production was “motivated by the highly competitive compressor industry” and “longstanding complexities” preventing the Italian plant from being profitable.“Embraco is fully aware of its responsibilities towards its employees. The company commits to work in close co-operation with employee representatives, public authorities and local officials to seek tailored and viable solutions for the affected staff,” it said.Additional reporting by Mehreen Khan in Brussels and James Shotter in Warsaw
6;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2018-01-24T21:56:04Z;Tax charge washes out Whirlpool’s profit;;Whirlpool is the latest company to see its quarterly profit swallowed up by a charge related to US tax reform, swinging to an unexpected loss even as the appliance maker looks to make up ground in 2018 thanks to the Trump administration’s latest trade actions.Michigan-based Whirlpool said on Wednesday that net sales came in at $5.7bn for the three months ending December 31, a 1 per cent year-over-year increase but 1.6 per cent lower after currency effects were stripped out. Analysts were looking for sales to come in at $5.8bn, according to Factset.Its profits were wiped out by a one-time non-cash charge of about $420m related to tax reform, bringing it to a loss of $268m, or $3.69 a share.Whirlpool shares fell back 7.22 per cent in 2017, as the company grappled with rising raw-material costs and declining unit volume. Nevertheless, it is looking for smoother sailing in 2018, after a trade panel handed it a victory last year that led the Trump administration to slap tariffs on washing machines imported by rivals LG and Samsung.For 2018, Whirlpool said it is looking for earnings per diluted share of $12.45-$13.45, and ongoing earnings per diluted share in the range of $14.50-$15.50.Marc Bitzer, Whirlpool’s chief executive, said: “”Our unique global strategic position, coupled with favourable macroeconomic conditions, gives us strong confidence towards our long-term value creation goals. The solid fourth-quarter exit run rates, and faster than anticipated progress on price/mix and fixed cost reduction, are very encouraging in that respect.”Whirlpool shares dropped 1 per cent in after-hours trading.
7;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-11-30T06:00:59Z;LG Electronics announces leadership shake-up;;LG Electronics has reshuffled its top executives, including the head of its struggling mobile division, in an attempt to breathe new life into the South Korean company as its mobile business remains in the red despite a sharp increase in overall earnings.The company on Thursday named Hwang Jeong-hwan as president of its mobile business to replace Juno Cho, who will take on a new role within the group’s parent company. Mr Hwang, a veteran in research and development, was closely involved in developing one of LG’s first smartphones in 2009, the company said.LG posted a 82.2 per cent jump in third-quarter operating profit to Won516bn ($454m) on strong sales of premium home appliances and televisions, which offset continued losses at its mobile business. But its mobile division suffered losses for the tenth consecutive quarter as it remained squeezed by lower-cost Chinese rivals and premium competitors such as Samsung and Apple. The division posted an operating loss of Won375.3bn in the September-June period.LG also named Park Il-pyong, head of the company’s software centre, as its new chief technology officer while Han Chang-hee, vice president of appliance marketing, has been tapped to lead the company’s global marketing drive. LG’s home appliance business is enjoying 8.5 per cent operating profit margins but is facing external headwinds amid growing trade protectionism from the US.Last week, the US International Trade Commission recommended tariffs to keep LG and Samsung from flooding the US market in a move to protect American appliance giant Whirlpool. US President Donald Trump is expected to make a final decision by early next year on what remedy the US will impose against the Korean companies.Shares of LG Electronics fell 0.9 per cent to Won90,600 on Thursday afternoon in line with the Kospi benchmark index, which fell about 1 per cent amid a region-wide sell-off in tech stocks.
8;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Whirlpool shares soaked as it cuts some ties with Sears;;Whirlpool shares took a hit on Tuesday after it confirmed reports that it will no longer be selling its company-branded appliances at Sears department stores, raising questions about its ability to rebuild momentum as it struggles with rising material costs.The Michigan-based company saw its shares drop more than 10 per cent in morning trading, putting it on track for the biggest one-day drop in a year. The fall comes a day after Whirlpool cut its full-year profit guidance in response to raw-material cost inflation and unfavourable pricing dynamics.On Tuesday, media reports said that Sears would no longer carry certain Whirlpool products. Company executives confirmed that during an investor call on Tuesday morning, saying that they had informed Sears in a letter in May that it would “no longer supply Whirlpool branded products” due to a failure to “reach terms that were acceptable to both parties.”It will still continue to supply products to Sears under the Kenmore brand, according to chief executive Marc Bitzer. He declined to delve into specifics about the nature of the disagreement, although some media reports indicated it had to do with a pricing dispute.Whirlpool — which specialises in large household appliances like refrigerators and washing machines — previously said that it was planning to raise prices on some of its products to help offset the rising costs of raw materials, as it has in the past. It expects raw material inflation to reach $600m in 2017 and 2018 combined.While Sears’ partnership with Whirlpool stretches back more than a century, Whirlpool’s business with Sears has “declined over time” and now represents just 3 per cent of its global business, with the Whirlpool-branded segment representing “a small fraction” of that, Mr Bitzer said.It may not make up a significant chunk of Whirlpool’s business, but the split comes at a time when the company is looking to boost its sagging margins and reassure investors by raising prices and cutting costs.It is also facing challenges including the ongoing integration of Italian appliance maker Indesit, which it purchased in 2014, as well as competition in its key North American market from rivals LG and Samsung.Tuesday’s drop brings the company’s year-to-date share price loss to 9.8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
9;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-10-23T20:55:30Z;Whirlpool outlook soiled by material costs, price mix;;Whirlpool shares took a tumble on Monday evening after the appliance maker cut its full-year earnings guidance, blaming the rising cost of raw materials and an unfavourable pricing dynamic.The company said that it is now looking for full-year earnings per diluted share between $11.10 and $11.40, and $13.60 to $13.90 on an ongoing basis. That compares to previous guidance for earnings per diluted share of $12.40 to $12.90, or $14.50 to $15.00 on an ongoing basis.The guidance revision came as Whirlpool announced third-quarter revenue of $5.4bn for the three months ending September 30, a 3 per cent rise from the same period a year earlier and just below the $5.5bn that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected.Net earnings available to Whirlpool came in at $276m for the quarter, versus the $238m from a year earlier. Earnings per diluted share were $3.72, up from $3.10 a year ago and ahead of the $3.01 that Wall Street was looking for.Marc Bitzer, chief executive of the Michigan-based company, said that while the company was pleased with its revenue growth and free cash flow improvement, it was “not satisfied with our operating margins, which were impacted by raw material inflation, unfavourable price/mix and slow progress on our European integration.”As part of those efforts, Whirlpool announced “global cost-based price increases on a majority of its business” to mitigate the effect of rising raw materials costs, as well as a $150m fixed cost reduction initiative. It said it is still looking for global shipments to remain flat or rise as much as 2 per cent in 2017.Whirlpool shares, which are up just 0.5 per cent since the start of 2017, fell more than 7 per cent in after-hours trading before climbing back slightly to trade down more than 6 per cent.
10;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-10-05T20:47:08Z;US trade ruling set to hand Trump tariff firepower;Whirlpool said to have suffered from imports of LG and Samsung washing machines;Donald Trump is set to be handed an opportunity to impose tariffs or other restrictions on imports of washing machines made by two of South Korea’s biggest industrial groups just as his administration sets about renegotiating a trade deal with Seoul, an important strategic ally.On Thursday the US International Trade Commission ruled unanimously that US appliance maker Whirlpool had suffered “serious injury” from an increase of imports of large home washing machines made by LG and Samsung.The decision in a case brought under a rarely used US statute allowing broad “safeguards” to combat surging imports sets the stage for the ITC to recommend tariffs and other possible restrictions to the president by early December.It is part of a wave of new cases brought by US companies against foreign competitors that are set to give Mr Trump the opportunity to impose the tariffs that he is said to crave as part of an “ America First” trade policy that he argues will bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.The ITC last month ruled in favour of US solar cell manufacturers in a similar safeguards case. Also in the spotlight is a case brought by Boeing against Canada’s Bombardier over its new line of passenger jets that has drawn objections and threats from the governments of Canada and the UK.“The ITC vote is an important win for American manufacturers and American workers,” said Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool’s chairman. “This vote sets the stage for the administration to put in place an effective remedy to create a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers. This type of corrective action will create US manufacturing jobs.”This vote sets the stage for the administration to put in place an effective remedy to create a level playing field for American workers and manufacturersBut the latest ruling also highlights how commercial and trade disputes as well as geopolitics have become more tangled under the Trump administration.The ITC ruling comes amid a crisis over North Korea’s missile and nuclear tests that the US and South Korea are working on, and just a day after the two allies agreed to try to improve a 2012 trade deal that the president has been threatening to pull out of. It also comes just months after both LG and Samsung announced plans to open new factories in the US in moves celebrated by Mr Trump’s administration.Whirlpool, which is based in Michigan, said it needed broad restrictions on washing machine imports to prevent LG and Samsung from getting around previous tariffs to combat alleged dumping — or sale at artificially low prices — of washing machines in the US.But Samsung and LG have accused Whirlpool of playing politics and trying to manipulate US trade laws to make up for its failure to keep up with consumer tastes that have seen Korean washing machines sell well.They also argue that the Trump administration risks sending a dangerous signal to foreign investors if it approves restrictions on imports that could end up targeting not just finished products but also international supply chains.Samsung said it was also concerned that any potential remedies could hurt its plans to build a new home appliance factory in South Carolina.“We believe that safeguard remedies should not discriminate in favour of one group of US-based workers over another and should not negatively impact a fair appliance marketplace for consumers,” the company said.The ITC is set to give its recommendation to Mr Trump by December 4.
11;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-10-05T17:04:21Z;Whirlpool claims victory in trade case over imported washing machines;;Whirlpool shares bumped slightly higher on Thursday after the US-based appliance maker declared victory in a petition it filed with a US trade panel over large washing machines imported by rivals Samsung and LG.The US International Trade Commission — a federal agency that investigates trade issues — said on Thursday that it had “determined that large residential washers are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article in the United States.”Now that a determination has been issued, the ITC will move on to decide what remedy to impose, such as tariffs, trade restrictions or other measures.The determination comes in response to a petition filed by Whirlpool earlier this year accusing Samsung and LG of illegally flooding the US market with cheaper imported washing machines, which it claimed had hurt its washer sales in its critical North American market.In 2013, the US government had previously found Samsung and LG were illegally dumping washing machines made at facilities in South Korea and Mexico. As a result, Whirlpool claimed, the companies moved their operations to other countries to circumvent those country-specific rulings, prompting it to bring the petition earlier this year seeking a broader determination.Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool’s chairman, said in a statement on Thursday:“The ITC vote is an important win for American manufacturers and American workers. For the third time since 2013, the ITC has found that Samsung and LG engaged in unlawful conduct by violating US trade laws. This vote sets the stage for the administration to put in place an effective remedy to create a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers. This type of corrective action will create US manufacturing jobs.”Whirlpool said it expects a hearing on possible remedies to be held October 19. The ITC will then vote on what remedy to impose on November 21, and make its written recommendation to President Donald Trump by December 4. The White House will have two months to consider those recommendations and make a final decision.South Korea-based LG said in a statement on Thursday that slapping restrictions on imported washing machines “will only hurt consumers by raising prices and decreasing choices, while jeopardizing US investment and job growth.”The company noted it is building a washer manufacturing facility in Tennessee, which it said will employ about 600 workers. “Soon, competition in the washer market will not be about domestic vs foreign production,” LG said.Samsung, also based in South Korea, echoed LG’s disappointment, noting that it “remain(ed) committed to establishing our North American home appliance manufacturing facility” in South Carolina.“We believe that safeguard remedies should not discriminate in favor of one group of US-based workers over another and should not negatively impact a fair appliance marketplace for consumers,” the company said in a statement.Whirlpool shares, which are up almost 14 per cent in the past 12 months, rose another 0.6 per cent on Thursday.
12;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-09-22T15:58:54Z;US business hands Trump his tariff moment;Several trade cases may allow president to fulfil his protectionist promises;Donald Trump has become increasingly frustrated with his administration’s inability to deliver the nationalist trade agenda — and bold tariffs — he promised during his campaign. Now some US companies may be about to rescue him from that frustration. Trade cases involving Chinese solar cells, South Korean washing machines and Canadian jets are expected to land on the president’s desk in the coming weeks. Each has its own complexities, and each faces opposition both at home and abroad. Yet they may prove hard to resist for a president eager to wield his protectionist pen. The cases and the tariffs that seem likely to emerge from them also illustrate the duelling personalities that corporate America is now displaying on trade. Much of the US business community has been working furiously to convince the White House to preserve pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement that Mr Trump has in his sights. Yet major companies like Boeing and Whirlpool are also finding much to like in the administration’s muscular approach to enforcing anti-dumping and other less-used trade laws. The first of those decisions came on Friday when the International Trade Commission ruled that US-based solar cell makers Suniva and Solarworld had suffered “injury” from cheap imports. The finding sets the stage for the ITC to recommend by November that the president order “safeguards” — or broad-based tariffs — on all imports of solar cells, giving Mr Trump the tariff moment he is said to crave.Similarly, Whirlpool is turning to the administration to restrict imports of washing machines made by South Korean competitors LG and Samsung, which the US company accuses of waging “a relentless assault on US manufacturers . . . and the thousands of American workers they employ”. Like the solar companies, Whirlpool argues that traditional anti-dumping measures targeting specific products from individual countries have failed to stop cheap imports as the South Korean manufacturers have moved production around the world to avoid US duties. America cannot afford to lose another manufacturing industry to imports, particularly one that combines high-tech and renewable energy like the solar industryBoeing, meanwhile, has drawn the ire of Britain’s Theresa May and Canada’s Justin Trudeau over a more traditional anti-dumping case it has brought against Canadian rival Bombardier. Many experts expect that case to be given the green light by Mr Trump’s commerce department on Monday despite lobbying and threats from the two US allies. All three cases have prompted a question: would they have happened if Mr Trump was not president? Trade lawyers in Washington say his administration has been good for business and invited a flurry of inquiries from US companies which see an opening to bring complaints that other administrations might have viewed with scepticism. But other experts are more cautious. “These are not cases that are out of the blue. They have been trying to stop these imports for years,” says Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “But would we have seen them under previous administrations? Maybe not.” The question is particularly pertinent for the “safeguards” cases launched by the solar companies and Whirlpool. Such cases are rare though not without precedent. President George W Bush in 2002 used the same “safeguards” law to impose temporary tariffs on steel imports. The Obama administration in 2009 employed a similar manoeuvre to restrict imports of Chinese tyres. Past administrations have also soured on such trade actions. Beyond drawing the ire of trading partners, studies have shown both the Bush and Obama decisions caused more job losses than gains. One study found the Bush administration’s steel move led to 200,000 Americans — more than were employed in the entire US steel industry — losing their jobs due to higher steel prices.In opposing the solar case, other parts of the solar industry— from home panel installers to companies such as Elon Musk’s Tesla — have argued that tariffs would raise costs and threaten more jobs than they would save. Supporters of Mr Trump’s tough approach counter that protecting “upstream” manufacturing jobs and industries is more important to the US’s long-run economic health than “downstream” jobs. “America cannot afford to lose another manufacturing industry to imports, particularly one that combines high-tech and renewable energy like the solar industry,” the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group of manufacturers which back Mr Trump, wrote to the ITC this month. 2,000Bombardier jobs at risk in Kansas and West Virginia, say members of CongressYet the battle over jobs is also more complex than that. On the face of it Boeing’s case against Bombardier pits a US industrial giant against a Canadian competitor. But the opposition of the UK prime minister, which is based on 3,000 Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland she is eager to protect, points to the company’s global operations, and her concerns are shared by some in the US. In a letter to the Trump administration last month, members of Congress from Kansas and West Virginia complained that 2,000 Bombardier jobs in their own states were at risk. They pointed out that more than half of the parts in the Bombardier C series aircraft Boeing is trying to keep out are US-made. Likewise, Whirlpool’s petition has been opposed by officials from South Carolina, where Samsung in June broke ground on a home appliance factory in a move that drew praise from the Trump administration. “Samsung’s investment is great news for South Carolina and the United States,” Wilbur Ross, Mr Trump’s commerce secretary, said at the time. “And it is a direct reflection of the fact that America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

15;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-07-26T21:38:48Z;Whirlpool shares wash out after outlook cut;;Stronger North American sales weren’t enough to keep Whirlpool’s profits from sinking lower during the second quarter, and the appliance maker has lowered its earnings guidance, blaming rising raw-material inflation and sluggish Chinese and European markets.Whirlpool’s shares fell 4 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after its results for the three months ending June 30 underwhelmed Wall Street. Net income of $189m fell short of the $228.4m that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected, and nearly halved the $320m profit seen in the same period a year earlier.Earnings per diluted share of $2.52* also came in below the $2.99 that Wall Street was looking for, and represented a steep drop from the $4.15 per diluted share seen in the year-ago period.Revenue for the quarter ticked slightly higher to $5.3bn from $5.2bn a year earlier, in line with Wall Street’s expectations. Sales were boosted by a strong showing in Whirlpool’s biggest market in North America, where they increased 9 per cent excluding currency impacts.But sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa declined 5 per cent, alongside a 1 per cent drop in Latin America and flat sales in Asia.Whirlpool blamed the impact of rising raw-material costs alongside the unfavourable product/pricing mix in some markets for the earnings slide, but it said that it was encouraged by the growth in North America.Nevertheless, it dimmed its guidance for full-year earnings. The company is now looking for full-year earnings per share of $12.40-$12.90, and ongoing business earnings per diluted share of $14.50-$15. It had previously targeted a range of $12.65-$13.40 for earnings per share, or $14.75-$15.50 on an adjusted basis.The company’s shares have had a tepid run recently, decreasing 1.2 per cent over the past 12 months. Last week, its shares, along with appliance retailer stocks, were rattled by news that Amazon, the e-commerce giant, had struck a deal with Sears Holdings to sell the latter’s Kenmore home appliances online.*This post has been updated to reflect that earnings per share were $2.52.

His replacement will be Marc Bitzer, who is currently Whirlpool’s chief operating officer and president.The changes will take effect on October 1, the company said.Mr Fettig said in a statement:“My primary role is to support Whirlpool, Marc and our leadership team in this planned CEO transition. I am effectively stepping away from our day-to-day management after 36 years of service and the last 13 as CEO.”He also touted Mr Bitzer’s appointment as Whirlpool’s eighth chief executive in 106 years:“Marc has a deep understanding of our business throughout the world and has personally led our operations and delivered strong results during his 18-year tenure at Whirlpool. As we prepare for the future, I am very confident that Marc is uniquely qualified to lead our company in continued success.”
17;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-05-11T15:38:53Z;Dow CEO Andrew Liveris given more time on DowDuPont board;;When Dow Chemical completes its $142bn merger with DuPont, Andrew Liveris will stay on as executive chairman of the combined group until April 2018, the company announced on Thursday, giving him a year longer on the board than previously planned.Dow, where Mr Liveris has been chief executive since 2004, said he would be executive chairman of the merged DowDuPont from the time the deal closes until April 1 next year. The deal is scheduled to close in August. He is then expected to stay on as chairman until July 1, when he will step down from the board.The decision gives Mr Liveris an extra year on the board relative to the timetable he set out last year, when he said he planned to leave the company “no later” than the end of the second quarter of 2017.Mr Liveris’s departure will come as the merged group is broken up. It is intended to be split within 18 months into three companies: one in plastics and related materials, one in agricultural chemicals and seeds, and one in other specialty chemicals.Jeff Fettig, Dow’s lead independent director and chief executive of Whirlpool, said in a statement:“Given the complexity, unique structure and Andrew’s role as a key architect of this transaction, the Dow board believes that the continuity of leadership will best serve our shareholders during this critical time of transition. This enables us to achieve the full value-creation promise behind the merger and subsequent intended spins”.The timetable for the merger has slipped because of delays in securing regulatory approvals. The two companies had originally hoped to complete it by the end of 2016.In 2014-15 Mr Liveris was strongly criticised by Third Point, the activist investment fund, which accused him of having “broken promise after promise to Dow shareholders” by missing earnings-growth targets.Analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note last month: “Third Point’s original critique of Dow, the Broken Promises, still holds true, and there is no need to allow Mr. Liveris to taint the new DowDupont company.”
18;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2017-04-24T21:50:31Z;Whirlpool cuts profit guidance over European integration challenges;;Breaking up is hard to do. So, it seems, is getting together.Whirlpool cut its full-year earnings outlook on Monday, placing the primary blame with “temporary integration challenges” in the European, Middle Eastern and Africa market following its 2014 purchase of Italian appliance maker Indesit.The US-based manufacturer of large appliances like washing machines and refrigerators said that it now expects full-year earnings per share to come in at $12.65-$13.40, versus its previous estimate of $13.25-$14.25, due in part to the integration issues. Whirlpool said it has been experiencing “peak complexity” in the EMEA region related to the Indesit integration, which it said led to a “temporary disruption” in its supply-chain network and product availability.“As we continue to execute our plans and work through the elevated complexity of our European integration, we remain confident in our ability to deliver both $1 billion of free cash flow and record earnings per share in 2017,” chief operating officer Marc Bitzer said in a statement.Nevertheless, it said it expects performance in the current quarter to improve, and that improvement to extend into the back half of 2017.Whirlpool’s earnings for the three-month period ending in March fell largely short of Wall Street’s expectations, with net income coming in at $153m for the quarter, translating to $2.01 per diluted share. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected net income of $163.2m and earnings per share of $2.11.Revenue came in at $4.78bn for the quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates and a slight improvement over the $4.6bn reported in the year-ago period.Whirlpool shares, which are down 6 per cent over the past 12 months, were down 0.74 per cent in after-hours trading.
19;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2016-10-25T17:02:53Z;Whirlpool shares take a bath as elections jitters knock sales;;Blame the voters – Whirlpool’s shares tumbled more than 10 per cent on Tuesday after it said that consumer jitters after the UK’s Brexit vote and ahead of the US presidential election had softened third-quarter demand in those markets for washers and other home appliances.Shares of Whirlpool, which had been up about 1 per cent over the past year prior to today, hit an eight-month low on Tuesday after it unveiled earnings that were largely weaker than expected.On Tuesday, Whirlpool reported net sales fell in the third quarter of 2016 to $5.25bn, from $5.28bn during the same three-month period last year and missing the $5.3bn predicted by analysts. The company said revenue was dragged down by a weaker post-Brexit pound and UK consumer demand, and a flurry of promotional activity in the US that it said allowed importing rivals to undercut its prices with cheaper goods.Quarterly net income gained slightly from a year earlier, to $238m, or $3.10 per diluted share, up from $235m, or $2.95 a share, during the third quarter of 2015 and edging out analysts’ expectations for $3.02 a share. Whirlpool said its decision to not engage in aggressive discounting has allowed it to expand margins in North America and Latin America, gains that helped it offset currency headwinds created by a stronger dollar and declining demand in key emerging markets – Brazil, Russia and China. Adjusted to exclude certain one-time costs, including a restructuring charge, earnings per share were $3.66, up from the $3.45 reported during the third-quarter of 2015 but falling short of the $3.85 analysts had expected.Whirlpool executives said they expected the weaker demand trend to be temporary, particularly in the US and UK as consumers on both sides of the Atlantic regain confidence in making big-ticket purchases after their respectively volatile campaign seasons. Still, the rebound likely won’t be immediate, Whirlpool said, leading it to lower the upper end of its full-year guidance to $11.50-$11.75, compared to the previous range of $11.50-$12.Although it can’t beat back currency headwinds, the company is hoping to fight back where it can, including in the US price wars, where the “intensity” of rivals’ promotions, particularly for washers, put Whirlpool on the back foot in the third quarter. Rather than race to the bottom, Whirlpool expects to raise prices for some items effective January 1 and increase its investment in new products. Also, the company is expecting a ruling in January on a lawsuit it has filed with the US Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission accusing competitors Samsung and LG of illegally dumping washers in the US.“You should expect more innovation from us, you should expect ongoing productivity from us, and again, as I said before, we believe in earning market share, not buying market share,” said chief executive Jeff Fettig.
20;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2016-03-16T15:39:28Z;Electrolux turns up the heat on smart appliances;Swedish manufacturer is transforming into a consumer-focused company;Connected appliances — ovens, washing machines and fridges that are hooked up to the internet — have long been trumpeted by companies. But they have generally failed to catch on with consumers, who have often seen them as expensive gimmicks.Now, though, Electrolux is now hoping to change all that — with an innovative cooker coming out this summer. It will have a camera inside the oven, to let you to monitor the Sunday roast from your mobile phone, and another app will even tell you when to cook each part of a dinner party menu, while ensuring the oven is always at the correct temperature.For the Swedish home appliance company — the world’s second-largest — the cooker is a small but crucial product launch. Electrolux is still smarting from having to abandon a deal to take over General Electric’s appliance business, following regulatory opposition. Many analysts had viewed that deal as “transformational”, and Electrolux had been hoping to use the takeover to attack its bigger US rival Whirlpool on its home turf. Instead, it gave up on the deal in December — losing its American-born chief executive, Keith McLoughlin, and some lustre with investors, in the process. Its shares have dropped by a fifth in the past year, more than Whirlpool and the wider Swedish market. Enter, in February, Jonas Samuelson as chief executive — a return to the tradition of naming a Swede as boss. And the former General Motors manager started by making a striking pledge: the decade-long restructuring by Electrolux is at an end. This had involved dozens of factory closures and thousands of job losses as production was shifted from developed countries to emerging markets. But senior managers say it was necessary for the company to survive in a hyper-competitive industry. Mr Samuelson is now hoping to use the cooker launch to speed up another change that Electrolux has long sought: it wants investors to stop viewing it as a manufacturer and instead see it as a consumer-focused company. He insists the shift is about more than PR. Most analysts cover Electrolux as a capital goods company but the Swedish group’s end-customers are individual consumers.Mr Samuelson argues that putting the consumer in charge is one of the three big trends in the industry. Digitalisation is the second, and connected appliances fit in with both of these themes. Mr Samuelson envisages a world where a washing machine can work out the best programme automatically so as not to damage clothes. But while this brings a certain opportunity, it also brings a competitive threat. Google, for example, is already present in the connected home with its Nest thermostats. Unusually for a company these days, Electrolux is banking on Europe providing the road map for how to succeed. Mr Samuelson’s main financial goal — an operating profit margin of 6 per cent — is only close to being achieved in its major appliance business in Europe. Electrolux managed a 5.8 per cent margin there last year, against 2.2 per cent for the group as a whole. Mr Samuelson himself was previously head of that European business and three other top executives — including the finance director — are drawn from the same ranks. Part of their success has been in focusing on specific consumer benefits — including, for instance, promoting steam ovens that offer customers juicier meat and better bread as well as higher growth and margins for Electrolux. But Mr Samuelson’s third big industry trend — the growing importance of emerging markets— highlights the challenge for Electrolux as much as the possibility. Brazil was for a long time the company’s best growth market. Electrolux quadrupled its market share there in the space of 15 years, and launched initiatives such as only introducing a new product if more than 70 per cent of consumers judged it better than the current best-seller. However, the country’s current economic funk meant Latin American sales and margins fell last year. China is even worse. Electrolux has been forced to all but withdraw from the market due to fierce local competition from groups such as Haier, which ended up buying GE’s appliance business. Electrolux is expected to return with a premium product strategy and seek local acquisitions. Mr Samuelson is having some early luck: lower commodity prices and an end to restructuring costs are providing a financial tailwind. But facing brutal competition from Whirlpool, Samsung, LG, Haier and Bosch Siemens, he will need more than an in-oven camera to win out. richard.milne@ft.com
21;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2015-09-01T16:38:52Z;Tussle for cooker group Aga as Whirlpool makes an approach;Board says it will recommend earlier bid from Middleby to avoid delay;Aga Rangemaster, the British manufacturer of upmarket cast-iron cookers, has found itself caught in a tug-of-war between two larger US kitchen equipment rivals.London-listed Aga said on Tuesday that it had received a last-minute approach for a possible cash offer from Whirlpool Corporation, the US white goods manufacturer.The bid for the maker of high-end cookers challenged an earlier offer that was close to completion. Illinois-based Middleby Corporation said in June that it was in talks to buy Aga with an offer that valued the company at £129m.The timing of the Whirlpool approach surprised market watchers, as Aga and Middleby had been expected to close the deal by the end of this month. One analyst, who asked not to be named, said that Whirlpool’s offer could carry a premium of roughly 10 per cent over the Middleby proposal.Aga has opened its books to Whirlpool. However its board on Tuesday said it continued to recommend the Middleby bid to shareholders “to avoid any delay to completion of that transaction”.The company added that a shareholder meeting would still be held on September 8 to consider the Middleby offer. A “put up or shut up” deadline is now awaited from the UK Takeover Panel, by which time Whirlpool must either make a firm offer or withdraw from the process.Matthew McEachran, analyst at N+1 Singer, said: “The relatively low offer from Middleby left the door open to a competing offer and Whirlpool have now come into the frame and have been granted time to do due diligence, one of a number of conditions to any offer being made.£129mValue of Middleby offer“If a bidding war breaks out there can be no saying where the upside may cap out at, but an increase from 185p certainly looks likely now. Another 50p would be a perfectly reasonable expectation for Whirlpool to kick things off.”Middleby’s offer of 185p per Aga share represented a premium of 77 per cent over the closing price of 104p on June 16, the last day before the offer period.Shares in Aga closed 14.6 per cent higher on Tuesday at 210p, giving it a market capitalisation of £145.5m. Its shares are up almost 40 per cent over the year.Warwickshire-based Aga benefited from a sales boost after May’s general election, as UK consumers showed more willingness to spend on luxury household goods.Revenues at the 175-year-old company, whose sales have historically been correlated to mortgage approvals, rose 1.5 per cent to £125.4m in the first half of the year as the housing market picked up and incomes rose.One-off costs of £3m associated with the planned sale to Middleby, as well as Aga’s big pension deficit relative to its valuation, weighed on the group’s half-year results. After agreeing terms with Middleby in July, Aga said a selling point of the deal was the support it would bring to the company’s pension scheme.£4mPre-tax loss Aga recorded in the six months to JuneAga reported a pre-tax loss of £4m for the six months to June, compared with a £300,000 loss in 2014. Operating profits were up 16.7 per cent to £2.8m.The UK group’s pension deficit stood at £46.7m as at June 30.Harry Philips, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said: “Profitability has been getting better over the last three years as they revamped the product range and made cost savings. The attraction for Middleby and Whirlpool is that they could take a very UK-centric brand and push it globally through their international networks.”Whirlpool and Middleby have market capitalisations of $12.8bn and $6bn, respectively.
22;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2015-09-01T16:18:21Z;Aga Rangemaster: marrying up;American bidders can offer more for the British brand;"A faded standard-bearer of the British rural aristocracy with bills to pay; a vulgar American with piles of money. From these components, many happy marriages have been made, on Downton Abbey and elsewhere.Aga Rangemaster — maker of the massive cast-iron stoves that adorn many a country kitchen in the Cotswolds — has two Yankee suitors. A £1.85-a-share bid from Middleby of Illinois, confirmed in July, puts a £129m price tag on Aga’s equity, a 77 per cent premium to the undisturbed price. Include the company’s modest net debt and its £47m pension deficit (which has dragged on the stock for years) and the deal value comes to £179m. Aga’s board has recommended the offer to shareholders and is moving ahead with it, without ruling out an approach from Whirlpool, announced on Tuesday. Aga is opening its books to the Michigan-based appliance maker.Aga shareholders have certainly suffered. Over a decade, total returns are negative, sales are flat and margins have fallen. Middleby and Whirlpool have enterprise values of $7bn and $16bn, respectively. Their strong balance sheets could eliminate the pension issue and put global distribution muscle behind Aga’s strong brand. Middleby owns Viking ranges, social signifiers in American homes in the same way that Agas are in Britain. Whirlpool is big worldwide.That is why Whirlpool could pay significantly more than Middleby has offered — and why Middleby could raise its bid. The premium looks big, but the analysts who cover the stock suggest that Aga could have £20m in earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) this year. So the Middleby offer amounts to 8.5 times ebitda, in line with Whirlpool and less than Middleby’s own share price rating. If the buyer can get Aga’s margins to pre-financial crisis levels and increase its sales outside the UK, £179m will turn out to have been a very low bid indeed. What could be better than a bidding war fought with crass American cash?Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
23;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2015-04-28T16:29:40Z;Investors sour on Coach turnround efforts;Benchmark S&P 500 index rises marginally;Investors soured on Coach despite its turnround efforts after the retailer reported fiscal third-quarter results that missed forecasts and as same-store sales fell more than expected.The New York-based company said same-store sales, a key industry metric that compares sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, declined 23 per cent in North America, worse than Wall Street forecasts for a 21.5 per cent decline.“A challenged North American women’s business reflects continued share loss in the domestic handbag market and we look for stabilisation in this part of the business as the key barometer of recovery to give us confidence that the story has inflected,” said Randall Konik, an equity analyst at Jefferies.Coach reported profits of $88.1m, or 32 cents a share, compared with $190.7m, or 69 cents a share, in the year ago period. Sales fell 15 per cent to $929.3m.Analysts had forecast earnings of 35 cents a share on sales of $950.6m. Adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share were modestly ahead of estimates.Shares of Coach, which have declined 20 per cent in the past year, fell 6 per cent to $39.65.Shares of The Container Store, the US retailer of storage items, fell 14 per cent to $18.61, after the company blamed severe winter weather and the stronger dollar for fourth-quarter results that missed Wall Street forecasts.The Texas-based company reported earnings of 27 cents a share on sales of $224.3m. Analysts had forecast earnings of 32 cents a share on sales of $233.8m.Comparable sales declined 0.8 per cent while Wall Street had forecast a gain of 2.9 per cent.The company said winter storms in February “during the vitally important last four days” of their Elfa shelving system sale and during the last days of the extension of the sale period impacted results.“Historically, approximately 20 per cent of our Elfa sale sales occur during those last four days and approximately 60 per cent of the sale extension sales occur in the final week,” said Kip Tindell, chief executive.$88.1min profits reported by coach, or 32 cents a share, compared with $190.7m or 69 cents a share a year ago“Additionally, a stronger US dollar had a significant impact on the conversion of our Elfa subsidiary sales.”Merck shares had their best day in over a year after the drugmaker fended off the adverse effect of a strong dollar that has dragged on US corporate earnings.Shares in the company advanced 5 per cent to $59.98 after the company reported better than expected first-quarter results and raised its full-year earnings guidance.First-quarter earnings per share of 85 cents beat analyst expectations of 74 cents while sales of $9.4bn were about $400m higher than the typical Wall Street estimate.Merck’s outperformance stands in sharp contrast to rival Pfizer, which cut its full-year guidance after it warned that a strengthening dollar was hurting its performance.Pfizer shares, which have lagged behind Merck’s, slipped 0.3 per cent to $34.48.The S&P 500 gained 0.3 per cent to 2,114.76, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 18,110.14 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 5,055.42.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
24;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2015-01-08T18:10:37Z;US export economy fails to import jobs;American businesses are now so efficient they require fewer workers;"This month, brace yourself to hear plenty of rhetoric coming out of Washington about “exports” and “jobs”. As a new Republican-dominated Congress starts work, energy companies are lobbying to drop a decades-old ban on exports of crude oil, arguing that such sales will create thousands of American jobs.As pitches go, it is a powerful one. But there is another question about exports and jobs that Congress should be debating more urgently: the fact that US businesses are becoming so efficient that they require fewer workers than ever before to deliver growth, even — or especially — for exports.Take a look at some fascinating data compiled by the Commerce Department, and quietly released last year. This shows that in the past few years, the number of American jobs supported by exports has risen as overseas sales have grown. In 2009, exports created 9.7m jobs; by 2013 the tally was 11.3m.This is cheering. And since overseas sales rose further in 2014, amid a wider economic recovery, there is every reason to think that when the commerce department publishes the 2014 tally the number of export-linked jobs will have grown again.But there is a billion dollar catch. Look at how many jobs are being generated per dollar of sales and the graph steadily slopes down. Back in 2009, each billion dollar’s worth of exports was creating 6,763 jobs. In 2013, it was 5,590 jobs. That is a fall of 17 per cent — in just four years.There are two ways to interpret this trend. If members of Congress want to feel cheery at the start of a new year, they could celebrate the fact that American companies are becoming more innovative and competitive on the world stage. This partly reflects lower energy costs. But another factor is that as recovery has taken hold in the US, levels of automation and digitisation are rising sharply too.That is prompting more US companies to develop production inside America, since it holds down labour costs. While Chinese workers might be cheaper than their American counterparts, robots are more cost effective than both — and often more competent.Take Alcoa, the world’s third-largest aluminium company. Having previously expanded production in places such as Mexico and Asia, it is now focusing heavily on the US. This winter, for example, it is remodelling a plant in Savannah, Georgia, that uses pioneering processes to forge metal to withstand ultra-high temperatures.A decade ago, such work might have been placed outside America. But Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa chief executive, says that it now makes sense to keep it in Savannah, to be closer to customers and research units. “The pressure to automate is huge,” he says. “We are not doing it for cost, but for innovation reasons . . . a precision is required that no human hand or eye can deliver.”Companies such as Whirlpool, General Electric and Ford are taking similar steps. Even clothing companies are doing the same. Levi Strauss, for example, still makes its jeans outside America. But it recently brought its innovation centre — and those jobs — from Turkey to San Francisco. Boston Consulting Group reckons that over half of all large US manufacturing companies are either actively re-shoring activity, or considering this, as America becomes a more competitive destination.There is a more pessimistic twist to all this: what will the surplus workers do? An optimistic answer is that the economy will eventually adapt to generate new jobs, as it did 150 years ago when farm workers were forced off the land. A downbeat scenario is that this trend will exacerbate the bifurcation that has developed in the jobs market in the past decade, as mid-tier manufacturing jobs have disappeared. In a world of hyper-efficient companies there is swelling demand for a highly trained elite; indeed, Thursday’s jobless claims data suggest that companies are actually finding it hard to hire enough skilled workers. Alcoa needs plenty of computer programmers. But what it does not need (as much) are traditional metal-bashers. Exports can boom — but with fewer blue-collar workers.Mr Kleinfeld has recently started working with community colleges on retraining programmes, in a bid to help workers to adapt. Other companies are doing the same. But what is lamentably missing is any coherent policy from Washington to support such endeavour. Indeed, Congress seems to be paying woefully little attention to the issue, compared with the focus it is devoting to other topics, such as those energy exports. That needs to change — well before the current recovery loses steam.gillian.tett@ft.com"

Revenues climbed 6 per cent to $5.03bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.85 a share on sales of $4.96bn.

26;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2014-09-07T15:46:22Z;Few US ‘reshorings’ go ahead, study finds;;"“Relatively few” of companies’ announced “reshorings” of manufacturing to the US have actually gone ahead and the trend’s effect on employment has been a “drop in the bucket,” research by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology academic suggests.The work, by Jim Rice, deputy director of MIT’s Center for Transportation and Logistics, throws into doubt expectations that the US economy might enjoy significant growth in manufacturing employment through job repatriation.However, Mr Rice told the Financial Times that some manufacturing had returned to the US as companies moved production from single large centres in China to smaller plants closer to the world’s main consumer countries.“If you look at the number of people they’re employing, it’s probably going to be a drop in the bucket when you compare it to overall employment,” Mr Rice said.The preliminary results of Mr Rice’s research – conducted with Francesco Stefanelli, a visiting researcher – suggested that many companies that had said they would repatriate jobs to the US had not actually done so.The research probed the reality behind announcements by about 50 companies – including General Electric, Apple, Whirlpool and Caterpillar – to be moving jobs back from overseas to the US.“In the majority of cases, the companies involved plan to invest in US-based production capacity; they have not actually made the move,” an article containing the findings reads. “The data indicate that there are relatively few published instances of reshoring.”Mr Rice did not say which companies had announced reshoring but not gone ahead, but an article on the early results says technology companies have been particularly prone to the practice.Even among reshoring projects that had gone ahead, Mr Rice said, some had produced only modest employment growth. One widely touted case – the return of some manufacturing of Wham-O Frisbees to California – had led to the setting up of a factory employing eight people.Among the highest-profile announced reshoring projects, GE in 2012 invested $1bn in moving some of its domestic appliance production for the US market back from Mexico and China to the US. Both Apple and Google have moved some electronics production back from Asia to the US.Mr Rice said some companies had moved production back to the US because of narrowing wage differentials with China and concerns over the security of long supply chains. However, he said that reflected an apparent trend away from concentrating manufacturing in one low labour-cost country and distributing it to centres worldwide to cut down on travel time and cost.“Transportation costs vary significantly by the type of product,” Mr Rice said. “If you’re talking about electronics, it’s going to be a different story from someone making furniture.”The researchers had also monitored for cases where US manufacturers moved more production to China from the US but were not yet able to say whether such moves were still under way and on what scale.“There’s always movement,” Mr Rice said. “It’s a sea change. The waves are going to keep coming, but we don’t know how big or how fast.”"
27;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2014-07-11T16:40:31Z;Whirlpool buys 60% of Indesit for €758m;;Whirlpool has bought a controlling stake in white goods maker Indesit, the latest example of a prominent Italian industrial family selling up as Italy’s decade-long economic decline takes its toll.Whirlpool of the US beat offers from Turkish and Chinese investors to take a 60 per cent stake in the company, known for its Indesit, Hotpoint and Scholtes brand, for €758m.It marks the exit of Indesit’s founding Merloni family – one of Italy’s most prominent industrial dynasties – and comes after sales plunged during the eurozone crisis and a deep recession in Italy.The sale is the latest foreign takeover among Italy’s best known brands. Luxury groups Loro Piana, Bulgari, Valentino, Brioni, Poltrona Frau and Pomellato and consumer groups Parmalat, Ducati, Marazzi and Bertolli have been sold in the past five years.Bankers say more deals are in the pipeline as foreign buyers, from the US to China, see an opportunity to pick up strong brands from mostly family-owned businesses where entrepreneurs are often struggling with succession issues, the pressure of globalisation and cash-strapped Italian consumers buying less.Coldiretti, an Italian business lobby, estimated that, in 2014, about €2bn of acquisitions had been made, mostly of small and midsized consumer goods groups in food, fashion and machinery.“The deal announced today is aimed at providing Indesit with all the means necessary for it to create a solid and sustainable future,” said Gian Oddone Merli, chief executive of Fineldo, the Merloni family’s holding company.Indesit was founded in the 1930s by Aristide Merloni, a small town entrepreneur from the Marche region in central Italy. In the postwar years, his son Vittorio expanded the group internationally, becoming a world leader in washing machines, fridges and dishwashers and competing with Bosch and Electrolux.However, in the past decade, Indesit has struggled with the rise of cheaper manufacturers from China and succession of its third generation after the retirement of Mr Merloni, who is in his 80s. It hired Goldman Sachs this year to look for buyers.Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, said it would use the deal “to position our European business for growth and ongoing value creation” as it seeks to expand further beyond its home market. The deal must clear a number of regulatory and antitrust reviews before closing.Giuseppe di Taranto, a professor at Luiss university in Rome, said Italy’s weak economy could be largely blamed for Italian companies being the acquired rather than the acquirer.“The result of the crisis is that companies from richer countries are shopping in poorer countries, and Italy is one of those poorer countries,” he said.Italy’s economy shrank 0.1 per cent in the first quarter after emerging from a two-year recession at the end of last year. Recent weak data has added to concerns that the economy might have shrunk or shown only feeble growth in the second quarter.Additional reporting by Neil Munshi in Milwaukee
28;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2014-04-25T17:45:14Z;Whirlpool and Electrolux see growth ahead;;Whirlpool and Electrolux, the world’s two largest makers of home appliances, said a modest US housing recovery and the slow improvement of the European economy would continue as sales ticked up in key markets.Shares in Electrolux soared 10 per cent after the Stockholm-based company said it expected European demand to increase 1 to 3 per cent instead of 0 to 2 per cent. Europe accounts for a third of its revenues, and the drop in consumer demand that followed the economic crisis has weighed heavily on the company.“Following a long period of market decline, European demand for appliances improved during the first quarter of 2014,” said Keith McLoughlin, Electrolux’s chief executive. “The market has stabilised and demand increased in several major markets, such as Germany, France and Italy.”Underlying operating profits in the first quarter rose modestly from a year earlier to SKr749m ($114m) but were a third ahead of analysts’ consensus estimates according to Reuters.Shares in Whirlpool fell nearly 2 per cent in early New York trading after the company reported earnings of $2.20 a share in the first three months of the year, missing analysts’ expectations of $2.33.Sales at the Michigan-based company, which sells home appliances under Maytag, Jenn-Air, KitchenAid and its own name, grew nearly 3 per cent to $4.36bn, driven by a more than 4 per cent rise in North American sales.Jeff Fettig, chief executive, told analysts on a call following the results that US sales growth had started slowly amid harsh winter weather but accelerated over the course of the quarter. He said he was confident in demand increasing 5 to 7 per cent, compared with a 4 per cent increase forecast by Electrolux.“We expect growth in US housing for the full year, increased demand to recycle appliances and [increased] discretionary demand,” he said.Brian Sozzi, chief executive of Belus Capital Advisors, said the company may be overplaying the US housing recovery and was concerned about how Whirlpool had increased marketing spending during the quarter.“New and existing home sales have slowed going on eight months but Whirlpool increasing marketing in the US is a signal to me they’re having some resistance” to price increases, he said.Whirlpool said it expects industry-wide sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region to be flat to up 2 per cent this year.Both companies saw sales fall in Asia, but stressed the importance of continued investment in the region for future growth. Electrolux has launched a new product line in China, while Whirlpool is in the process of completing its purchase of a 51 per cent stake in Chinese appliance maker Hefei Sanyo for about $552m, pending regulatory approval.
29;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2013-11-11T19:17:15Z;US retail: wait for a sale;Retail stocks are not expensive, but they are still not cheap enough;In an overheated stock market, US retailers are beginning to look like a bargain. Walmart, Target, Macy’s and Nordstrom have underperformed the wider market so far this year. Their valuations, measured in terms of price/earnings ratios, have not broken out of their historical ranges, as stocks in many sectors have. The unexpectedly strong October jobs report seems a good sign for holiday shopping. Consumer balance sheets do, too: debt payments as a percentage of disposable income are at a multi-decade low, according to Federal Reserve data.Time for investors to go shopping?No, for several reasons. Instead of clothes and impulse purchases, shoppers are spending on lasting items such as cars (in October, US auto sales were up 10 per cent) and appliances (Whirlpool reported North American unit sales up 11 per cent in its third quarter) for their recently refinanced homes. In the last reported quarter, Macy’s posted a decline in comparable store sales and its profits missed expectations. Walmart’s numbers were unimpressive too. Both companies cut their sales and earnings goals.The jobs number, impressive as it was, coincided with bad news on consumer confidence. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell for the fourth straight month in November and hit its lowest level in nearly two years. Finally, a late Thanksgiving holiday this year combined with an early Hanukkah will condense the peak shopping period. That means more promotions early on. Morgan Stanley is forecasting the worst holiday season retail sales growth results since 2008.While retail stocks are not expensive, they are not cheap enough, in the absence of evidence that consumers have begun to loosen the purse strings. Better to wait until the holidays are over, then hit the sales.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The news sent Netflix shares up 10 per cent in after-market trading, with the company opening the morning well into positive territory.However, shares sank quickly in the first 90 minutes of trading and closed 9.2 per cent lower to $339.10, after Bank of America issued a note that said the elevated stock price was “difficult to justify”.The streaming television provider is up just less than 400 per cent in the past 12 months and has a price-to-earnings ratio of 186. By contrast, the S&P 500 has a p/e ratio of 16.8.The day’s broad rally helped the Nasdaq Composite index to shake off the decline by Netflix to add 0.2 per cent to 3,929.57.The S&P 500 gained 0.6 per cent to a record close of 1,754.67 and touched a fresh intraday record high of 1,759.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 15,467.66.A busy day of earnings also helped drive some companies higher as investors look to balance sheets for justification of higher share prices.Whirlpool shares rose after it reported earnings per share of $2.72 that soundly beat estimates and revenue that grew 4.2 per cent.Investors drove Whirlpool shares 11.6 per cent higher to $146.14.Lockheed Martin showed its ability to shake off US budget cuts, as it announced that it had raised its full-year 2013 earnings per share projections to $9.20-$9.50 and that third-quarter net earnings were up 20 per cent.Lockheed shares moved 3.8 per cent higher to $130.05.Cloud software company VMware reported on Monday after the market close that third-quarter earnings per share beat estimates, and a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $1.29bn that met expectations.VMware shares were up 2.8 per cent to $85.00.Delta Air Lines gained 3.2 per cent to $25.49 after it reported earnings that also beat earnings per share predictions and a revenue increase in line with estimates.Coach benefited from a quarterly earnings report that was little improved from the previous year, but did beat estimates with earnings per share of $0.77. However, investors were unimpressed, sending shares down 8.2 per cent to $49.75.Apple shares, which have rallied 9.1 per cent in October back above the $500 level, took a step back on Tuesday. The iPhone maker was off 0.3 per cent to $519.87 despite the company’s event that included the announcement a the new iPad Air model.The broader market moves followed the delayed release of September’s non-farm payrolls data, which showed the US had added a less-than-expected 148,000 jobs. The downbeat news helped reinforce investor belief that the Federal Reserve would not begin to taper its quantitative easing programme in the near future.The jobs report sent 10-year Treasury yields to a three-month low, which helped utilities stocks, with the sector up 1.3 per cent. Utilities, which tend to have stable share prices and high dividends, perform particularly well when interest rates remain low.Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said the rally was a continuation from September, when the market began the month with 11 positive days in 12 sessions.“This is a market that has picked up from September and kind of veered off during the shutdown and debt ceiling debate. It’s picking up from where it left off when Ben Bernanke said no taper,” she said. “It’s one of the most accommodative periods in the calendar for equity markets. In addition to that, you’ve got the credit markets helping to set the stage for the market moving higher.”While continued faith in the Fed’s liquidity programme was driving the market higher, Ms Krosby noted that investors were taking profits in some of the year’s biggest gainers and piling into businesses that demonstrated revenue growth.“You have a number of companies, important companies, coming out with better earnings and some actually coming out with better top-line revenue growth. Mind you, not all of them. We’d like to see more, but it’s been enough to give the market this push higher.”
31;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2013-10-22T17:42:53Z;Jobs and earnings: multiple choice;There are some US stocks that are worth owning;"The great and terrifying thing about market analysis is that there is always more data. Unsatisfied with one source? Add another. Still, it is tricky to ignore the US jobs report, which sputtered out its September reading on Tuesday. Even allowing that the report is noisy, a slowing trend is evident. On a three-month rolling average, the US is adding 140,000 jobs a month; six months ago the rate was more than 200,000.If jobs growth is weakening, though, some companies are managing to do well – and not just innovative companies, such as Netflix, which take share in sluggish markets. Tuesday brought strong earnings reports from two companies in mature, competitive industries that are sensitive to consumer spending. Delta Air Lines saw passenger miles grow slightly and revenue per mile tick up; total passenger revenue was up 7 per cent as a result. Whirlpool’s appliances sales in North America rose 11 per cent on a unit basis. Shares of the companies – which do not look terribly expensive – popped.So certain stocks are worth owning, despite a long rally and slowing GDP growth. In aggregate, however, company performance confirms the jobs report. Net margins on S&P 500 companies may touch their 2006 record of 9.6 per cent this quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. This has protected earnings growth. However, sales at S&P 500 companies are unlikely to grow at all between the second and third quarters.Stock pickers will find opportunities in companies such as Delta and Whirlpool. Bulls on stocks generally must believe one of three things: (a) margins can exceed record levels (b) sales growth will pick up, despite what the jobs report suggests, or (c) monetary policy can keep stock valuations expanding indefinitely. Sceptics will keep checking box (d), none of the above, despite recent experience.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
32;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2013-10-22T16:23:08Z;Whirlpool buoyed by US housing recovery;;Shares in Whirlpool surged more than 11 per cent as the US appliance maker raised its full-year earnings forecast after its third-quarter profit more than doubled, buoyed by the US housing recovery.“We continue to see positive trends in US housing, the normal replacement cycle of appliances, and a return of discretionary purchases to the market,” Jeff Fettig, chief executive, told analysts on Tuesday.The Michigan-based company raised its full-year outlook to $9.90 to $10.10 a share, excluding items, compared with its earlier estimate of $9.50 to $10.00.Whirlpool reported earnings of $196m, or $2.42 a share, in the three months to September compared with $74m, or 94 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Excluding tax credits, restructuring costs and other one-off items, it reported earnings of $2.72 a share, compared with $1.80 last year. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $2.60 a share.The company, which has embarked on a cost-cutting drive this year, said sales rose 4 per cent to $4.68bn, from $4.49bn, missing expectations of $4.74bn.North American revenues climbed 8 per cent, to $2.6bn, driven largely by higher volumes in the US, where sales rose 10 per cent year on year. The company said gains in the region were offset by weakness in Mexico and currency impact in Canada.Sales from Europe, the Middle East and Asia increased 5 per cent, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, to $778m.
33;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2013-10-14T22:19:03Z;Washington optimism puts S&P above 1,700;;Optimism on Wall Street over negotiations in Washington drove stocks higher for a fourth consecutive day as consumer discretionary stocks overcame a morning swoon to help the S&P close back above the 1,700 level.The consumer discretionary sector added 0.3 per cent, led by streaming entertainment service Netflix, which gained 7.8 per cent to $324.36.Reports emerged on Monday that the company was in discussions to offer its service as an app in cable television set-top boxes, potentially opening it to a new customer base.After stocks opened lower on little news of progress from Washington over the weekend, indices rose steadily from late morning until the end of the day’s trading. Eight of the 10 major sectors of the S&P500 closed in positive territory, with the benchmark index 0.4 per cent higher to 1,710.15.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.4 per cent to 15,301.26, and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.6 per cent to 3,815.28.A strong rally to end the previous week was spurred by news that politicians in Washington had initiated substantive talks to avoid an forthcoming default on US debt and reopen the government.However, it was not all smooth sailing for consumer stocks, as appliance manufacturer Whirlpool fell 6.5 per cent to $131.29. That fall helped make consumer durables and clothing stocks one of the worst industry areas on the S&P500, off 0.2 per cent.Weakness in housebuilder stocks also hit the group, with DR Horton off 2.1 per cent to $18.05, PulteGroup down 0.7 per cent to $15.99 and Lennar 1.5 per cent lower at $34.31.Expedia lost 6.2 per cent to $48.51 after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the company’s stock to “hold” from “buy”.Utilities stocks were also among the hardest hit with the sector off 0.6 per cent.Duke Energy fell 0.4 per cent to $68.58, Exelon dropped 1.1 per cent to $30.02, and PPL Corporation lost 1.1 per cent to $30.16.Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology recovered from a drop on Friday after a poor earnings report to add 1.4 per cent to $17.07.The company is now down 7.4 per cent since the open of trading last Friday but remains up 169 per cent on the year to date.Also boosting the semiconductor industry was Advanced Micro Devices, which gained 3.7 per cent to $3.97 on an upgrade from Wedbush to “outperform” from “neutral”.Drugmaker Merck was sent lower by a pair of downgrades on its shares.Bernstein slashed Merck’s shares to “market perform” from “outperform” and Barclays went to “equalweight” from “overweight”. Merck shares were down 1.1 per cent to $46.75.The CBOE Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the Vix, continued its recent wavering, rising as high as 17.8 before closing at 16.1. The Vix broke through the 21 level last week but has fallen steadily as shares have recovered and chances of a deal in Washington continues to increase.Despite the recent uptick in volatility, indices are trading at about the slightly higher since the beginning of the previous week. Since Monday, the S&P500 is up 1.2 per cent while the Nasdaq is 0.2 per cent higher.But as the earnings season is just ramping up for US companies, investors will be weighing the risks of a continued impasse in Washington with crucial reports about the ability for companies to justify share prices that remain near record highs.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said in a note that poor earnings combined with political risk could create an environment in which investors rapidly abandon equities.“As we saw the last time we had debt-ceiling issues in August 2011, bad news can turn into about a 20 per cent drop in three weeks,” he said. “One big concern is margin debt, which is near all-time highs. This isn’t bearish by itself but a big move lower in the SPX could lead to margin calls and a cascade of selling.”
34;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2013-08-13T13:02:55Z;Whirlpool to buy Hefei Sanyo stake in effort for China foothold;;Whirlpool of the US has agreed on a $552m proposal to take control of a Chinese maker of fridges and washing machines as it tries to gain a better foothold in the fast-growing consumer markets of Asia.The agreement, which was revealed by the FT in May, will see the US group buy out a stake in Hefei Sanyo that is owned by Panasonic of Japan and simultaneously inject more than $330m of cash for new shares.The growth in sales of white goods in China has been increasing at more than 10 per cent a year for the past decade, according to industry estimates, although sales have been supported by government subsidies, especially among rural households.Whirlpool is determined to expand in emerging markets, especially Asia where it made just 5 per cent of its $18bn sales last year, up from 3 per cent in 2008. More than half of its sales are still in North America, but Latin America has grown to account for about a quarter.“Whirlpool has a strong presence in China’s higher tier segments, this acquisition allows the company to build on, complement, and grow its position in the emerging Chinese market,” said Jeff Fettig, chief executive of Michigan-based Whirlpool.Hefei Sanyo, which was started as a joint venture between Sanyo and the local government in 1994, is currently 33.5 per cent owned by the local government in the province of Anhui, whose capital is Hefei. Panasonic owns 29.5 per cent and the remainder is held by private shareholders through the company’s listing on the Shanghai stock market.With the new shares being sold to Whirpool as part of the agreement to give it 51 per cent of the enlarged capital base, public shareholders will be diluted to a stake of 25.8 per cent of Hefei Sanyo and the local government’s stake will fall to 23.5 per cent.
35;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2013-05-24T12:04:58Z;Whirlpool in talks to buy 30% Sanyo stake from Panasonic;;Whirlpool of the US is in talks to buy a 30 per cent stake in a Chinese maker of fridges and washing machines from Panasonic of Japan, as it looks to gain a leg-up in China’s fast growing white-goods markets.Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric, which is listed in Shanghai with a market value of Rmb5.3bn ($864m), would almost double Whirlpool’s share of China’s washing machine sales, though it remains some way behind market leaders Haier, Midea and Little Swan.Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, is determined to expand in emerging markets, especially Asia where it made just 5 per cent of its $18bn sales last year, up from 3 per cent in 2008. More than half of its sales are still in North America, but Latin America has grown to account for about a quarter.Hefei Sanyo, which also makes fridges and microwave ovens, but with tiny share in those markets, is nearly 34 per cent held by Hefei State-Owned Assets Holding, an investment fund of the government of Anhui province, of which Hefei is the capital city.The provincial government is very supportive of an agreement, according to people familiar with the talks, in part because Whirlpool is prepared to make Hefei the centre of its north Asian operations. It is currently based in Shanghai.Once Whirlpool concluded a deal for Panasonic’s stake in Hefei Sanyo, it would first aim to take some or all of the local government’s stake and after then look to buy any more shares needed in the secondary market to give it complete control, according to one person.The talks have been going on for several weeks already. After officers from Whirlpool made a number of visits to Hefei Sanyo’s facilities in April, rumours of the talks led to a sudden run-up in the Chinese company’s stock, according to one person with knowledge of the talks.The shares lept almost 24 per cent in a fortnight and the company asked for them to be suspended on May 13.Panasonic in China declined to comment on the talks, saying only that an announcement would be made in time, while the Hefei State-Owned Assets Holding also declined to comment. The secretary of the chairman of Hefei Sanyo said it was a matter for the shareholders.Whirlpool declined to comment.Hefei Sanyo, which was started as a joint venture between Sanyo and the local government in 1994, has the right to use the Sanyo brand until 2017, but has also been promoting its own high-end brands, Diqua and RoyalStar, in the past couple of years and wants further support to do that.The company reported Rmb4bn in sales last year and almost Rmb350m in pre-tax profits, according to Bloomberg data.Panasonic bought Sanyo in 2009 and has since sold a number of businesses, including selling all its non-Japan and China white-goods operations to Haier of China.Additional reporting by Li Wan in Beijing, Ben McLannahan in Tokyo and Neil Munshi in Chicago
36;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2012-12-18T19:45:17Z;Whirlpool – spin cycle ends;Nasty price competition is due for a return;It is all coming out in the wash for Whirlpool investors. After a brutal 2011, the US appliance maker’s shares have returned 119 per cent so far in 2012, fourth-best in the S&P 500. The shares, at $101, are not far off their pre-crisis peaks of 2007. In an industry known for its cyclicality, can the run continue?Whirlpool’s operating performance has been transformed over the past year by rapid widening of profit margins in its home market. Last autumn, the company reported that in North America (a region which accounts for more than half of sales) third-quarter revenues declined slightly and operating margins dropped to 2.6 per cent. In this year’s third quarter, sales grew – albeit at a merely inflationary pace – but margins exploded, passing 9 per cent. The company credited pricing, mix and capacity cuts initiated in 2011. Whirlpool’s second-most important region, Latin America, produced not even half as much profit Asia barely contributed and Europe made a loss.Whirlpool expects more than $7 in adjusted earnings per share for 2012, up from $2 in 2011. The expectations of Wall Street analysts for next year’s EPS have hit $9. The stock trades at 11 times that number, which appears reasonable – if the current level of North American profitability can be sustained. But that would be surprising.To put the current margins in perspective, in the third quarter of the boom year 2007, when North American sales were a fifth higher than today, margins were only slightly more than 5 per cent. Yes, Whirlpool’s Swedish peer Electrolux has also done well in North America, with margins hitting 6.7 per cent in the most recent quarter, up from 1.5 a year before. But the nasty price competition that has long characterised the industry will reassert itself soon enough. Whirlpool’s spin cycle is coming to an end.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
37;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2012-07-19T16:04:16Z;Price rises lift profits at Electrolux;;Electrolux, the world’s second-largest maker of home appliances by revenue, reaped the rewards again of pushing through price rises to consumers as it unveiled better-than-expected second-quarter profits.After a difficult 2011 for white goods manufacturers with large increases in raw material prices, this year is turning into a better vintage with Electrolux reporting a rise of 15 per cent in sales, 54 per cent in operating profits and 151 per cent in operating cash flow compared with a year earlier.The Swedish company, a close rival to the bigger Whirlpool of the US which reports results next week, enjoyed strong sales in Latin America and Asia and also boosted market share in Europe. Operating margins rose to 4.1 per cent from 3.1 per cent a year earlier, while they surged to 6 per cent in the US from 1.8 per cent.Keith McLoughlin, chief executive, said the second half was likely to be even better despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. “This year is a tough year. There is no tailwind. You have to slog through it every week, every month, every quarter. It is going to take a while for the more mature markets to get on a more steady footing and emerging market growth is moderating somewhat,” he told the Financial Times.Europe was in a recession and would probably get worse in the near term but the rest of the world should escape a sharp slowdown, he added.Shares in Electrolux, which also has brands such as AEG and Frigidaire, rose 6.4 per cent to SKr154.Operating profit in the second quarter was SKr1.15bn, up from SKr745m a year earlier, on sales of SKr27.8bn, up from SKr24.1bn.Electrolux and Whirlpool forced through a series of price rises at the end of last year and start of 2012. But Mr McLoughlin said Electrolux had not done so since February. Falling commodities prices meant that there could be a boost to profits next year from raw materials but a hit of up to SKr500m this year. About SKr300m already came in the first half.“Pushing through price increases to big retail customers is probably one of the hardest things you can do in business, particularly in a weak economic environment. But at some point they have to make their way through to the consumer otherwise somebody is going out of business,” he said.

The company argued that Korean manufacturers have benefited from unfair government subsidies.The US plans to impose retaliatory duties of up to 71 per cent on large residential washing machines made by Daewoo Electronics as the company refused to respond to the US investigation. Samsung and LG Electronics were told to pay 1.2 per cent and 0.22 per cent respectively on their portions of $569m in annual imports from South Korea.The proposal, although it is still preliminary, came as a relief to Whirlpool, which has continued to lose market share to its Asian competitors in recent years. Whirlpool is pleased “given the proven record that South Korean appliance producers have benefited from their government’s subsidies that violate trade law,” said the company.However, the lower-than-expected level of punitive duties was also welcomed by Samsung and LG. Samsung, the world’s largest technology company by sales, said it “is in compliance with US trade laws. We will continue to meet the demand from US consumers for our superior washing machines.” LG also said it is “gratified” with the preliminary decision, calling it a “victory” for the company.Once the Commerce Department makes a final decision next month, the duties can take effect if the US International Trade Commission decides the imports threaten to cause material injury to US producers. But the ITC may not back the Commerce Department’s proposal. Last month, the US trade panel rejected the Commerce Department’s proposal to impose both countervailing and anti-dumping duties on refrigerators made by Samsung and LG, saying that the imports did not pose a threat to Whirlpool’s business.Even if the initial duties go into effect, that is unlikely to have any major impact on the Korean companies’ sales of washing machines in the US. “We are glad that we can continue to sell our washers in the US with an absolutely minimum level of duties,” said an LG spokesman. He denied that LG was selling its washers at below production costs, saying its US sales of washing machines were “highly profitable.” LG has been the number one seller of front-loading washing machines in the US for the past five years with around 20 per cent of market share. Front-loadings models are more expensive than top-loading washers.Korean companies see Whirlpool’s complaint as a move to defend its home market from growing competition from them as their home appliances gain increasing popularity worldwide. According to market researcher NPD, Samsung was the biggest seller of double-door refrigerators with a 33 per cent global market share, followed by LG’s 26.4 per cent and Whirlpool’s 12.3 per cent.The level of preliminary duties for Daewoo seems extremely high but Daewoo said it has not responded to the US investigation because its washer exports to the US are “minimal.” Its US market share of washing machines remains below 0.1 per cent and the US market takes up less than 0.3 per cent of its total sales of washing machines, the company said. “We don’t understand how this small volume can affect Whirlpool,” said the company.With the electronics industry suffering from higher raw material costs and weak consumer demand, Whirlpool expects only limited growth of 0-3 per cent in appliance shipments this year in North America. On the back of the countervailing duties, Whirlpool hopes to push back against its Asian rivals but the duties are not expected to help Whirlpool defend its US market share much, unless it comes up with competitive products to win US consumers’ hearts.Related reading:

Sweden’s Ikea and China’s TCL Multimedia have come up with an answer, furniture with built-in appliances.This is not Ikea’s first ever foray into electricals – having produced some white goods before in cooperation with Whirlpool and Electrolux. But the new venture, called UPPLEVA, is the first move into entertainment gadgetry, like stereo systems and flat-screen TV sets.For TCL, the deal with Ikea is being billed as a chance to alter global perceptions.“This new partnership will not only enable TCL to explore a potential business opportunity, but will also enhance TCL’s brand awareness in the overseas markets”, said Li Dongsheng, TCL chairman, in the press release announcing the agreement.Ikea has said that the new range will be launched in June, in Sweden, Poland, France, Germany and Italy, with other European countries joining the list in the following months.Last year TCL was one of three Chinese companies to place its products in summer blockbuster film Transformers 3. More recently, it was given the contract to replace Toshiba’s giant screens at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People.TCL, is already big at home, where it has the 3rd largest market share of LCD TVs, and is 2nd in TV sets overall.However globally TCL still lags behind rivals, taking less than 5 per cent of the LCD market. Getting in with the world’s largest manufacturer of furniture might help raise the company’s profile abroad, provided the products are up to scratch. But whether anyone will want to fork out almost $1,000 for the cheapest UPPLEVA built-in TV cabinets is another thing.
40;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2012-02-03T23:12:45Z;Positive employment data lift US stocks;;A week that started with eurozone clouds over Wall Street ended with the focus squarely back on the domestic economy, as a strong employment report gave another leg to the new year rally.Stocks had opened sharply lower on Monday as a eurozone summit once again weighed on sentiment, but the market rallied through the rest of the week, before a fall in unemployment to 8.3 per cent, a three-year low, pushed markets sharply higher on Friday.Equity strategists had been worrying that the “surprise” ratio of US data – a measure of how often domestic economic reports surprise to the upside, boosting stocks – had started to tail off, but bulls seized on the employment report to advance the argument that US markets can decouple from their eurozone peers.“Our economy is growing, and faster than we thought. That reduces the dependence of US equity markets on eurozone news flow,” said Randy Warren, principal of money manager Warren Financial, who said he was adding to his domestic equity position in anticipation of further rallies in the S&P 500.The S&P 500 ended the week up 2.2 per cent, at 1,344.9, 25 points into bull market territory and at a new six-month high.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index hit a post-dot com bubble high after climbing 3.2 per cent to 2,905.66, as Facebook’s long-awaited IPO filing drove a two-day rally in internet stocks from Chinese social network Renren to offers website Groupon.Zynga benefited the most. Shares in the social-game developer climbed 33.2 per cent over the week to $13.39, trading comfortably above its $10 IPO price for the first time since its stock market debut in December last year.That came after Facebook’s filing showed Zynga accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook’s 2011 revenue, up from 10 per cent in the prior two years. But other moves appeared to have little to do with any Facebook-specific information.Professional networking website LinkedIn climbed 4.3 per cent over the week to $79.88, Groupon surged 21.9 per cent to $24.43, well above its November $20 IPO price. Chinese internet businesses, including SINA, which owns a Twitter-like service and gained 7.2 per cent to $75.00, also benefited.“There’s nothing I saw in the Facebook filing that justifies a 20 per cent rally for Groupon or LinkedIn say,” warned Aaron Kessler at Raymond, “this is clearly all about sentiment, which makes the stocks vulnerable to a pull back if say earnings were to disappoint.”Options traders appeared to be taking note, with bearish traders buying $18 Groupon puts in large volumes on Friday, a trade that would require the stocks to pare gains significantly in the next two weeks to yield a profit.The tussle between eurozone tail risk and upbeat US economic data was summed up in a 17 per cent rise for Genworth Financial, which ended the week at a post-July close of $9.17.The market capitalisation of the US insurer halved in 2011 on fears of a deep recession in the eurozone, where it sells a consumer debt insurance product.The company declared its first quarterly profit since 2010, after a sharp fall in losses on its core domestic mortgage insurance products, as the default rate on its US mortgage book fell.“Sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth we’d expect to see a seasonal uptick in delinquencies,” said Steven Schwartz at Raymond James. “That we didn’t may indicate that we’ve reached a peak default rate for Genworth’s mortgage book, and will see falls form here.”Bank stocks rallied strongly through the week, with Morgan Stanley, whose shares climbed 9.4 per cent to $20.31 over the week, to the fore as the investment bank secured the coveted lead underwriting role for Facebook’s IPO.Bank of America hit a post-August high of $7.89 before ending the week up 7.5 per cent at $7.84, although the bank is still only trading at 40 per cent of the book value of its assets.The New York Stock Exchange fell 0.3 per cent to $27.49 in the week that the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse. Rival CME Group saw its shares climb 14.2 per cent to $273.43.Earnings were the other big driver of stocks during the week. Amazon shares fell 3.9 per cent over the week to $187.68, as revenue and sales growth fell unexpectedly at the online retailer.Whirlpool surged 25.8 per cent to $68.66 for the best performance in the S&P 500, as the dishwasher manufacturer delivered unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter results, after substantial cost savings.
41;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2012-02-02T22:55:06Z;Electrolux sees weak demand in Europe and US;;Demand for appliances in developed countries will remain sluggish this year, according to Keith McLoughlin, chief executive of Electrolux, as the Swedish white goods producer reported a 65 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits.The world’s second-largest home appliance maker after Whirlpool said that the European market will continue to shrink, while the growth in US demand for appliances would be “slightly positive” at best.Mr McLoughlin added that demand from Latin America and Asia would remain robust, and that margins would likely be helped over the next 12 months by better commodity prices, which are “going in the right direction”.Electrolux reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from SKr925m ($137m) to SKr328m in the final three months of the year due to the twin effects of higher raw material costs and sluggish demand.Full-year profits fell 48 per cent to SKr2.8bn, which was worse than analysts had expected. Margins plunged 2.3 percentage points to 2.7 per cent and earnings per share fell 48 per cent to SKr14 over the year.But revenues rose 3 per cent to SKr28.4bn in the fourth quarter, helped by the acquisition last year of CTI, the Chile-based home appliance company, and Olympic Group, the biggest appliance maker in the Middle East and north Africa.Mr McLoughlin said the company will continue to expand into emerging markets, focusing particularly on areas “where there is a burgeoning middle class”.Electrolux will also attempt to make the most of any gains in America due to an expected pick-up in the housing market by “bringing out more cool products faster”, he said, adding that raising prices will also be a key strategy.Over the past few years, Electrolux and its peers have attempted to raise prices and cut costs to combat higher costs for raw materials and weak consumer demand.Rival Whirlpool on Thursday forecast “significantly improved” earnings in 2012, saying that its efforts to boost prices and cut costs were already beginning to show results.Whirlpool generates about half of its revenue from the US, where the market is showing glimmers of hope, while Electrolux generates only 27 of revenue from the same region. Electrolux is also more exposed to the beleaguered European markets than its larger rival.Electrolux announced last year that it was implementing price increases across Europe by 5 to 7 per cent but did not give any details on price increases for 2012. Analysts said that weak demand could make it difficult for the company to push through price rises.The company also has plans to cut annual costs by SKr5.3bn by 2015-16 from closing plants in North America and Europe as well as reducing staffing and overhead costs in all regions.The final dividend for Electrolux was kept unchanged at SKr6.50 a share. Shares in Electrolux rose 2 per cent to SKr132.70 on Thursday.
42;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2012-02-01T21:35:13Z;US stocks rebound on solid manufacturing data;S&P 500 back in bull market territory;Shares in the New York Stock Exchange fell while every other large US exchange group made gains, after the European Commission blocked NYSE’s merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse.NYSE shares fell 0.5 per cent to $26.43, even though analysts were generally supportive of the standalone business.“We believe the stock could get a lift in the near term as investors that have been on the sidelines because of deal uncertainty come back into the name,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS.Rob Rutschow at CLSA said “a failed deal may be for the best. We see upside from less exposure to Europe and a potential transaction tax”.Mr Rutschow added that other incumbents could benefit from the collapse of the deal.“If the merger had gone through, there would have been concern that Nasdaq in particular was becoming an also ran in the exchange space globally, but now competitors are under less pressure to do their own deals.”CME Group climbed 2.5 per cent to $245.41, Nasdaq OMX gained a cent to close at $24.77, although shares were hit by fall in fourth quarter net income, and IntercontinentalExchange was up 0.2 per cent to $114.69.Elsewhere, Wall Street was back in tune with global markets, as US stocks climbed higher after a rash of positive global manufacturing survey data.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,324.08, back once again into bull market territory, although the index tended to face resistance from sellers taking profit whenever it moved above 1,325 in January.Banks led the rally with Morgan Stanley up 4 per cent to $19.39, as reports gathered momentum that the investment bank has won the race to be the lead underwriter of Facebook’s IPO.Goldman Sachs lagged behind, up just 1.8 per cent to $113.45, on suggestions it may also have been beaten by JPMorgan to the role of second underwriter in the Facebook deal.Large commercial banks also climbed, with Citigroup up 2.9 per cent to $31.60 and Bank of America climbing 3.2 per cent to $7.36 on reports states’ attorneys-general may be looking at a comprehensive deal on mortgage-related litigation that has been hanging over bank stocks since the financial crisis.Amazon shares fell 7.7 per cent to $179.46 after the company’s fourth-quarter results disappointed on Tuesday evening. Wall Street had been primed for a fall in margins, as the online retailer has pursued growth through heavy spending on its Fire tablet and promotions, but analysts were taken aback by a fall in revenue and sales growth.Brian Nowak at Nomura was equally concerned about the company’s cautious outlook.“This is the seventh straight quarter in which Amazon’s forward . . . guidance has come in below the Street, and the second consecutive quarter where the midpoint of revenue missed guidance. We are lowering our forward estimates,” he told clients.Broadcom climbed 8.1 per cent to $37.13, with management upbeat on the company’s current quarter prospects, without quite calling a bottom to the semiconductor market. That was vindication for analysts who had called for investors to buy the stock in the wake of Apple’s blockbuster results.JPMorgan analysts once again picked out Broadcom’s supplier relationship to Apple smartphones and tablets as they predicted the company will “outgrow the overall semiconductor market [in 2012]”.Whirlpool shares soared 13.5 per cent to $61.64, approaching levels last seen in July, before last summer’s market sell-off. Quarterly profit at the dishwasher manufacturer surged by a fifth on cost savings.Marathon Petroleum shares climbed 9.6 per cent to $41.88, as the company announced a $2bn share buy-back programme. Shares in refiners have slumped in recent weeks after a succession of oil companies announced collapsing margins on refining operations, as the discount of WTI to Brent crude fell in the fourth quarter, increasing input costs for refiners.Shares in hard disc drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.6 per cent to $38.03, as profits at its rival Seagate Technology surged. Seagate shares climbed 20.8 per cent to $25.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,716.46, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,848.27.Gas exploration and production companies sold off again, as natural gas prices reversed their recent rally. Chesapeake Energy fell 0.8 per cent to $20.97, Southwestern Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $30.41 and EQT Corp was off 1.1 per cent to $49.98.Chesapeake, among other companies, has announced cuts in production this year in a bid to put a floor under gas prices.
43;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Whirlpool to reap results on cost cuts;Appliance maker expects earnings boost for 2012;Shares in Whirlpool, the US appliance manufacturer, jumped more than 10 per cent on Wednesday morning after the company forecast “significantly improved” earnings in 2012 and said that its efforts to boost prices and cut costs were beginning to show results.Jeff Fettig, chief executive of Whirlpool, said a combination of new products, higher prices and reduced capacity would help his company to “improve our results in the coming year and show significant progress towards our long-term financial goals”.In 2012, Whirlpool expects to generate earnings of between $5 and $5.50 per share even as the company spends up to $270m on restructuring and similar amounts on resolving long-running legal disputes and pension contributions.Excluding those charges, Whirlpool expects earnings of between $6.50 and $7 per share from its ongoing operations in 2012. Analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of about $5.80 per share in 2012.Still, Whirlpool said its markets would at best experience only limited growth in 2012. The company expects 2012 shipments of appliances to grow 0-3 per cent in North America, 2-5 per cent in Latin America and 2-4 per cent in Asia, and to shrink 2-5 per cent in Europe.During the fourth quarter, sales in North America rose 1 per cent compared to the previous year while sales in Europe slid 7 per cent, as the continent’s ongoing financial crisis “led to weak consumer demand across the eurozone”.For the three months to the end of December, Whirlpool’s net income rose to $205m, or $2.62 a share, compared with $171m, or $2.19, in the same period a year earlier, helped by certain tax credits. Sales dipped to $4.9bn from $5bn a year earlier.For the full year 2011, Whirlpool reported net income of $390m, or $4.99 a share, down from $619m, or $7.97 a share, in 2010, although the numbers were distorted by a host of tax credits and legal settlement costs. Sales rose to $18.7bn from $18.4bn.Over the past few years, Whirlpool and many of its peer manufacturers have been squeezed by a deadly combination of higher costs for raw materials and weak consumer demand, hurting revenues and profits.In response, the company has rolled out new products, pushed through price increases and set targets through 2013 to reduce its fixed costs by about $400m, to cut its workforce by about 5,000 jobs and to slash its manufacturing capacity by about 6m units.“We exit 2011 with improving product price/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and strong new product innovation. These initiatives are the key drivers to improving our operating margins throughout 2012,” Mr Fettig said.Whirlpool has also pushed back against its rivals. The US manufacturer has filed petitions against companies such Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics of South Korea, accusing them of dumping their products in US markets.In early morning trading on Wednesday, Whirlpool shares, which have dropped about 30 per cent over the past year, rose about 11 per cent to $60.37.
44;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-12-28T21:42:57Z;S&P 500 back in negative territory for year;Energy stocks hit by falling crude price;A five-day rally in US equities came to an abrupt end as energy stocks led a sell-off, which put the S&P 500 back in negative territory for the year.The S&P 500 closed down 1.3 per cent to 1,249.64. With just two trading days left in 2011, the benchmark US index is down 0.6 per cent for the year, and is set to end December, historically one of the best months of the year, a mere 0.2 per cent higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 12,151.41 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.3 per cent to 2,589.98.Energy and material stocks fell the most as the price of oil fell for the first time in seven days.Oil explorers Nabors Industries and Chesapeake Energy dropped 4.1 per cent to $17.41 and 3.7 per cent to $22.66 respectively.Investors in refiners, which see margins squeezed when the price of crude oil inputs rise faster than petroleum prices, appeared to catch on to the fact that the price of crude is back up around the $100 a barrel mark. Tesoro fell 4.2 per cent to $23.07 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 and Valero Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $20.77.In the materials sector Californian rare earth metal miner Molycorp fell 14.1 per cent to $24.04, after the Chinese government raised its export quota for rare earths, putting downward pressure on prices.The S&P 500’s financial sector fell 1.6 per cent, with Bank of America off 3.6 per cent to $5.29 and Citigroup off 2.9 per cent to $26.13.Whirlpool, the dishwasher manufacturer, fell 0.6 per cent to $46.37. Shares had slumped more than 8 per cent on Tuesday, as investors feared the worst after Sears Holdings, whose outlets stock Whirlpool products, announced it would close up to 120 stores due to poor sales of consumer electronic goods.Sears Holdings shares also fell another 0.2 per cent to $33.33 after their 25 per cent fall on Tuesday, as analysts responded to the announced store closures.“While the company announced a series of measures to sustain cash flow, we do not see how they dig out of these problems,” said Gary Balter, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.Mr Balter highlighted the company’s resort to bank borrowing lines at a time when retailers see high cash flow from holiday spending, and told clients, “one wonders if vendors begin to worry about their own exposure.”Data from Bloomberg on Wednesday suggested initial public offerings on US exchanges by internet businesses next year may raise $11bn, with Facebook expected to deliver the largest-ever internet IPO.But separate data from Birinyi Associates showed that the 19 internet and social media companies which debuted on US exchanges this year have generally delivered poor returns to investors.While the $6.2bn raised by internet and social media IPOs in 2011 was the third-highest ever, only trailing the $15.9bn raised in 1999 and $9.6bn in 2000, the majority of those companies are currently trading below their debut price.At the close last Friday, this year’s internet IPOs were on average 17.5 per cent below their IPO price compared to a 0.4 per cent decline for all other IPOs.Once first trading day jumps are factored out, new internet stocks have fared even worse. Investors who bought internet stocks at the open on their first day of trading had seen share prices fall an average of 37.5 per cent by the close last Friday, against an average loss on all other IPOs of 14.6 per cent, according to Birinyi.Of those 19 internet IPO stocks, 84 per cent were trading below their debut price at the close last Friday compared to 69 per cent for all the other IPOs this year.The trend continued yesterday with recent IPO stocks continuing to show softness.Social game developer Zynga was down 2.6 per cent to $9.50 yesterday, 50 cents beneath its launch price two weeks after its debut. LinkedIn was off 1.8 per cent to $61.73. The market capitalisation of the professional networking website has fallen by more than one-third since the start of August, although it remains well above its $45 debut price. Groupon fell 1.9 per cent to $22.62.“[Internet IPOs] have created trading opportunities in the short term, but if you are not allocated shares at the IPO price, buying in the open market on the first day of trading with the intent of holding the stock has not been a profitable strategy,” said Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi.
45;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-12-27T21:44:35Z;Sears slump weighs on Wall Street;;The market capitalisation of Sears Holdings fell by more than a quarter yesterday after the company said it would close as many as 120 Kmart and Sears stores after sales of consumer electronics declined in the holiday shopping period.Sears’ shares tumbled 27.2 per cent to $33.38, their lowest level since early 2009.The decision to close stores came after comparable same-store sales for the eight weeks to December 25 fell 5.2 per cent across the group compared with the same period in 2010.The closures will generate $140m to $170m of cash from sales of inventory and the leasing or sales of the locations, the company said in a statement.But that was a drop in the ocean compared to non-cash charges of $1.6bn to $1.8bn that the company said it will book as a result of the poor sales performance.Wall Street opened lowered on the Sears’ announcement and an unexpectedly large fall in the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities. But stocks rallied after a survey of consumer confidence report jumped almost ten points from its November level to 64.5.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day almost back where they started. The S&P was up just 0.01 per cent to 1,265.43 and the Dow edged down 0.02 per cent to 12,291.35Homebuilder stocks are among the best performers in the S&P 500 in the quarter to date, and share prices were little affected by the Case-Schiller data.Lennar was off just 0.4 per cent to $19.30, DR Horton fell 0.8 per cent to $12.35 and PulteGroup close 0.5 per cent lower at $6.05.The Nasdaq Composite index closed up 0.3 per cent to 2,625.2, helped by strong performances by Apple and Google, the two most heavily weighted stocks in the index.Apple was up 0.8 per cent $406.53 and Google climbed 1.1 per cent to $640.25 on reports that 6.8m Apple iPhone and Google Android smartphones were activated on Christmas day, more than double the previous daily record of 2.8m on 25 December 2010.Mead Johnson Nutrition climbed 5.8 per cent to $69.08, recovering some ground from a 10 per cent sell-off in the week before Christmas.The company said it had conducted tests on samples of its Enfamil powdered baby food formula, tied to a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the death of a newborn baby in Missouri, and found no presence of bacteria.Computer Sciences Corp fell 9 per cent to $24.10 after the company withdrew its 2012 financial guidance and said it stood to lose up to $1.5bn after the UK government scrapped the company’s contract to build an electronic patient records database.Stocks with exposure to internet gambling continued to benefit from reports at the end of last week that the Obama administration intended to make it easier for US states to legalise internet poker and certain other online betting.International Game Technology, which sells computerised gaming equipment, climbed 5 per cent to $17.37 and casino chain Wynn Resorts was up 3.2 per cent to $113.53.Shares in dishwasher manufacturer Whirlpool fell 8.9 per cent to $46.62. The share price hit a 52-week low last week, and that appears to have triggered more selling, which had an exaggerated impact amid light trading volumes, traders said.Banks underperformed the wider market with the financial sector of the S&P 500 falling 0.7 per cent, far more than any other broad S&P 500 sector.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $15.29 and Bank of America was off 2.1 per cent to $5.48.MetLife climbed 0.3 per cent to $31.20 as the life insurer said its retail deposit business would be acquired by General Electric financial services division.The business has $7.5bn in customer funds and an online banking platform. General Electric shares were off 1.2 per cent to $18.01.The deal should mean MetLife avoids some regulations faced by banks under the Dodd-Frank financial reform passed last year.Bank stocks have weighed on the S&P 500 throughout the year, and the financial sector is set to end 2011 17.7 per cent lower than it started – easily the worst performing sector in the benchmark US index.Once dividends are included, only financials and materials have failed to deliver a positive return in 2011, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.The CBOE Vix index of volatility edged up for the first time in a week, climbing 5.3 per cent to 21.83, although Wall Street’s “fear gauge” remained well below the elevated levels of the summer, during which it touched a high of 48.00.
46;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-10-30T18:10:52Z;Appliances: slow cycle;The appliance makers told similar tales yet their reports were greeted very differently;"They resemble twins, separated at birth and raised on different continents. Sweden’s Electrolux and Michigan’s Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance makers by sales, look a lot alike. The companies have enterprise values around $6bn. The American will sell about $19bn dishwashers, refrigerators and washing machines this year; the Swede (which sells vacuums, too) about $16 bn. Both depend on the US and Europe for well over half their sales. Both get by on single-digit operating margins that can drop close to zero when times are tough.And times are tough. Both companies reported results on Friday and had similar stories to tell: sales were nearly flat at both companies, net of currency effects. Demand in the developed world is weak and is better, though hardly stellar, in emerging countries. Commodity costs are pinching them. Operating margins were 3 per cent at Whirlpool and 4 per cent at Electrolux, down sharply from the year before. Yet the two reports were greeted very differently. Whirlpool’s shares lost a sixth of their value while Electrolux’s rose. The difference was Whirlpool’s much gloomier outlook: the company cut its 2011 earnings forecast by a third and announced that it would shed 5,000 jobs (7 per cent of its global workforce) in North America and Europe as part of an effort to reduce fixed costs. Especially discouraging, Whirlpool cut its demand outlook for the Latin American and Asian markets.Of the two, Electrolux appears to have the edge in execution at present, especially in the emerging world, where it recently made acquisitions in Egypt and Chile. But Whirlpool’s cuts show that it is serious about shifting towards growth markets, too. And the most important variables for both companies remain the mood of rich-world consumers and commodity costs. The difference between these siblings should not be exaggerated.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
47;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-10-28T16:22:45Z;Whirlpool warns consumers are being squeezed;;Shares in Whirlpool dropped sharply after the US white goods maker slashed its full-year earnings forecast and said it would cut more than 5,000 jobs, mainly in North America and Europe, in response to weak demand and rising raw material costs.Jeff Fettig, chief executive of Whirlpool, said that consumer confidence had slumped in the US and that demand was hovering around the levels of the 2009 recession. He added that customers in emerging markets were also ordering fewer white goods than previously expected.Whirlpool now expects North American demand to fall as much as 5 per cent in 2011, 3 percentage points more than previously forecast, and demand from Latin America to grow between 0 and 5 per cent, compared with previous estimates for 5 to 10 per cent growth.At the same time raw material prices have soared. Prices for resins, copper, oil and aluminium rose by between 15 per cent and 25 per cent in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2010, squeezing margins.Since the middle of the year, appliance makers in the US and Europe have reported increasingly gloomy results. On Friday Electrolux, the Swedish home appliance maker, reported a sharp fall in net income and reduced its sales expectations for North America.In response, manufacturers have attempted to raise prices, cut costs and improve productivity. Whirlpool plans to implement across the board price increases in North America in January 2012, after raising prices in April and August of 2011.Whirlpool also announced sharp cost reductions. The company said it would spend about $500m to trim about 5,000 jobs, to close a facility in Arkansas and shift dishwasher production from Germany to Poland. The moves will cut capacity by 6m units and reduce annual costs by $400m from 2013.“Weak demand levels and high inflation don’t tend to go together but that is the environment and that’s what it’s been,” one Whirlpool executive told investors on a conference call. Management said expanding operating margins was the company’s first priority.The company cut its forecast for 2011 earnings per share to between $4.75 and $5.25 compared with its previous estimate of between $7.25 and $8.25 per share. Whirlpool expects to have an outflow of cash of up to $200m, down from an inflow of up to $200m.Whirlpool, which makes the Whirlpool, Maytag and Amada brands of home appliances, employs about 71,000 people and had annual sales of about $18bn in 2010.In the third quarter, net income more than doubled to $177m, or $2.31 per share, compared with the same period in 2010. The results were flattered by tax credits that boosted profits in 2011 and by litigation costs that depressed earnings in 2010. Sales rose slightly to $4.6bn helped by currency effects.Whirlpool shares, which have lost about 40 per cent of their value over the year to date, fell 11 per cent to about $53.70 by midday on Friday in New York trading.
48;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-09-15T20:03:02Z;High street browsers and job fears add to woes;;"Selling electrical goods in developed markets is the bleakest part of the retail landscape.In tough economic conditions, consumers worried about their jobs are unlikely to buy large television sets, and even those who feel more secure may choose to pay down debt rather than splash out on large purchases.Retail consultants also point to the impact from low levels of activity among homebuyers. “The weak housing market has caused a drop off in sales of white goods and bigger ticket electricals,” says Maureen Hinton of Verdict.Meanwhile, customers who are prepared to buy are increasingly treating stores as showrooms to inform their decisions before they make their purchases more cheaply elsewhere, perhaps from a supermarket or an online supplier.The difficulties have been felt by home appliance manufacturers as well. Philips, Electrolux and Whirlpool all reported disappointing quarterly results in July.Yet even in the context of sales falls at other retailers exposed to consumer electricals in the UK, such as Dixons and Home Retail last week, the sales drop at Comet, owned by Kesa Electricals, stands out.“I think the management must just have taken their eye off the ball so far as Comet is concerned,” says Ben Hunt, retail analyst at Oriel Securities.Certainly, the actions now being taken to turn the business around have the appearance of retail basics rather than anything very sophisticated.More space in the stores is being given to higher-margin products such as headphones and other accessories; computers are being displayed in a way that makes it easier for customers to try them; large and postpone-able purchases such as fridges and washing machines are no longer dominating the front of the stores.While this approach is likely to improve sales, Kesa is not relying on it as the only possible solution, reiterating that talks to sell Comet are continuing. But the likelihood that it can only be sold with a cash dowry estimated at up to £200m ($316m) must surely limit the prospects of a sale.As some analysts question who might be interested in buying the business, others raise the issue of whether Comet has a role at all. “Do they really need to exist?” asks one.The answer is not necessarily as harsh as the quarterly sales drop might suggest. The upside of operating in such difficult conditions is that competitors must deal with them as well.Neither of Comet’s most direct rivals is in great shape. The sales decrease at Dixons was less severe, but it suffered a gross margin hit, and has a fragile balance sheet and high operational gearing.Best Buy has 11 “big box” stores in the UK in partnership with Carphone Warehouse and, after announcing in June that the business had racked up annual losses of £62m, said it was considering closing the stores.“There needs to be a reduction in space in UK electrical retailing,” says Mr Hunt.“At the moment, there’s not enough profit to share among the competition, and there’s not exactly a great deal of product coming to market to act as a catalyst for boosting sales.”So if one of the specialist electrical retailers quit the field, then the “last man standing” theory should mean that the survivors would emerge to find a more forgiving retail environment.Some analysts believe that the UK market may already be past its worst, with Adam Cochrane, retail analyst at UBS, suggesting that the continental European markets are likely to face a much tougher year in 2012.But other analysts believe that even a lone survivor may not find life significantly easier, unless the withdrawal of capacity translates into better returns.The continuing presence of the supermarkets and online retailers in the market makes that far from a certainty."
49;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Electrolux makes acquisition in Latin America;;Electrolux has stepped up its search for fresh growth in emerging markets with a $690m deal to buy the biggest maker of home appliances in Chile and Argentina.The Swedish white goods maker is looking to emerging markets for relief from weakness in its core European and US markets amid fears of a renewed downturn in the western economies.The planned acquisition of Chile-based CTI comes just more than a month after Electrolux finalised a deal to buy Egypt’s Olympic Group, the biggest appliance maker in the Middle East and north Africa, despite political instability in the region.Keith McLoughlin, Electrolux chief executive, said the two acquisitions would together increase emerging market sales to 35 per cent of the company’s total, from the mid-20s previously, and vowed to raise the proportion further.CTI, which makes cookers, refrigerators, washing machines and heaters, has 36 per cent of the Chilean market and is also strong in Argentina.Mr McLoughlin said the acquisition would complement Electrolux’s strong position in Brazil and raise its share of the overall Latin American market to about a fifth.Under the deal, Electrolux will buy a 64 per cent controlling stake in CTI from Sigdo Koppers, the Chilean conglomerate, and launch an all-cash tender offer of 34.87 Chilean pesos a share for the remaining stock.Analysts at Danske Bank said the CTI and Olympic acquisitions would not have a dramatic effect on earnings but noted that the prices paid seemed reasonable “and the strategic importance should not be underestimated”.Shares in Electrolux have fallen by more than a third in the past six months because of pressure on margins from high input costs and concern over the economic outlook. However, the stock rose 1.6 per cent after Monday’s announcement.As part of the deal, Electrolux will also begin a cash tender offer of 325 pesos a share for Somela, a CTI subsidiary.The Swedish company, the world’s second-largest appliance maker after Whirlpool of the US, said the overall acquisition would have an enterprise value of SKr4.4bn ($693m).“CTI appears to be an ideal target,” said James Stettler, analyst at UniCredit. “Expanding the base makes sense, but execution will be key.”
50;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-07-22T22:22:08Z;Consumers reluctant to buy washing machines;;It is a tough time to be selling washing machines and other household appliances to consumers in western Europe and North America, as poor results from Philips, Electrolux and Whirlpool made clear this week.Behind the bad news lie a number of awkward trends. Despite a pullback in recent weeks, raw material costs remain high, especially for oil and steel, putting considerable pressure on operating margins.On Thursday Whirlpool, the US company behind the Maytag and Amana brands, said it was now forecasting record full-year raw material and oil-related costs of between $450m and $500m – double the company’s estimate in early February.Meanwhile, consumer demand in developed markets remains weak as families choose to pay down debt, the housing construction market is still in the doldrums and competition is fierce. That makes raising prices a struggle.At the same time the withdrawal of US government stimulus spending, which included certain incentive programmes to encourage the sale of energy-efficient appliances, has only added to the pressure on sales volumes.“We think these big mature markets where we are very exposed are not healthy,” Keith McLoughlin, chief executive of Electrolux, said on Tuesday. “They are going to take a while to recover.”Second-quarter net profits at the Swedish home appliance maker slumped 45 per cent to SKr561m ($88.5m), while sales dropped 12 per cent to SKr24.1bn, and executives warned that the rest of the year would be only modestly better.In response, manufacturers have pushed through price increases, developed new, less material-heavy products and focused their efforts on fast-growing emerging markets, but it remains an uphill battle.
51;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-07-21T17:07:03Z;Whirlpool swings to $161m loss;;Whirlpool, the US household-appliance maker, swung to a loss in the second quarter as it settled a legal dispute and struggled to cope with a “difficult economic environment” characterised by higher raw material prices and volatile demand.Jeff Fettig, chief executive, said consumer demand was being hurt by “high unemployment, low consumer confidence, and recessionary housing levels” in North America and Europe while high inflation was starting to hit emerging markets.Already this week, a number of global appliance makers including Electrolux of Sweden and Philips of the Netherlands have reported disappointing results, caught between higher input costs and sluggish demand in developed markets.Whirlpool’s sales in North America slid 7 per cent to $2.4bn, but rose 14 per cent to $841m in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and gained 25 per cent to $1.3bn in Latin America.Whirlpool shares closed down 3.8 per cent at $72.78. Over the year to date, the stock price has fallen about 17 per cent on fears that a sagging economic recovery would dent consumer demand.The Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company reported a loss of $161m, or $2.10 per share, in the three months to the end of June compared to a net profit of $205m, or $2.64 per share, in the same period last year.Much of the loss stemmed from $522m in expenses to settle a long-standing dispute with Banco Safra over an unauthorised loan undertaken in 1989 by an employee of a company that later became part of Whirlpool.Excluding non-operating charges, Whirlpool earned $2.76 per share compared to $2.82 in the same period in 2010. Sales rose 4 per cent to $4.7bn, thanks largely to currency effects, but global shipments of white goods rose year over year.Whirlpool, which makes the Whirlpool, Maytag and Amana brands of home appliances, employs about 71,000 people and had annual sales of about $18bn in 2010.Mr Fettig said he expected “global economic volatility to continue in the near term”, and said the company was now forecasting record full-year raw material and oil related costs of between $450m and $500m – double the company’s estimate in early February.But he added that the company would aggressively pursue margin improvements by raising prices, introducing new, less material-heavy products and by optimising its supply chain to reduce freight and warehousing costs.Whirlpool reaffirmed its full-year guidance for operating earnings per share of between $12 and $13 and free cash flow guidance of between $400m and $500m, but said that the current environment meant it would likely hit the low end of the range.
52;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-07-19T19:09:44Z;Electrolux hit by high raw material costs;;Shares in Electrolux fell more than 16 per cent on Tuesday after the Swedish home appliance maker announced a sharp drop in second-quarter profits and warned of more difficulties ahead amid high raw material prices and weak consumer demand in debt-laden western markets.The results highlighted the tough conditions facing consumer product companies a day after Philips, the Dutch electronics group, revealed a big quarterly loss because of writedowns to reflect lower growth expectations.Electrolux, the world’s second biggest home appliance maker by sales after Whirlpool of the US, said it was being squeezed by increased production and transportation costs at the same time as struggling with sluggish demand in the US and western Europe.“We think these big mature markets where we are very exposed are not healthy,” said Keith McLoughlin, Electrolux chief executive. “They are going to take a while to recover.”After Tuesday’s sharp decline, shares in Electrolux have lost more than a third of their value since US-born Mr McLoughlin became the company’s first non-Swedish chief executive in January.Investors had hoped Mr McLoughlin would deliver growth after years of aggressive restructuring by his predecessor, Hans Stråberg, but rising commodity prices and the faltering global recovery have so far conspired against him.“Earnings are falling and there is an erosion of expectation which has been going on throughout this year,” said Rasmus Engberg, analyst at Handelsbanken.Net profits fell by a worse-than-expected 45 per cent from last year to SKr561m, while sales were down 12 per cent at SKr24.1bn.Mr McLoughlin highlighted the withdrawal of US government stimulus spending – including an incentive scheme to promote sales of energy efficient appliances – as one of the factors behind the poor results.In Europe, he singled out “very weak demand” in Italy, one of Electrolux’s biggest markets, as a trouble spot.Mr McLoughlin said results would be better in the second half of 2011 than the first, owing in part to the recent easing in commodity prices, but warned the outlook remained “difficult”.The Stockholm-based company revised down its forecast for growth in European demand this year to 1 per cent, from 2 per cent previously, and for North America to no more than 3 per cent from previous guidance of 3-5 per cent.Despite the weak markets, Electrolux said it would press ahead with efforts to offset increased costs and declining volumes with higher prices for its products, such as washing machines, cookers and vacuum cleaners. Prices have already been raised in North America, with another increase planned for August, and Electrolux said it would lift European prices by 5-7 per cent from October.Electrolux is trying to compensate for weakness in western economies by seeking fresh growth in emerging markets. Last week, the company announced a final agreement to buy Egypt-based Olympic Group, the biggest appliance maker in the Middle East and north Africa, in a deal which was delayed but not derailed by political unrest in the region.
53;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-07-10T15:38:23Z;Suppliers switch tactics to hold on to customers;;Small US industrial companies that supply components for some of the world’s biggest manufacturers have turned to a range of new customer-service techniques – from cutting the time they take to complete an order to communicating with customers via Facebook and Twitter – amid intensifying competition in the manufacturing supply chain.Although thousands of small industrial suppliers went out of business during the downturn, many of those that survived did so by expanding into new sectors and winning new customers, increasing competition for business as suppliers diversified into each others’ traditional territories.Lingering worries that the companies they supply could go bankrupt and increasing competition are the top concerns of small and medium-sized US industrial groups, according to a survey of 3,400 companies due to be released on Tuesday by ThomasNet, a website for researching industrial suppliers.“The competition is the fiercest I’ve ever seen it,” said Nancy Simmons, president of Aero Industries, a metals distributor based in Orlando that has nine employees and whose customers include Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and Nasa.In response, Aero has sought to differentiate itself by offering its customers a range of business consulting services. It has drawn on its own experience – expanding exports from 1 per cent of revenues three years ago to one-fifth now – to advise on export opportunities, giving help on logistics, markets and legal issues.“There’s been consolidation among industrial suppliers, so we’re seeing bigger, more aggressive competitors, while at the same time the customer base has been shrinking,” said Richard Rubin, president of Maxi Container, a Detroit-based maker of industrial packaging with 20 employees, whose customers include Campbell Soup, BASF and Ford.To win and retain customers, Maxi has begun blogging, and is using social media such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Mr Rubin said such strategies helped him win a new contract with Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paint and chemicals group. Mr Rubin has also instituted a “customer of the month” award.Perfection Spring and Stamping, a family-owned business in Mount Prospect, Illinois, that makes metal components for companies including Continental, Bosch and Whirlpool, recently increased its sales team’s travel budget by $50,000, overhauled its website and upgraded its sales tracking and reporting system.“We’ve added 13 new customers that came through the website – half of them multinational companies and eight from sectors we’ve never served before,” said David Kahn, chief executive.For large manufacturers, the intensifying competition among suppliers has helped drive down costs and lead times. “The big manufacturers are really beating us up on price, delivery time and quality,” said Ms Simmons.“A lot of former automotive suppliers have transferred over to the medical equipment market,” said Mr Kahn. “They’re bringing auto-industry ideas – such as annual cost reductions – with them.”
54;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-05-02T22:04:22Z;Pharmaceuticals boost US sentiment;;"Deal activity lifted the healthcare sector to a multiyear high, but the wider markets closed slightly lower as the market euphoria following the news of Osama bin Laden’s death fizzled out and investors turned their attention back to more humdrum
economic matters.Teva Pharmaceuticals, a generic drugmaker with its headquarters in Israel, announced a $6.8bn deal on Monday to purchase Cephalon, the US pharmaceutical company, helping to lift the wider healthcare sector.The news sent shares in Cephalon up 4 per cent to $80.11, near its all-time high, while Teva’s American shares added 3.4 per cent to $47.27.The deal will see Teva pay $81.50 a share, outgunning a $73 a share hostile approach for Cephalon made in March by Valeant. Shares in Valeant fell 5.8 per cent to $49.58 on the news.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 4.8 per cent to $34.74 and Watson Pharmaceutical rose 2.2 per cent to $63.36. The S&P healthcare index put on 1 per cent. That performance made it the best performing sector on Wall Street and took the index to a three-year high.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,361.21, weighed on primarily by energy stocks as oil prices softened. Halliburton was down 3.1 per cent to $48.92 while Schlumberger lost 2.2 per cent to $87.79. The S&P energy sector lost 1.3 per cent.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average flat at 12,806.83, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,864.08.Healthy ISM manufacturing data helped to limit losses on Wall Street. The data showed a slightly less robust manufacturing expansion in April than the previous month, but the 60.4 reading still indicated a healthy rate of growth in the sector.News on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world and left Wall Street higher in early trading. But the markets fell flat shortly after lunch and then began to tick lower as investors took a more even-handed look at the real market implications of the news.“Obviously there has been a little bit of euphoria and a sense of relief following bin Laden’s death, but fundamentally this news has little relevance for the equity markets,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.“The markets are more interested in fundamental factors like the success of the current earnings season,” he said.The earnings season so far has been solid. Of the 302 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings, 76 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations, compared with 73 per cent last quarter.The materials, consumer discretionary and financial sectors have been the best performing, on average beating analysts’ earnings expectations by about 13 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.The best performing stocks in the material sector have been Freeport-McMoRan and Nucor, which reported earnings 24 per cent and 41 per cent higher than expected, respectively.In the consumer discretionary area, Whirlpool and Ford Motor have reported some of the biggest “beats”, with their earnings coming in 32 per cent and 25 per cent higher than estimates. Among financials, SunTrust beat estimates by 103 per cent and Goldman Sachs by 92 per cent.Since the start of the earnings season on April 11 when Alcoa reported, the S&P materials index has risen 2.1 per cent. In the same period, the financial index has dipped 0.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary index has gained 4.2 per cent.Looking back to Monday’s session, deal activity in the materials sector also helped lift sentiment in the wider market. International Coal Group jumped 30.8 per cent to $14.43 after Arch Coal said it had agreed a $3.4bn deal with the coal producer.Arch said it would pay $14.60 per share for its smaller rival, a 32 per cent premium to the closing stock price on Friday. Shares in Arch were down 2.2 per cent to $33.53.Alcoa was up 1.3 per cent to $17.22 after the aluminium producer was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.In earnings news, Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was up
19 per cent to $29.79 as the company reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled, helped by a patent settlement with TiVo."

Setting a trend that has been followed by many Chinese companies, Haier began 10 years ago by buying an Italian company in trouble: Meneghetti refrigerators.“A paradigm has been broken,” said Mr Albrizio, who used to work for Whirlpool of the US. “Before it was western countries that delocalised in China, now it’s not like that any more. There are so many reasons to delocalise in the west.”According to Invitalia, the Italian development agency, Haier is one of 57 Chinese companies in Italy that have bought up an Italian enterprise or that have a shareholding in an Italian company.Haier’s plant near Padua in northern Italy employs 130 workers; of whom only one is a Chinese national. Products carry a Made in Italy label and are also marketed in Africa. People initially feared the plant would be a sweatshop but now, Mr Albrizio said, “people queue up to work here”.With global sales of $18.2bn in 2009, Haier regards Italy as the gateway to Europe. Gianluca Di Pietro, Haier’s general manager for Italy and Greece, said it aimed to double production in Europe this year from a daily output of 380 fridges and freezers last year. Haier’s goal, he said, was to be among the top five white goods producers in Europe by 2014.Haier’s success in establishing a foothold in Italy was supported by its experience in China. It was part of two joint ventures in the 1990s with Italian Indesit, Europe’s leading home appliances maker, which ended 10 years later when Indesit pulled out of China."
56;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-02-02T22:03:31Z;Mixed earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street slipped slightly after a mixed batch of earnings reports, but indices stayed close to the 28-month highs reached in the previous session.Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, reported that its fourth-quarter earnings had missed forecasts, sending shares down 2.1 per cent to $83.60. The company re-ported earnings of $171m or $2.19 a share, falling short of consensus forecasts of $2.26 a share as the high costs of items such as paint and steel ate at margins.Hershey, the confectionery company, also admitted it was struggling with margins given the rising cost of cocoa and sugar, but still managed to deliver fourth-quarter earnings in line with expectations. Shares were up 3.1 per cent to $48.61.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.3 per cent to 1,304.03, keeping above the psychologically significant 1,300 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average maintained the 12,000 mark, keeping flat at 12,041.97. The Dow closed above 12,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June 2008. The Nasdaq Composite was also flat at 2,750.16.“The markets are taking a little bit of a breather right now as investors try to work out whether there is more to go in this rally. There seems to be equal sentiment on both sides about whether we are due a correction or the bull run will continue,” said Christian Magoon of Magoon Capital, an independent consultancy on exchange traded funds.Investor sentiment was lifted by healthy figures from the ADP employment survey, which estimated that private non-farm payroll employment will have risen by 187,000 in January, ahead of the 140,000 forecast by economists.This prompted some optimism that the non-farm payrolls report to come out on Friday will be strong, but traders were reluctant to become too overjoyed as there is not always a direct correlation between the two figures. ADP also lowered its December figure to 247,000 new jobs from a previous estimate of 297,000.The financial sector saw the worst losses in the session. The S&P financials index was down 0.9 per cent to 223.50 led by Genworth Financial, a mortgage guarantor and life insurer, which fell 8.5 per cent to $12.76 after posting a loss in the fourth-quarter. Michael Frazier, chief executive, said that the results were not acceptable.Elsewhere, Marathon Oil, the fourth-largest US oil and gas group, reported fourth-quarter earnings up 99 per cent due to higher oil prices. While the results beat analysts’ expectations, the markets have come to expect impressive results after bumper earnings from other oil giants such as ExxonMobil, and so the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $46.89. Also in the sector Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure-control equipment, gained 4.5 per cent to $56.08 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings up 69 per cent.Solar stocks also rose after MEMC Electronic Materials, a silicon maker, gave a strong 2011 sales forecast. The stock jumped 15.4 per cent to $13.42 while First Solar, which makes photovoltaic panels, was up 5.3 per cent to $164.40.Meanwhile, shares in Electronic Arts rose 15.8 per cent to $18.09 after the company unexpectedly announced a $600m share buy-back. EA, the second-largest video game publisher, also reported earnings figures showing a 39 per cent growth in digital revenues in its third quarter, suggesting that its digital strategy was paying off.Elsewhere in the entertainment industry, Time Warner, the media group, reported fourth-quarter profits up 22 per cent and gave a forecast for double-digit earnings growth in 2011. The company, which owns television networks such as HBO, also announced an 11 per cent increase in the company’s dividend and a $5m share repurchasing plan sending the stock up 8.6 per cent to $35.10.NaviSite, a cloud computing company, soared 32.2 per cent to $5.46 on news it was going to be bought by Time Warner Cable for $230m, or $5.50 a share. Time Warner Cable was up 0.9 per cent to $69.33.Mattel, the world’s biggest toymaker, was up 0.9 per cent to $24.37 after reporting improved sales and boosting its dividend.In the pharmaceutical sector, Chelsea Therapeutics International was down 18.5 per cent to $5.04 after the biotechnology company said it was changing the goal for a late-stage study of its hypotension drug after a disappointing interim study.
57;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2011-02-02T20:13:49Z;Cash piles;Perhaps they are not such a great reason to buy stocks;At the turn of the year, the following idea was widespread: companies had copious cash piles, therefore they would soon distribute them to their shareholders, and this would boost their share price. Every step of this argument is now being proved wrong. Look no further than household appliances.Whirlpool of the US and Sweden’s Electrolux, the industry’s biggest companies by sales, have both enjoyed stunning rebounds since the crisis, and both released results on Wednesday. Both announced earnings ahead of expectations, but predicted rising raw materials costs for 2011. And both saw sharp sell-offs, with Electrolux suffering more than any other stock in the FTSE-Eurofirst 300 index.Why? Years of tight cost control left Electrolux with a lot of cash. One typical bullish note from last month praised its “big cash distribution potential”. Electrolux did raise its ordinary dividend by 63 per cent compared with 2009. But it did not declare a special dividend on top. Cue an 8 per cent sell-off.Obviously, the “corporate cash piles” story had been overdone. Further, while companies such as Electrolux do have a lot of cash, it does not follow that they can easily dispose of it. Managers worried about rising costs (themselves the result of the easy money that helped create the cash piles) want a cushion.More fundamentally, it is a fallacy that dividends can boost shareholder value. The cash sitting on the company’s balance sheet is theirs, just as much as it would be if it were paid to them in a cheque. Investors could equally easily raise the same amount of cash (tax rates notwithstanding) by selling a block of shares.CEOs with some cash in hand and anaemic results up their sleeve might take notice, and declare a special dividend. Sadly, a plurality of investors would be fooled.E-mail the Lex team in confidence

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking.

Each of these projects could provide about £400m of revenue for Invensys.The company is also thought to be bidding for rail signalling replacement work in Denmark, which could deliver a similar increase in sales.Invensys said that a recovery in industrial capital expenditure had helped orders at its operations management division – which supplies software and control systems to global manufacturers – although the orders had been won at lower margins than average. And the company expects revenues and profits at the controls business – which supplies parts to white goods manufacturers such as Whirlpool and Electrolux – to suffer a “small decline” due to weak demand, particularly in North America.Invensys resumed dividend payments in 2009 following a six-year hiatus and several years of recovery under Ulf Henriksson, chief executive.Although its share price has not kept track with the recovery in engineering-related stocks more exposed to mining, oil and gas and power generation over the past year, they have enjoyed a strong run in the past six months, gaining about 50 per cent as expectations grew of a sustained recovery in its industrial end markets improved.The shares, however, closed down 27.8p yesterday at 329.6p.FT commentAlthough some estimates of Invensys’ turnover and profits were edged down yesterday, the 8 per cent fall in the share price seems overcooked. UBS, for example, edged down group revenue forecasts by a modest 1.3 per cent to £2.46bn – that still implies 8 per cent organic growth for the year to March 2011 with another 6 per cent to come next year. Pre-tax profits are also forecast to rise from £179m towards £230m this year, with another £20m increase next year. A p/e ratio of about 14 for 2011 reflects share price weakness rather than the promise of spectacular earnings growth. But weakness in a stock that last year flirted with regulation from the FTSE 100 could offer a contrarian trading opportunity.
60;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-12-22T19:08:23Z;Cutting a stern figure to the last;;Electrolux workers could be forgiven for expecting Hans Stråberg to be in a benevolent mood as he prepares to step down on January 1 after nine years in charge of the Swedish home appliance maker.Instead, one of his final acts as chief executive was the announcement last week of a further 2,100 job cuts in Europe and North America, including the closure of a big plant in Canada.It was perhaps a fitting finale for a man who has shut more than 30 factories in one of the most aggressive cost-reduction programmes witnessed anywhere in the European manufacturing sector.“Those kind of decisions have been the hardest part of the job,” says Mr Stråberg, while insisting they were essential for survival. “Nobody can come up with a cheaper vacuum cleaner than we have today. But getting to this point has been a murderous process.”The Stockholm-based company has shifted nearly 60 per cent of production to low-cost countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Thailand to defend its position as the world’s number two appliance maker after Whirlpool of the US amid rising competition from Asia.With the bulk of restructuring complete, Mr Stråberg says it feels like a natural time for change at the top. “I’ve been with Electrolux 27 years and chief executive for nine. My mission is accomplished. Now it’s time for someone else to take the company to its next phase.”That someone is Keith McLoughlin, previously chief operating officer, who joined Electrolux from DuPont, the US chemicals group, in 2003. As an American, he will be the company’s first non-Swedish chief executive.After years of cost-cutting, investors are hoping Mr McLoughlin will shift the focus to growth. That will not be easy with the company’s two biggest regions, North America and Europe, recovering only slowly and unevenly from deep slumps. Rising raw material costs and fierce price competition are also threats, with analysts questioning whether recent margin improvements can be sustained.However, the outlook is lifted by surging demand from Asia and Latin America, which accounted for nearly a quarter of sales in the third quarter. Electrolux highlighted its push into emerging markets in October with a $480m deal to buy Egypt’s Olympic Group, which is the biggest appliance maker in the Middle East and North Africa.While Mr Stråberg agrees the emphasis must shift to growth, he says the drive for greater efficiency is not over. A fresh cost-cutting programme launched in November aims to save at least SKr2bn ($291m) a year by streamlining design and procurement. For example, Electrolux uses 240 different types of oven door across its product range. That is a reduction from 350 in the past but leaves plenty of scope for more standardisation.Under Mr Stråberg, the company narrowed its once-sprawling brand portfolio – Frigidaire, AEG and Zanussi are among the handful of survivors – and spun off Husqvarna, its former garden equipment business. As a result, he says, Mr McLoughlin will inherit a more focused, consumer-orientated company. Shareholders have been rewarded with an average annual return of 24 per cent over the past five years, well ahead of most peers. The stock price is up only slightly from when Mr Stråberg took over but it has tripled in the past two years.One of the main beneficiaries has been Sweden’s powerful Wallenberg family, whose holding company, Investor, owns nearly 30 per cent of voting rights in Electrolux. The appointment of Mr McLoughlin could be viewed as a sign of greater openness to foreign executives in Sweden’s clubby business world. However, Mr Stråberg says Electrolux has long had an international culture, with five of its six divisions led by non-Swedes. Unlike Ikea or Volvo, he argues, the company is not “trying to sell Swedishness”.Aged 53, Mr Stråberg plans to stay active in business by investing in unlisted growth companies and accepting more boardroom assignments on top of his role as director of Stora Enso, the papermaker. His first advice to any company seeking his services will be to recognise the rules of global business are changing. “If you understand what is happening you have a chance to adapt. But let’s not fool ourselves into thinking western companies are going to have it all our own way.”

Ackman’s company owns shares in Borders. Shares in Borders surged 28.7 per cent to $1.39.Verigy jumped 41.7 per cent to $12.95 after the maker of semiconductor testing equipment said it had received an unsolicited bid from Tokyo-based Advantest Corp.Verigy said its board would discuss the offer with Advantest but that it did not think the bid was superior to a pending transaction with LTX Credence Corp. Shares in LTX-Credence Corp sank 12.4 per cent to $7.40.3M nudged down 0.1 per cent to $86.88 after the industrial conglomerate agreed to buy Winterthur Technologies, a Swiss maker of grinding tools, for $448m or SFr62 per share, above the Friday’s SFr58 close.3M said that the market for Winterthur’s diamond-grinding wheels and abrasive tools was expected to grow at more than 4 per cent a year.There was a series of senior US job moves with Pfizer gaining 0.5 per cent to $16.81 after the drug maker appointed a new chief executive.Ian Read, former head of global biopharmaceutical operations, was named chief executive, replacing Jeffrey Kindler who has retired. Mr Kindler had held the job since July 2006.“Although Kindler was a controversial figure with the Street, his departure is unexpected,” said analysts at JPMorgan. “From our point of view, while this management change will likely introduce some near-term disruptions, the move could accelerate strategic actions such as more aggressive repurchase or dividend policies as well as business development or divestitures priorities that we believe would be viewed as a positive by the Street.”Kellogg was almost flat at $49.30 after the cereal maker appointed John Bryant, previously chief operating officer, as its new chief executive. Mr Bryant follows David Mackay, who has retired but will work on the transition until March.The food company also reiterated its forecasts for 2010 and 2011, expecting operating profit to be flat in 2010 but between flat and a 2 per cent decline in 2011.Massey Energy added 2.4 per cent to $51.63 after the coal miner said Baxter Phillips Junior, its president, would succeed Don Blankenship as chief executive when he retired at the end of the year.Dollar Generalfell 7.3 per cent to $30.99 after the discount retailer reported 25m shares will be sold by members of senior management and an entity tied to the directors of the company.

Its not a secular phenomenon, it's a cyclical fact.”He added that cost-cutting and strength in emerging markets was softening the blow at P&G.Shares in Kimberly-Clark suffered on Tuesday, falling 5.8 per cent, after it posted a 19 per cent drop in profit and lowered its forecasts because of rising materials costs.They continued to slide on Wednesday, down 0.4 per cent to $62.35.The consumer discretionary sector lost 0.5 per cent after home appliance makers beat expectations but warned that the outlook was volatile.Whirlpool said sales remained flat and it beat profit expectations by tightly controlling costs.Sales fell in the US and Europe as consumers refrained from buying large ticket items, some of which are closely tied to buying a new house, but sales grew in emerging markets. Its shares sunk 4.1 per cent to $81.04.Whirlpool’s announcement mirrored that of its Swedish competitor Electrolux, which reported its results earlier in the European session.US-listed shares in Electrolux dropped 4.4 per cent to $48.10.Before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures extended losses after a durable goods report showed that orders rose more than expected in September. But when the volatile transportation sector was excluded, orders actually fell.The S&P 500 industrials index lost 0.7 per cent with Boeing declining by 0.6 per cent to $70.86 and Caterpillar down by 0.6 per cent to $78.22.Dan Greenhaus, chief economist at Miller-Tabak, said business spending had shown a noticeable slowing over the past few months and it was one of the reasons why third-quarter GDP, due to be released on Friday, will not show a meaningful surprise on the upside.Elsewhere in earnings news, Comcast climbed 3.2 per cent to $20.27 after the largest cable operator in the US beat expectations with its quarterly earnings, excluding the costs related to its deal to take control of NBC Universal.Revenue was also better than expected as it sold more packages offering cable, phone and internet service, pushing up revenue per video customer and helping to compensate for customers who cut services because of the economy.But Sprint Nextel dropped 9.9 per cent to $4.30 after the mobile phone carrier reported a larger loss than expected.The company subsidised customer upgrades to phones capable of working on its new networks.The number of contract customers, who pay their bills after making the calls, fell at a lower rate but the company was still losing these valuable subscribers.
63;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-10-27T19:12:25Z;Invensys slides on fears over trading and Chinese rival;;Fears about trading and competition weighed on Invensysas the FTSE 100 slid for a second day.Shares in the engineer lost 3.6 per cent to 299½p in response to cautious guidance from Whirlpool and Electrolux, both key customers for its appliance control business. Whirlpool said sales growth had slowed significantly in the third quarter, while Electrolux warned about rising raw materials costs.Analysts also noted news that Hollysys, a Chinese engineer, would begin supplying its own specification of control systems to the nation’s nuclear industry.“Invensys, which has signed orders for six Chinese reactors to date, is faced with a potential tough new competitor,” said Unicredit. “Foreign automation suppliers will continue to be squeezed out of what is becoming the world’s largest nuclear market.”Hollysys in 2005 formed a joint venture with China Guangdong, the state-owned nuclear power corporation, to develop proprietary automation systems. The groups said on Wednesday they had completed development of Hollysys’s own technology that “meets or surpasses all the functional matrix compared with foreign systems”.Invensys, which is due to report interim results on November 4, makes about $400m from its contracts with China Nuclear Power Engineering, Unicredit said.Miners led the wider market lower as a stronger dollar weighed on metals prices.

US competitor Equinix, which warned on profits earlier in October, said overnight that European growth had nevertheless remained robust.A Morgan Stanley upgrade helped lift Halfordsby 4 per cent to 425¾p. The shares are at a 31 per cent discount to the retail sector and offer a double-digit cash flow yield, which puts them on a similar valuation to HMV even though Halfords does not face similar structural challenges, Morgan Stanley said.Vague bid speculation helped squeeze Croda, the speciality chemicals maker, up 1.3 per cent to £15.15. Continued takeover hopes also helped Catlin, the Lloyds insurer, which was up 0.6 per cent to 350p.CSRlost 10.3 per cent to 309½p after the bluetooth chipmaker warned that its loss of smartphone market share would hit revenues for the fourth quarter and into 2011. The group is not expected to match rivals’ products before 2012, analysts said. However, they noted the group, whose $457m cash pile is equivalent to about half of its market capitalisation, had restarted a share buy-back programme.PartyGamingslipped 5.3 per cent to 266p as concerns grew that the US mid-term elections may delay reform of online gaming laws.

KBC Peel Hunt cut Headlam to “sell” in response.
64;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-10-20T17:06:17Z;Customer service via social networks;;"When Jimmie Sanchez had a late night problem recently with the website of Best Buy, the leading US electronics retailer, the California resident turned to Twitter, the online social messaging service. “Been trying to buy a laptop (and more) on bestbuy.com for 4 days. Keeps saying “online ordering unavailable.” Don’t u want my $?”, he wrote, in a frustated message to Best Buy’s “@twelpforce” Twitter account.A Best Buy employee soon responded, apologizing for the apparent problem, and asking Mr Sanchez to send the details to the company’s customer service team. The exchange was typical of the thousands of interactions now being handled by US consumer companies, as they seek to adapt their traditional customer service operations to the rise of social media.Best Buy launched its “Twelpforce” in 2009, alongside a range of commonly found customer service tools, including phone help lines, click to chat, and “frequently asked questions” section on its website, fed by an extensive range of open customer discussion forums.Best Buy was one of the first companies to take an active position on Twitter as the medium gained prominence rapidly last year. And just two years ago, according to Thor Muller, founder of Get Satisfaction, which helps companies set up and manage social forums, “companies were largely ignoring social media”. Since then, he says, “there has been something of an arms race to embrace social media as an opportunity.”“They now see it not just as low-cost marketing opportunity through word-of-mouth, but also as a way to demonstrate their customer centricity, putting customers first.”Companies are also responding to the fact that services such as YouTube, Yelp, and Facebook allow individuals to air their complaints with new power, as demonstrated by the musician who made a music video out of his unfortunate baggage experience with United Airlines.“Customers are empowered to put those complaints on a business’ front door,” says Steve Rubel, head of insight at Edelman Interactive.Best Buy’s Twelpforce represents an unusually open approach to social media; while the account is seen by the retailer’s traditional customer service department, it also extends to a network of registered Best Buy store employees, who can pitch in at any time to offer solutions or ideas in response to customer queries.But Fiona Dias, head of strategy at GSI Commerce, an e-commerce service provider, argues that Best Buy’s high profile effort, and its democratic approach are a reflection of its particular corporate culture, and is not something that can be easily emulated by other companies.“Best Buy had already embraced a more devolved approach to its business that was unusual in the industry, so it was easier for them to accept the more open approach,” says Ms Dias.Other brands have sought instead to use Twitter to actively engage disgruntled customers, using a model most famously pioneered at Comcast, the US cable company. Starting in early 2008, and led by Frank Eliason, a customer care executive, the company began searching Twitter to find and hopefully assuage troubled customers. Last year, Brian Roberts, CEO, said the effort had “changed the culture” at Comcast, and praised Mr Eliason when he moved on this summer to become head of social media at Citigroup.The approach, with Mr Eliason and a team hunting down disgruntled Tweeters, fits into what Mr Rubel describes as a “digital embassies” approach to emerging social networking channels.“You need a presence in each major hub where your consumers are hanging out. And you need to have a community ambassador, or manager, listening and responding.”Whirlpool, the kitchen and home appliances maker whose brands include Maytag and Kitchen Aid, this year also started to make public responses online an existing effort to engage with unhappy customers. According to Brian Snyder, a senior manager of interactive communication, the company had since early 2008 been using a small customer-care team, dubbed “digital detectives”, to identify and privately contact customers who had made public complaints on social media sites.But since the complaints were dealt with privately, “it looked to anyone else that we had a user with a problem, and we were not helping them,” says Mr Snyder.The dealing with problems more publicly, he says, met with “some pushback” internally at first. “People said we were creating a new customer service channel. Our answer was that we didn’t create it, the channel had already been created by our customers.”Companies also face tensions over the way that social networks break down the traditional divisions between their customer service and their marketing departments – since social media can be used both to deal with complaints and advice, and with word-of-mouth marketing.Mr Rubel at Edelman Interactive argues the companies now have to view consumers behaviour on Twitter, Facebook, and on review sites such as Yelp “holistically”, in a way that breaks down the traditional divisions between marketing and customer service, and which can also communicate to other parts of the company as well.“The systems have to get smarter …linking those channels together is really important, and that involves deep business integration.”Mr Muller, at Get Satisfaction, points out that engaging with social networks has a dramatic impact on the way customer service departments work, since handling customer complaints or queries becomes intricately connected to the more intangible business of marketing. “Customer service teams tend to be more conservative, with metrics tending to be focused around costs per call. Now there is a wider opportunity,” he says.Meanwhile, despite the changes underway, Mr Snyder at Whirlpool says that phones still account for the bulk of customer contacts, as they do across the customer service world.“It’s small but important, and it’s growing,” he says of the volume of social networking contacts. “And we are learning things that will help us in the future.”"
65;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-09-24T01:04:38Z;Electrolux appoints first non-Swedish chief;;Electrolux has appointed its first non-Swedish chief executive to replace Hans Straberg, who is stepping down after almost a decade at the helm of the world’s second biggest home appliance maker.Mr Straberg said it was time for a change after a period of near-constant restructuring during which Electrolux survived stiff competition to emerge as the biggest global challenger to Whirlpool of the US.He will be replaced by US-born Keith McLoughlin, currently head of global manufacturing, who masterminded the revival of the company’s Frigidaire brand in North America.“This was not an easy decision to make, but I consider my mission accomplished,” said Mr Straberg.Analysts warned it was a blow for Electrolux to lose such a well-regarded leader but said Mr McLoughlin, 54, was the natural successor with a strong track record turning round the company’s US business.Ann-Sofie Nordh, analyst at Nordea, said there were no signs of problems at the company but further restructuring was needed – particularly in Europe – to keep it competitive amid continued sluggishness in consumer demand.“It seems to be a case of [Mr Straberg] not wanting to put in the extra five or six years that will be required for the next stage of restructuring, so he’s decided to hand over now,” she added.The 53-year-old Swede, who has been with Electrolux for 27 years, pushed through a series of plant closures and job losses to achieve the company’s target for 60 per cent of manufacturing to be done in low-cost countries by this year.He also oversaw a shift in the company’s product portfolio towards higher-value appliances and brands, particularly in North America.Operating profit margins increased to 5.4 per cent in the second quarter, from 3.7 per cent the year before, close to the company’s target for 6 per cent.Marcus Wallenberg, Electrolux chairman, said he was sorry to see Mr Straberg go and praised him for transforming the company, while noting that Mr McLoughlin had been “deeply involved” in the turnround.The Wallenberg family, Sweden’s best-known industrialists, are the biggest shareholder in Electrolux.Shares in Electrolux have more than doubled since the start of last year as the company weathered the global downturn better than many consumer goods makers. But they slipped back over the summer amid concerns that cost-savings had peaked while market recovery remained fragile.The stock closed down nearly 1 per cent at SKr160.40 on Thursday.North American sales registered their third consecutive quarter of improvement in the second quarter, following more than three years of decline. Mr Straberg said at the time that European markets had stabilised but were still weak.
66;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-09-20T13:36:13Z;Job hunting season begins;;The fourth and final term of SDA Bocconi’s MBA programme started at the beginning of September.This term we have more spare time left for the courses and projects. We have classes from 8:30 till 13:30. After a one-hour lunch break, we usually head back to school at 14:30 for presentations held by multi-national companies’ representatives, who present not only their company, but the worldwide job opportunities for us, SDA Bocconi MBA students.Presentations usually last for 2 hours. Some of the companies that have visited the MBA students on campus have been Johnson&Johnson, Unilever, Unicredit Group, Roland Berger, Boston Consulting Group, Bain Consulting Group etc.. After the presentations, we usually do our group projects and/or go job hunting.Every MBA student has already started panicking about finding a job (well maybe not those who already have an offer from their former companies or the companies where they did their internships.Although graduation is in December, the courses finish at the end of October. Those students on exchange programmes overseas will be arriving in Milan in mid-December since their courses will not end until then. Thus those completing the programme in SDA Bocconi in Milan do not have a lot of time left until the courses end and have already started applying and interviewing for jobs.I will be having two interviews with Whirlpool tomorrow. I did my MBA summer internship at Whirlpool’s European headquarters in Italy, but I still need to be interviewed as the position is with the Whirlpool brand, rather than the KitchenAid brand where I interned.
67;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-09-13T10:52:16Z;My summer internship experience;;As I have mentioned, I have done my three-month long MBA summer internship in the brand marketing department of KitchenAid Brand – the luxury brand of Whirlpool. I worked in Whirlpool’s European headquarters and had the chance to work with colleagues from all over the world.My pre-MBA previous full time job experience had been in a Norwegian paint company called Jotun. I had been working in the Turkish division where products were exported to countries like Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, Greece, Tunisia, Azerbaijan etc. As these units were connected to the Turkish unit, I visited these countries for marketing activities, to give seminars and presentations on products, attend industry exhibitions, set the prices for new products etc. So I am familiar with working for sales representatives from different countries.However, my experience in KitchenAid has been very useful in terms of learning about a more structured approach to co-ordinating and setting up marketing strategies for different KitchenAid business units all around Europe.I did three different projects. The first was to plan and then start up a European central call centre for European KitchenAid units where I gathered information about and the needs of European units one by one, carried out benchmarking activities, finalised the project’s business requirements, got offers from and compared different service providers, listed the activities to be conducted for implementation and then initiated the project.The second project was developing a pricing tool for the tailor-made products of KitchenAid which are designed according to customers’ needs. These products are called “islands”, stand-alone units comprising sinks, cooktops and electrical systems inserted on top and every kind of domestic appliances you could want inserted in the sides. A pricing system where KitchenAid distributors can enter data according to the needs of the customers and get an immediate price was very much needed.The final project was developing a marketing tool kit (with information gathered from the marketing department) that will become the training material for KİtchenAid distributors around Europe. This tool kit involved information about products, brand, what messages are to be communicated to customers etc. This allowed me to learn about how unique selling propositions and communication messages are created in the headquarters of a company.Overall my experience at Whirlpool taught me a lot about the functioning of a central business unit and the co-ordination of units connected to it. I have once again realised how inspired I am by marketing and how it is the right career path for me to pursue.
68;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-09-10T16:54:21Z;Welcome to the fall of 2010;;Dear MBA blog readers, I am back after a three-month summer interval. When I say “summer”, I know that some of you start imagining yourself on a beach, relaxing and enjoying yourself with a book in hand.Although I have no complaints, my summer was quite far removed from that image. I was doing my MBA internship project at Whirlpool’s European headquarters in Varese, Italy. In addition to the Whirlpool brand, Whirlpool company also consists of a couple of well-known brands such as KitchenAid (some of you might recall this brand from its famous red stand mixers), Bauchnecht, Ignis and Maytag. And the European headquarters is responsible for all these brands in the western and eastern europe, Middle East and North Africa markets.My internship was in the brand marketing department of the KitchenAid brand (or rather division) of Whirlpool Europe. KitchenAid is pretty new in Europe – especially in the major domestic appliances segment (which has existed in Europe since 2007) which consists of ovens, refridgerators, dishwashers, wine coolers, freezers etc. This brand is the luxury brand of Whirlpool with products specially designed for consumers who adopt a professional approach to cooking. Therefore the products are highly sophisticated and have unique designs.I wanted to give you some brief information about the company I worked in, not as an advertisement, but to give you a clear idea of what the company is like because I know that MBA students (either prospective or currently studying) always have post-MBA employment options at the back of their minds.In my coming blog I will tell you more about the marketing projects I worked on and what I have gained from this experience.
69;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-07-19T12:58:13Z;Electrolux hit by softness in southern Europe;;Shares in Electrolux fell more than 7 per cent on Monday amid concern that economic turmoil in southern Europe could slow growth at the Swedish home appliance maker.Electrolux said the overall European market had stabilised but reported weakening demand in southern Europe towards the end of the second quarter.The comments highlighted the risk posed to companies by fallout from the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and associated fiscal austerity measures roiling countries such as Greece and Spain.Hans Straberg, chief executive, insisted that the overall home appliances market remained resilient, with strong growth in emerging markets and a third consecutive quarter of expansion in North America, following more than three years of decline.But concerns over Europe, coupled with a mixed set of second-quarter results, raised alarm among investors that Electrolux could be losing momentum after a strong year.The company, second to Whirlpool of the US in the market for appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and vacuum cleaners, reported net profits of SKr1bn ($136m), up from SKr658m a year earlier, slightly better than analysts’ consensus forecast.But sales and operating profits came in at the lower end of expectations, with revenues down slightly at SKr27.3bn, from SKr27.5bn last year.Shares in Electrolux are up by a fifth over the past 12 months after a series of strong results highlighted the benefits of an aggressive cost-cutting programme with which much of the company’s production has been shifted to lower-cost countries.Analysts said the company, known for brands including Frigidaire, Zanussi and AEG-Electrolux, had also been successful in pushing its portfolio towards higher-value products.But the stock price rally has swung into reverse this year, with the shares down 15 per cent over the past six months amid doubts over the company’s ability to sustain the winning run.Mr Straberg told the Financial Times the outlook remained optimistic, with Electrolux on track to meet its target of a 6 per cent operating profit margin this year.He said Europe was a “mixed bag”, with demand improving in northern markets such as Germany and Sweden, where economic recovery was accelerating, while softening in the south.US sales were up 10 per cent, helped by a government rebate programme designed to promote sales of more energy efficient appliances.
70;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-05-05T17:49:57Z;Wall St down sharply, but trims losses;;"Concerns about the fiscal and political situations in Europe pushed US stock prices lower for the second day, with the Nasdaq suffering its biggest two-day loss since March 2009, but the session ended with stocks well above the day’s lows.Private payroll count in the US as calculated by ADP rose 32,000 in April compared with a revised 19,000 rise in March, boosting hopes that Friday’s non-farm payrolls figures could be in line with expectations.“It seems to me that the US markets have been looking for a reason to pull back a little for a while and the situation in Greece is an awfully good one,” said Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners, a New York-based brokerage.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent to 1,165.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to 10,866.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.9 per cent lower at 2,402.29.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, was up 6.9 per cent to 25.48, after rising earlier in the session to above 27, near the 2010 high mark that it reached in January.News Corp dived 5.2 per cent to $14.60, making it one of the session’s worst performers as its full-year outlook disappointed investors.The media conglomerate reported strong first-quarter results after the market’s close on Tuesday, boosted by the success of Avatar, a 3D blockbuster film, and by a strong performance of its cable division.The stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan with a target price of $16.50 a share.Rival Time Warner was off 2.4 per cent to $31.88 even after the company reported significantly better-than-expected first-quarter results, helped by a strong performance of its film studio and rising advertising sales at its cable network.The media conglomerate, which owns CNN and HBO networks, and Sports
Illustrated magazine, among others, earned 61 cents a share in the quarter, beating average analyst estimates of 48 cents a share.Sprint Nextel was 2 per cent higher to $4.18 as the telecoms group was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank with its target price raised from $4.75 to $6.Consumer discretionary stocks remained under pressure as investors doubted the strength of consumer confidence.Whirlpool, a consumer electronics maker, lost 4.5 per cent to $104.21, carmaker Ford was 4 per cent lower to $12.34 while Best Buy, an electronics retailer, declined 3.7 per cent to $42.90.However, lower-end retailers managed to gain ground, with drugstore chain Walgreen leading the group higher, rising 1.7 per cent to $35.73.Warehouse chain Costco added 1.2 per cent to $60.36, discount retailer Walmart was 1.4 per cent higher to $54.77 and grocery chain Supervalu climbed 1.6 per cent to $15.Garmin, a maker of portable navigation devices, lost 8.8 per cent to $34.19 after the company’s first-quarter profit came in well below Wall Street expectations, hurt by the increasing popularity of smartphones that offer navigation services.Excluding non-recurring items, earnings were 38 cents a share compared with average analyst expectations of 42 cents a share.XL Capital was one of the session’s best performers as the Bermuda-based insurer posted first-quarter profit that positively surprised investors and rose 4.8 per cent to $17.99.The company recorded net income of $143.9m in the quarter, up from $3.1m a year earlier.Drugmaker InterMune plunged 75 per cent to $11.38, making it one of the biggest fallers in the Russell 2000, a small-cap index, on news that it failed to win US regulatory approval for a lung treatment that analysts estimated could bring in more than $1bn in annual sales.Ariad Pharmaceuticals pushed 5.8 per cent higher to $4.03 as the drugmaker announced that pharma giant Merck is to acquire all development and marketing rights of Ridaforolimus, its experimental cancer treatment, for $50m cash and about $19m reimbursement of development costs.Merck was down 0.6 per cent to $35.59."
71;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-04-26T22:29:57Z;Global bourses mixed after Wall St stumble;Greek bonds fall sharply on continuing default worries;22:15 BST. Optimism over the US economy and corporate earnings encouraged traders to pick up stocks on Monday, though the rally ran out of steam at the end of the global session.The FTSE All-World equity index rose 0.4 per cent, just shy of a 19-month high, industrial metals saw demand.However, gains for the euro and European and Asian bourses were lost as further falls for Greek sovereign debt showed markets remain concerned about the chances of a default by Athens, adding to concerns over unpredictable US politics.The S&P 500 in New York was down 0.4 per cent to 1,212, with well-received results from Caterpillar and Whirlpool keeping sentiment on an even keel during most of the session, but worries about bank reform in the US and the US Treasury’s impending sale of up to 1.5bn in Citi shares knocked back financials toward the close.Many riskier assets such as stocks and commodities are at, or close to, cyclical highs. The “unloved bull market” as it has come to be known appears to have been all the more powerful because it has required a stoic stubbornness to climb a wall of worry over recent months.Indeed, one original concern, the health of the global recovery, has become a strong positive for sentiment during the past several weeks. Few could claim that economic data out of most regions have not been improving – though some may argue about its sustainability.Likewise, corporate profits have rebounded by more than expected. The current US first-quarter earnings season has for the most part been greeted warmly by analysts.The two main issues weighing on the market persist but appear to have only intermittent and minimal broader impact. The Greek debt crisis is still being treated as a containable one-off – away from the eurozone peripheral sovereign debt complex, at any rate. Investors seem reluctant to consider that the fiscal problems facing Athens are a harbinger for the fall-out from less intense, but more important, budget messes elsewhere.In addition, market optimism has not been soured by the harsher regulatory environment proposed for the financial sector – particularly in the US. For the moment it is only the likes of Goldman Sachs whose shares have been significantly affected for now.Both the fiscal and regulatory issues could yet come back with a vengeance to batter risk appetite. A sudden sharp collapse in the euro and rise in the dollar, or a downturn in global economic growth metrics, may also halt the rally.But there is one other factor that may prove crucial to whether the bulls continue to charge, and one which will feature prominently this week: monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve completes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Most analysts don’t expect a change to the “extended period” promise for low rates. However, with even the US housing market showing signs of life and stronger growth forcing peers to consider tightening (Canada will likely raise rates in June), the time is getting closer for Mr Bernanke to signal a move.Whether traders see this as a return to normal to be celebrated, or the liquidity tap being closed that will parch the bulls, may determine the market’s trajectory over the summer.“Global equity markets remain in rally mode – in the aftermath of eight consecutive weeks of gains in the U.S indices, ” said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in a note to clients.“There’s little doubt [about] the widespread confidence in the economy’s new-found verve, although the real tests lie ahead as all the stimulus from the Fed’s quantitative easing program, tax refunds and housing credits fade away.”● Asian stock markets had a good session as investors reacted to strong economic data out of the US on Friday. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index jumped 1.5 per cent, led by a 2.3 per cent surge in Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 benefited from a softer yen, which helped exporters. Sydney was closed for a public holiday.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong followed the regional trend to add 1.6 per cent as property developers rebounded, but the Shanghai Composite was typically quixotic and fell 0.5 per cent.European bourses were aided by Wall Street finishing Friday’s session at a 19-month high. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 1 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5 per cent as miners and banks forged ahead.● The euro initially added to Friday’s strong advance as traders hoped the aid package for Greece would draw a line under the eurozone’s fiscal difficulties. However, hopes for a Greek bailout have followed a similar pattern over recent months. Talk of aid on a Friday has often led to a rally, which has then fizzled early the next week as doubts about its application come to the fore.So it was that comments this Monday from Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, expressing the need for Greece to show it means business about cutting its deficit before receiving aid, again hit the euro and battered Greek debt.The single currency was flat versus the dollar to $1.3403. The dollar index, a measure of the buck against a basket of its peers, fell 0.2 per cent to 81.21 in a late swoon as bank stocks tumbled.● Greek bonds lost early gains. The yield on the 10-year note rose 74 basis points to 9.39 per cent, taking the premium Athens must pay over German Bunds to nearly 700bp. Greek 2-year notes at one point yielded more than 14 per cent, and were later trading up 285bp at 12.99 per centPortugal’s 10-year yield rose 26 basis points to 5.20 per cent, a near 8-year high as contagion worries resurfaced.US Treasuries firmed as the sell-off in eurozone “peripheral” debt took hold, their yield falling 2bp to 3.80 per cent. The US will auction $129bn of debt this week.● Commodities were mostly down on US market jitters. Copper fell 0.4 per cent to $3.35 in New York trading. However, the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodities basket, fell 0.2 per cent, dragged lower by a 0.3 per cent fall in oil to $83.93 a barrel.Gold was just about flat at $1,154 a troy ounce. Cocoa earlier in the session hit a new 33-year high of £2,368 a tonne as worries about poor supply out of the Ivory Coast met increased demand from confectioners.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm
72;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-04-26T21:41:16Z;US stocks fall on financial reform worries;;US stock prices ended the session lower on Monday in spite of a burst of merger and acquisition activity and strong earnings from Caterpillar and Whirlpool.Worries about financial reform weighed on bank shares and dragged the broader market lower.Results from a Charles Schwab survey of more than 500 of its active traders showed that bullish sentiment was sharply down.Only 28 per cent expressed a bullish outlook for the market in the next six months, down from 50 per cent in the last survey published in December 2009. About 51 per cent are neutral.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,212.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 11,205.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was lower 0.3 per cent at 2,522.95.Caterpillar rose 4.2 per cent to $71.65, making it the best performer in the Dow, as the construction and mining equipment company reported better than expected first-quarter profit, citing an improving global economy, especially in Asia and Latin America.The company also raised its full-year guidance for earnings and revenues.Appliance maker Whirlpool was up 10 per cent to $112.42 as it increased its full-year earnings guidance to between $8 and $8.50 per share, surpassing the average analyst estimate of $6.83 per share. The company also reported strong first-quarter results with net income up to $164m from $68m a year earlier.Bank stocks were lower across the board.As Goldman Sachs prepared to defend its practices in Congress this week, its stock lost 3.4 per cent to $152.03.The bank released internal documents over the weekend in an attempt to rebuff aggressive allegations from a Senate subcommittee, which suggested that Goldman had profited on the subprime meltdown just as its customers were suffering big losses.Citigroup declined 5.1 per cent to $4.61 after the US Treasury department said it had authorised the sale of up to 1.5bn of the bank’s shares as it takes its first step to offload its stake in the bank.The Treasury said it would give Morgan Stanley, its sales agent, authority to sell more shares after this initial amount as it works to sell its 27 per cent stake in the bank in an “orderly fashion”.BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, dropped 8.6 per cent to $192.95 as its first-quarter results missed expectations.Net profit was $2.40 per share compared with an average analyst estimate of $2.44.Car rental group Hertz jumped 14.1 per cent to $14.69 on news that it is to acquire smaller rival Dollar Thrifty for about $1.2bn as it attempts to boost its presence in the leisure rental market. Dollar Thrifty rose 10.9 per cent to $43.07.WuXi PharmaTech, a Chinese pharmaceutical group, added 17.1 per cent to $19.41 on news that Charles River Laboratorieshad agreed to buy the company for about $1.6bn in order to expand its global footprint in contract research and drug development services.Charles River was down 15.6 per cent to $33.55.Office Depot rose 5.9 per cent to $8.95, its highest level since July 2008, as the office supplies retailer was upgraded from “underperform” to “neutral” at Credit Suisse.Thomas Weisel Partners rose 68.12 per cent to $7.33 as the company agreed to be bought by rival Stifel Financial, a brokerage group, for about $318m in stock, or $7.60 per share.Stifel lost 2.4 per cent to $54.41.Continental Airlines rose 4.5 per cent to $22.99 while UAL Corp, parent company of United Air Lines, fell 2.7 per cent to $22.36.The two airlines are rumoured to be in merger talks with reports suggesting that they are struggling to agree on the price of a potential stock for stock deal.Shares in Texas Instruments rallied 1.8 per cent to $27.16 ahead of its earnings release after the session’s close.CKE Restaurants retreated 3.7 per cent to $12.38 after the fast food restaurant operator said it was to sell itself to Apollo Management, a New York-based private equity company, for $12.55 per share in cash, or about $694m.
73;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-02-12T15:27:04Z;Industry companies and their expectations of MBAs;;What falls under the category of “industry” according to SDA Bocconi’s Career Development Services is all those companies that provide products and services excluding consultancy companies and companies working in finance. This month is the high recruiting season of the companies that fall under this category.Last week and this, we not only had a new consultancy company, Accenture visiting SDA Bocconi premises, but also had industry company presentations such as Whirlpool, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Louis Vuitton Italy, Yoox, Vodafone Italy and Exxon Mobil.After listening to presentations of some of these companies and the information they give about their 2010 summer internship projects, I cannot help but worry about the phrase “Italian is not a must, but a plus for this position”.When I rephrase this sentence in my head, it sounds something like this: “Well as an international student you can try and apply to this position with your beginner/intermediate level of Italian, but don’t keep your hopes high.”Choosing an MBA programme in Italy, I was determined to learn Italian language before the summer of 2010. But with the intensity of the regular classes, group projects, applications etc, unfortunately I cannot spare as much time to learn Italian as I would like. And Italian has turned out to be quite a hard language after all.I will try my chances with the Italian branches of companies (some corporates visiting look for interns for the Italian branch only) anyway, while applying to positions in big corporates where they recruit interns for branches all over the world, including countries where I might have a greater chance like my home country or the UK.
74;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2010-02-02T18:17:16Z;Positive earnings lift US stocks;;Encouraging results from industrial groups and the homebuilding sector re-newed investors’ confidence in the economic recovery, pushing US stocks to a higher close on Tuesday.After a shaky start, Wall Street steadily added to its gains and the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent near its intraday high at 1,103.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,296.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 2,190.06.The benchmark index recorded its worst monthly losses for a year in January after a series of downbeat earnings reports and concerns over Chinese demand prompted a pause in the market’s 11-month rally.However, Wall Street staged a recovery on Monday after last month’s ISM data showed the strongest level of manufacturing activity for six years.”In the wake of Monday’s ISM report, people are starting to come round to a more positive view again,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.Arguing that the sell-off in the past few weeks created a better platform for the market to go higher, Mr Schweitzer said: ”Since last June, we have had five corrections on the scale of the January correction and each one proved temporary because the underlying fundamentals were getting better. We should look at January through that lens.”He added: ”The critical question is whether the fundamentals are getting better and whether they will stay better.”Lexmark led the S&P 500 higher in early trading after beating quarterly estimates because of cost cuts and increasing demand for printers and ink. Its shares jumped 12 per cent to $30.01.Shares in United Parcel Service gained 0.4 per cent to $58.62 after the world’s largest package delivery service gave an optimistic profit forecast for this year.The group, which is considered an economic bellwether of consumer demand and business activity, said that last year’s holiday shopping period had been better than expected.Emerson Electric , which makes industrial equipment, also boosted its profit forecast for this year after posting better quarterly results than analysts had been expecting.Its higher profit was largely due to cost-cutting, including the elimination of 20,000 jobs since the beginning of last year. Its shares jumped 10.1 per cent to $46.77.Whirlpool , the largest maker of home appliances, rose 8.1 per cent to $82.23 after announcing that it had doubled profit on cost cuts and higher demand.Shares in ComsysITPartners surged 31.4 per cent to $17.39 after Manpower agreed to buy the recruitment company for $17.65 per share.
75;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2009-08-09T21:31:41Z;Europe’s Roma suffer as downturn bites;;Dionyz Sahi escaped the worst neighbourhood in Slovakia’s second city of Kosice and a lifetime of unemployment thanks to a programme set up by US Steel to hire members of the Roma minority. But his escape route from poverty is now closed as a result of the global economic crisis.“We’re not in a hiring mode any more, we’re in a reduction mode,” says George Babcoke, president of US Steel Kosice, a subsidiary of the American company and the largest investor in the eastern part of Slovakia.The economic slump has hit Europe’s estimated 8m Roma, widely seen as the continent’s most economically vulnerable population, particularly hard. Many gypsies have long had trouble finding work in the formal economy and have been among the first to lose their jobs during the crisis.“Roma are the last hired and the first fired,” says Rob Kushen, managing director of the European Roma Rights Centre in Budapest. “There is anecdotal evidence suggesting that the economic crisis has affected the Roma dis­proportionately, but employment levels always were low for this group.”The effect of the crisis can been seen in the village of Velka Lomnica, in northern Slovakia. There, with the vivid green plains butting up against the snow-capped Tatra mountains, about 1,000 Roma live in abject poverty. Women lean out of windowless openings in a crumbling, three-storey block of flats, while most people live in hand-built shanties not designed for harsh Slovak winters.The nearby Whirlpool plant was forced to sack workers this year as demand for its washing machines dried up and some of those who lost their jobs live in the village. Mirko, a Roma man, says his monthly income has dropped from €650 ($922, £553) to the €130 he gets from government social support. “We eat differently now. Meat and fruit are things of the past,” he says. “People were envious of me when I had a job but now we can’t even afford second-hand clothing.”Another former Whirlpool employee says he has been calling around the country to look for another job.“I called for a job in Bratislava but they told me: ‘If you’re a Rom, don’t bother showing up’,” he says.As the crisis bites, Roma are finding it harder to compete for jobs, with employers being choosier than they were a year or two ago during the height of the boom.In Hungary, where the economic crisis has exacerbated an existing problem of deindustrialisation in the poor north-eastern part of the country, unemployment has become a particularly acute problem for Roma.Hit hard by the country's worst recession since the transition from communism, Hungarians are increasingly turning to Jobbik, a far-right party that blames gypsies for rising crime. In recent months, there have been attacks on Roma settlements, including several murders.Romania, with its much larger and better-integrated gypsy population, has had less of the violent conflict seen in Hungary in the past year, but it may have a full-blown social crisis to contend with if the trickle of Romanians returning home from Italy and Spain becomes a flood as the construction industry in southern Europe goes sour.In the Czech Republic, the atmosphere for gypsies has become so poisonous that hundreds have applied for refugee status in Canada, prompting Ottawa to re­impose visa requirements on Czech travellers.As the region struggles to extricate itself from an unexpectedly sharp economic downturn, it will probably be some time before any of his fellow Roma are able to follow Mr Sahi out of poverty. Getting the job in 2003 enabled Mr Sahi to escape Lunik IX, a grim Roma housing estate on Kosice’s outskirts. “I had never had a job before,” he says. “When I got that first cheque and took my kids shopping for toys, then I understood it was happiness to have a job.”
76;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2009-07-16T20:09:32Z;Electrolux boosted by better US signs;;Shares in Electrolux soared more than 9 per cent on Thursday after the Swedish home appliances maker reported forecast-beating second-quarter profits and said there were signs that the US market was bottoming out.Hans Straaberg, chief executive, warned there were no indications of immediate recovery in any of the group’s main markets but voiced cautious optimism that the worst could soon be over in the world’s biggest economy.“Market development continues to be weak, although in North America we see certain early signs that we are beginning to reach the bottom,” he said.Including Thursday’s surge, Electrolux shares have gained about 90 per cent so far this year after an aggressive cost-cutting programme that is helping cushion the effect of falling sales as recession-hit consumers reduce spending.Mr Straaberg stressed that the European and North American markets, which account for almost three-quarters of Electrolux sales, continued to deteriorate over the past three months and predicted further decline in the remainder of the year.But investors focused instead on the successful restructuring effort and favourable currency rates that helped generate net profits of SKr658m ($84m) – more than double analysts’ expectations.This was up from SKr99m a year ago, when the company booked restructuring costs of SKr539m.Like rivals such as Whirlpool of the US, Electrolux is shifting manufacturing plants away from developed countries to lower-cost parts of the world.At least two-thirds of the 3,000 planned job cuts announced in December have been carried out as the group aims to cut SKr1.1bn in annual expenses.“There is still more we can do,” Mr Straaberg said. “The challenge for us right now is to find the right balance between the accelerator and the brake. After the summer, we will need to build up our inventories from the very low levels we have.”Sales rose 7.4 per cent to SKr27.5bn, compared with SKr25.6bn a year ago, reflecting price increases after a rebranding effort in the US. The shares rose 9.2 per cent to SKr127.5 – their highest level since late 2007.The Stockholm-based group, which sells fridges, dishwashers and vacuum cleaners under the Electrolux, Zanussi and Frigidaire brands, was also helped by weakness in the Swedish kronor against the dollar and euro.Electrolux said it had gained market share in the North American and Latin American markets during the quarter. But Eastern European markets continued to show a “dramatic” slump in demand, with deliveries sliding 30 per cent year on year.
77;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2009-05-15T02:07:55Z;Invensys signals return of dividend;;Invensys, the engineering group that supplies controls for Whirlpool washing machines and train signalling systems for London Underground’s Victoria Line, is to make its first dividend payments since 2003.Ulf Henriksson, chief executive, said the recommendation of 1.5p a share had been set “at a prudent level which should allow for a progressive dividend policy going forward”.The company, rescued from the brink of bankruptcy in 2004 with a £2.7bn ($4.1bn) debt-and-equity rescue package after a debt-fuelled acquisition spree, would also look to use its balance sheet strength to pick up takeover targets “in the $30m-$50m range”, said Mr Henriksson.Invensys shares continued their recent rise, jumping 26.2p to 224p on Thursday.Invensys signalled a year ago that it hoped to end the dividend drought, but a worsening economy called the timing and scale of a resumption into doubt.Revenue, bolstered by sterling’s weakness, rose from £2.1bn to £2.3bn in the year to March 31, while pre-tax profits slipped from £199m to £165m.Poor demand among builders and consumer-goods manufacturers for controls and thermostats continued to hit its controls division.But orders doubled at its rail business, which recently won work on London’s Crossrail project and high-speed intercity routes in Spain, leading to a 44 per cent jump in operating profits for the division.The process systems division continued to show “resilience”.The division, accounting for more than 40 per cent of turnover, supplies software, consultancy and safety systems to customers ranging from nuclear power generators to oil and gas producers.The proposed final dividend is payable from earnings per share of 17.4p (21.1p). UBS maintained its “buy” recommendation but noted the dividend was “slightly disappointing as expectations were for nearer 2p”.The company ended the year with net cash of £309m.
78;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Haier focuses on marketing instead of takeovers;;Haier, the Chinese white goods maker that led an unsuccessful attempt to buy Maytag in 2005, has put overseas acquisitions on the backburner as it seeks to transform itself from a manufacturing to a marketing company.Zhang Ruimin, chairman and chief executive, said Haier aimed to shed most of its production in order to cut costs and quicken the pace at which it could serve customers and react to market trends.“Our strategy will be to outsource more and more,” he said, adding that the company was in talks with Taiwanese contract manufacturers that could run some or most of Haier’s factories to allow it to concentrate on developing and marketing its products.“I feel that unlike some other products, competition in the white goods sector is no longer driven by technological revolutions. So where will your competitiveness show then? In your business model,” he said.Since Mr Zhang took charge of what was a small refrigerator factory in 1984, Haier has expanded into other segments of home appliances, buying 18 factories in China and others in Japan, Italy and India.Last year, Haier, China’s largest white goods maker, had close to $18bn in revenue, he said. In 2005, Haier made an offer to acquire Maytag, the US’s third-largest white goods maker, but was outbid by Whirlpool.Mr Zhang confirmed Haier considered acquiring General Electric’s home appliances unit last year but was deterred by other companies’ failure to make cross-cultural acquisitions work.The strategy change at one of China’s most aggressive acquirers comes as Lenovo, the world’s fourth-largest personal computer company, struggles after its acquisition of IBM’s PC business four years ago and as global growth in Haier’s own industry has slowed.“So why are we getting more cautious now? One reason is that we still lack the ability to integrate the two different cultures [following a cross-border merger],” Mr Zhang said.Though the financial crisis offers opportunities for snapping up companies cheaply, “price is not the only consideration”.“There are few examples of successful mergers of big Asian companies so far. I think BenQ’s merger of [the handset arm of] Siemens failed because perhaps there were huge differences in their business model,” he said. “I hope to first establish a more competitive business model of our own, then mergers will work better.”
79;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2009-02-09T21:47:11Z;Wall Street flat after rescue delay;;US financial stocks enjoyed reasonable gains during the most subdued session of the year so far as traders remained reluctant to place bearish bets on banks before the Obama administration unveiled plans to shore up the stricken sector.Regional banks did particularly well, helped by an upbeat note on Regions Financialfrom Richard Bove, influential Ladenburg Thalmann analyst.He noted that current valuations suggested “investors do not believe that this company will survive”, yet went on to argue that “despite all of its faults and scars, this company has a dominant franchise in a good banking market and it should recover from the current economic downturn”. Regions Financial leapt 10.5 per cent to $4.64 while regional banks rallied 4 per cent overall.Some insurers also enjoyed strong gains and the sector added 1.8 per cent overall.The wider market struggled for momentum after it emerged that Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, would not disclose the bank rescue proposals until Tuesday.The market drifted between positive and negative territory during the narrowest trading range for the benchmark S&P 500 so far this year.Alan Ruskin, senior analyst at RBS’s global banking and markets division, wrote in a note to clients: “Because the devil will be in the detail of the newest measures, notably the purchase of toxic assets, I would expect that the rally in risk appetite we are seeing ahead of the plan will lack immediate serious follow-through.”The S&P 500 finished 0.2 per cent higher at 869.89 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.1 per cent lower at 8,270.87 and the Nasdaq Composite Index flat at 1,591.56.“Traders left their desks on Friday all bulled up over Monday’s line-up,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers. “The postponement of Mr Geithner’s plans until Tuesday doesn’t instill confidence that whatever his team’s plan delivers will be much more than a compromise.”Meanwhile, another round of downbeat earnings illustrated the toll that the recession was taking on US corporations.“The known uncertainties of earnings are now mixing with the unknowns of both the Treasury Department’s plan for the banking sector and the government’s stimulus package,” wrote Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.In financials, Nasdaq OMXwas hit in the fallout from poorly received fourth-quarter results from NYSE Euronext. Shares in the exchanges lost 6.3 per cent to $23.34 and 5.2 per cent to $21.71, respectively.Among the results elsewhere, Whirlpool added 2 per cent to $37.13 in choppy trade despite the appliance-maker unveiling a worse-than-expected 76 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profitThe energy sector, up 0.2 per cent overall, provided the market with some support early in the session but later tracked the oil price lower.Meanwhile in materials, Dow Chemical shed 2.1 per cent to $10.65 after HSBC said the group was likely to cut its dividend, downgraded its view of the stock to “underweight” and warned a debt-financed deal to buy Rohm & Haas could prompt a credit rating downgrade. For its part, Rohm & Haas – locked in a merger dispute with Dow – edged 0.1 per cent lower to $55.47 on glum fourth-quarter results.Coca-Cola was among the losers in soft drink stocks, down 2.9 per cent to $42.31 after Citigroup cut its price target from $53 to $51.“While headline risks remain for the US soft drink industry,” wrote Celso Sánchez, Citi analyst, several factors could “increasingly garner investor attention and support sector valuations”.Homebuilders came under pressure after Citigroup downgraded its view of Lennar, off 6.3 per cent to $8.71, to “hold”. The sector lost 4.9 per cent overall.Motorola bucked a downward trend in the telecoms sector, helped by news that its co-chief executives had snapped up battered shares in the group last week. Its shares climbed 7 per cent to $4.15.Also on the upside, General Electric was a key winner, bolstered by hopes that GE Capital would benefit from bank bail-out plans.GE shares rallied 13.9 per cent to $12.64, helping the industrial advance 2.6 per cent overall.
80;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2009-02-09T16:51:26Z;Whirlpool profits plunge;;Whirlpool, the world’s largest home appliance maker, said on Monday that its fourth quarter profits plunged 76 per cent as consumers retrenched.Earnings fell to $44m, or 60 cents a share, down from $187m, or $2.38, in the same period the prior year. The results trailed analysts’ expectations for profits of 78 cents a share in the last quarter.”The severity and scope of the global economic downturn has significantly increased over the last several months and had a significant impact on consumer demand in all parts of the world,” Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool’s chief executive, said in a statement.The Michigan-based company’s performance was dragged down by higher costs for materials, foreign exchange fluctuations and a $32m product recall due to a quality issue with a supplier. Whirlpool was also hit with $77m in restructuring charges.Fourth quarter sales were off by 19 per cent to $4.3bn. Sales were down by 18 per cent in North America, down by 16 per cent in Europe, down by 26 per cent in Latin America and slipped 10 per cent in Asia.Last October Whirlpool said it would cut 5,000 jobs, or 13 per cent of its workforce, as it cut costs to cope with weak demand. At that time it also announced that it would close five production plants.For the year in 2008 Whirlpool’s profits fell to $418, or $5.50 a share, down from $640m, or $8.10 a share the year before. Sales were off by 18 per cent, to $18.9bn, from the previous year, while he company burned through cash, with free cash flow declining by $101m after generating $521m in 2007.Whirlpool said it further cost cutting measures could be in store as the company faces economic conditions “among the most challenging that we have faced.” Industry unit shipments are expected to be flat or down by 5 per cent this year and the company predicts earnings from continuing operations to be between $3 and $4 per share.Mr Fettig said in a conference call with analysts that the company expects raw material costs to rise by $200m this year. To combat this, he said the company will work to redesign its products so that they can be made with less materials and simplified components. It will also reduce capital spending in 2009 by up to 15 per cent.Last quarter Whirlpool, which makes KitchenAid and Maytag washers, dryers and refrigerators, tapped its $2.2bn credit facility. It said on Monday that it was in discussions with banks to seek greater “flexibility within its capital structure”. Whirlpool has $247m outstanding on the revolving credit facility and confirmed that it has complied fully with its bank covenants.In January Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, cut Whirlpool’s outlook to negative, citing diminished discretionary consumer spending. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s slashed the company’s rating to one notch above “junk” status, on expectations of continued weak demand.Shares of Whirlpool fell 2.56 per cent to $35.46 in late morning trading on Monday.
81;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2009-01-20T18:35:18Z;Invensys slides 8% on ‘lower demand’ warning;;Invensys, which supplies control products to items ranging from washing machines to nuclear power stations, saw its shares slide as it gave downward guidance on profits and warned of a deterioration in demand.Shares in the company, which was promoted to the FTSE last autumn following an absence of six years, on Tuesday closed down 12.6p, or 7.73 per cent, at 150½p.The technology and engineering systems company, which confirmed a $250m (£170m) order to install control rooms for four reactors at two Chinese nuclear power stations, said overall orders in the third quarter since September 30 had held up well in its rail group and process systems divisions.But weakening demand at its controls business – which supplies manufacturers such as Whirlpool and Electrolux – prompted it to give downward guidance on second-half profits.It said second-half performance would be “broadly in line with that achieved in the first half”. Brokers, which had been forecasting an advance on interim profits of £88m on turnover of £1bn, cut their full-year earnings forecasts by 6-7 per cent.Invensys’s controls business – which contributes about a third of group turnover – was hit as manufacturers and builders cut inventory levels.Its rail division continued to trade strongly. But Invensys pointed to concerns over its industrial automation businesses, which generates more than half of its turnover. “Process systems’ markets, especially oil, gas and power, [will] remain generally stable but in the short term we are likely to experience further delays in both project and product orders,” it said.The company also confirmed the departure of Paulett Eberhart, appointed chief executive of Invensys Process Systems a year ago. She will be replaced temporarily by Ulf Henriksson, group chief executive.• FT CommentIn these dark days of global slowdown, various fans on Tuesday maintained that, in the case of Invensys, weakness was an opportunity. They also argued that its “estimate capitulation is likely to be helpful”, and its trading statement was “better than our worst-case scenario”. But ensuring a steady second-half performance will rely on the flattering effect of currency translation. Poorer trading prospects could delay the likelihood of ending a suspension of dividends since 2002 following several years of painful restructuring. A modest forward price-earnings ratio of about seven and net cash of £238m point to long-term upside. But a recovery may require a move towards dividend resumption by its board in May.
82;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2008-10-28T21:00:21Z;Wall St gains strongly despite grim data;;"US equities soared on Tuesday, rebounding from the heavy losses sustained in the previous two sessions as investors snapped up battered stocks in spite of a fresh glut of grim economic data.Throughout the session, swings in the S&P 500 were tightly correlated with moves in the exchange rates of the euro and dollar against the yen. That suggested widespread selling of yen positions had left traders with cash to invest in US stocks.After a wave of buying into the New York close, the S&P 500 finished up 10.8 per cent to 940.50. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 9.5 per cent to 1,649.47 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.9 per cent to 9,065.12.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 16.3 per cent, although at 66.99 continued to indicate heightened levels of distress.The market’s late afternoon surge came even after figures showed consumer confidence slumped to a record low in October, which Ian Shepherdson, of High Frequency Economics, described as “extraordinarily awful.” Separate data showed prices of single-family homes plunged by a record percentage in August.Energy and telecoms were two of the biggest sectoral winners. Exxon Mobil and AT&T were among the biggest blue-chip winners, up 13.3 per cent to $74.86 and 13.2 per cent to $27.61 respectively after analysts at Morgan Stanley highlighted their “defensive” qualities.Relatively well-received results from refiner Valero helped the energy sector. Its shares jumped 11.3 per cent to $16.81.Materials overall gained 12.7 per cent. US Steel’s third-quarter results were also positive and the shares jumped 14.2 per cent to $35.20 even after a downbeat assessment of prospects for the fourth quarter.The financial sector remained volatile, with large swings, particularly in the value of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Despite early losses, Morgan Stanley closed up 10.7 per cent at $15.20 and Goldman shares ended up 0.7 per cent at $93.57.Phil Orlando, strategist at Federated Investors, said sentiment was also helped by the continuing efforts by the US government to implement measures to help the financial sector. “There’s a recognition that these programmes will be successful [in the long term],” he said.Traders also took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and the market is pricing in a 50 basis point interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.Wal-Mart jumped 11.1 per cent to $55.17 after the world’s largest retailer told analysts it was “well-positioned” to deal with a global slump.In industrials, Boeing climbed 15.5 per cent to $48.91 on the prospect of a tentative deal to end a strike.General Motors advanced 14.7 per cent to $6.25 on reports that the hard-hit auto group was pushing for government aid to help a possible merger with
Chrysler.Meanwhile, internet stocks were in focus after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on several in the sector. “We are cautious on US display advertising,” the analysts wrote. “Investors should position their portfolios toward what we see as more sustainable growth in search and fixed-price e-commerce.”Google was up 11.9 per cent to $368.75 after Credit Suisse placed an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $400.Airlines were a key winner, up 4.3 per cent overall. The sector was helped after Calyon upgraded a slew of stocks due to “dramatically falling oil prices and the deep capacity cuts implemented to support ticket prices and revenue, which sharply reduced variable and fixed costs”.Bucking the market’s upward momentum, Whirlpool lost 8.3 per cent to $45.87 after the group slashed its full-year outlook and said it would cut 5,000 jobs by the end of next year.Britannia Bulk Holdings plunged 85.8 per cent to 27 cents after the group said there was a “very high risk” that it would default on a $170m loan.Visa and MasterCard rose 7.3 per cent to $49.97 and 7.7 per cent to $136.01, respectively, after the duo agreed to pay $2.75bn to settle an antitrust lawsuit with

84;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;The lost decade;;"The S&P 500’s earnings season is in full swing, but for US equity investors, the outlook is hardly clearer than it was a month ago.Investors who made short-term punts on financial stocks in the past fortnight could have made a killing, or been killed, depending on the day of the bet: financial shares had gained more than 20 per cent in 10 days, and then on Thursday suffered their worst fall since 2000. At such times it is tempting for amateur day-traders to ride the roller-coaster. That temptation is worth resisting: bear markets are unforgiving playgrounds.For the longer-term investor, a mixed earnings season has provided little information. Few investors, anyway, are setting too much store on recent earnings. Commodity companies are enjoying windfalls that may or may not be repeated. Bank results are viewed with suspicion, because too much lies beneath the surface to provide great confidence. For the record, they were awful, but not as awful as investors had expected.Outside those two headline-grabbing sectors, the news has perhaps been mildly better than expected – a statement that owes as much to expectations as to any true signs of recovery. Some bellwether companies such as Costco and American Express disappointed; others, such as Whirlpool, provided more reasons to be cheerful.What is a patient investor to make of it all? There is as much reason as ever to recommend the time-honoured strategy of gradually buying a diversified portfolio of stocks and then holding them for the long haul. In fact, there is more reason than there has been for half a generation. Such a strategy, a no-brainer in the 1980s and 1990s, has looked less robust since then. The past 10 years have been a lost decade for US equities: the S&P 500 has recently been at risk of falling below the levels of a decade ago; it is already well down on where it was in 1999 and 2000. Total returns have failed to beat inflation over the past decade. This is not the bill of goods that patient investors thought they were buying.But that can hardly be surprising. By 1999, it was clear to the few remaining level-headed stock-watchers that the ratio of price to long-term earnings was not just high, but far higher than it had ever been before. From such heights disappointment, even over the long term, was all but inevitable.It is too soon to call the bottom of the bear market, despite a cheerier couple of weeks. And yet: equities have been too expensive for much of the past 10 years. There is at last the prospect that may change."
85;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2008-07-23T21:39:09Z;Wall Street advances as oil prices drop;;US stocks advanced for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices dropped sharply and lawmakers moved closer to a deal on legislation to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Crude oil prices fell back for a second day, slipping below $125 a barrel and helping to offset some mixed earnings reports from consumer-oriented companies.In the consumer discretionary sector, Whirlpool shares added 12.5 per cent to $76.69 after the appliance maker said second-quarter profits had fallen less than expected. The sector advanced 2 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, Costco Wholesale said earnings would be “well below” Wall Street expectations as it had absorbed some recent hikes in energy prices to attract customers. Costco fell 11.9 per cent to $63.43. Wal-Mart Stores slid 1.6 per cent to $58.09 while Kroger lost 2.3 per cent to $28.18.There was some better news from PepsiCo and McDonald’s, which both beat analyst estimates for their quarterly results.PepsiCo rose 2.3 per cent to $67.72 but McDonald’s slipped 0.8 per cent to $59.66. The sector rose 0.5 per cent.In industrials, Boeing, the aerospace group and CH Robinson, the logistics provider, both undershot Wall Street expectations while Norfolk Southern, the railway company, outperformed.Boeing and CH Robinson fell 3.7 per cent to $66.72 and 15.6 per cent to $49.56, respectively. Norfolk, however, added 6.5 per cent to $69.96, helping the industrial sector advance 1.1 per cent.Seven of the 10 leading industry groups closed in the black, nudging the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.4 per cent at 1,282.12 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 11,632.38 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent ahead at 2,325.88 points.On Tuesday, stocks overturned early losses to surge in late trading after oil fell back and the new chief executive of Wachovia announced a turnround plan, prompting a powerful rally in banks.Financials climbed for a second session on Wednesdsay as lawmakers prepared to vote on a bill that would authorise the Treasury secretary to inject capital into the two government-sponsored entities if needed with only limited restrictions as part of a broader package to address the housing crisis.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, said: “The power of [the] blank cheque is huge in terms of restoring confidence in the major players of the mortgage market – Fannie and Freddie. Just having that there is psychologically very important to the market.”Fannie Mae climbed 11.9 per cent to $15 and Freddie Mac added 11.3 per cent to $10.80. The financial sector added as much as 4.6 per cent before paring gains to 1.9 per cent.Amid the positive sentiment, investors could not overlook poor results from Washington Mutual. The largest US savings and loans company, said it had lost $3.33bn in the second quarter, significantly more than forecast.Washington Mutual shares, which have lost about 88 per cent of their value in the past year, slumped 20.1 per cent to $4.65.The technology sector was also in focus. Overnight, Yahoo said second-quarter profits dropped 18 per cent to $131.2m on higher development costs and declining advertising spending.The company also reduced its full-year revenue forecast and the shares dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.39.EMC, the maker of storage-computers, was the leading sector gainer, however, surging 13.7per cent to $14.17 after it posted estimate-beating second-quarter profits and boosted its 2008 sales target. The technology sector advanced 1.4 per cent.Telecom stocks were the best performers on Wednesday. AT&T, the telephone carrier, said second-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent to $3.77bn, helping the shares to advance 3.9 per cent to $33.06 and the sector to add 3.4 per cent - its biggest one day gain since late January.As oil prices dropped, energy stocks were again a weak spot in spite of some solid earnings from ConocoPhillips. The third-largest US oil producer posted a record $5.44bn second-quarter profit thanks to soaring gas and oil prices. Still, investors were not satisfied and the shares fell 2.9 per cent to $81.83. The sector dipped 3.8 per cent
86;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wall Street shrugs off US jobs data;;US equity markets made tentative gains on Thursday but only pared losses for the week after shrugging off data showing that the US shed jobs for a sixth straight month in June and the services sector contracted unexpectedly.According to the US Department of Labor, 62,000 jobs were eliminated last month, largely in line with analysts’ expectations.Analysts noted that there was little cause for optimism on the economy. The unemployment rate, which in May jumped by the most in two decades, remained at 5.5 per cent and non-farm payrolls have now fallen by 438,000 in the first half of the year.Separately, data showed initial jobless claims hit a three-month high last week, while the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index fell sharply in June.But equity markets proved resilient as traders bet that the poor jobs data would reduce the chance of an interest rate hike from the Fed.Industrial and material stocks were among the leading gainers, adding 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively as investors bought back into some of the most heavily sold sectors.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage, said: “Historically, we tend to rally before a patriotic holiday. The major players have already gone home, volumes are light and the path of least resistance is up.”Markets closed early on Thursday and are shut on Friday for the Independence Day holiday. The benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,262.90 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 at 11,288.54 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,245.38 points.Over the shortened week, higher oil prices knocked markets. The Dow and Nasdaq slumped into bear market territory before the Dow recovered slightly, while the S&P 500 touched its lowest level since July 2006.The S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent over the week and has now declined for five weeks in a row. The Dow Jones fell 0.5 per cent over the week.Technical analysts warned that, having broken through the psychological support of the March lows, the S&P 500 could retest its 2002 depths.Kevin Edgeley, a technical analyst with Goldman Sachs, said: “US markets have been oversold since early June but, in an impulsive trend like this, give no reason to buy.”But investors did just that by, in particular, picking up beaten-down industrial stocks. Ingersoll-Rand added 2.9 per cent to $36.65 while Paccar climbed 2.4 per cent to $40.80.Materials snapped a three- day losing streak as steel producers bounced back. US Steel rose 1.6 per cent to $155.80 and Nucor added 1 per cent to $62.54.Even consumer-facing stocks seemed unfazed by the macroeconomic data. Consumer discretionary stocks added 0.3 per cent while consumer staple stocks rose 0.7 per cent.Safeway and Campbell Soup rose 2.5 per cent to $28.74 and 2.5 per cent to $34.68, respectively, while Kohl’s and Whirlpool climbed 3.4 per cent to $42.52 and 3 per cent to $62.69.Energy stocks were among the biggest fallers however, dropping 0.5 per cent, with refiners taking some punishment. Sunoco fell 3 per cent to $39.69 while Tesoro lost 1.6 per cent to $18.98.In corporate news, NVIDIA tumbled 30.7 per cent to $12.49 after the visual computing technologies provider said second quarter sales would be well below analysts’ estimates.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said that there were some encouraging signs that equity markets might be nearing a bottom. The volatility index has moved higher in recent days, the percentage of stocks trading at or below their 200 day moving averages has increased, and energy and materials stocks have come under pressure.“While this may be seen as a problem for investors,” Mr Levkovich said, “we would stress that any weakness in the commodity and energy space can be helpful to other areas that have been crowded out by momentum-driven trading.”Still, Mr Kinahan warned that there were more losses to come. “This has been the most orderly down move of all time. Wednesday was the first sign of panic. We have further to go on the downside as we have never set a bottom until people have said ‘I have to get out at any price’.”
87;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2008-06-17T20:54:52Z;Goldman chills Wall Street with warnings;;New York stocks fell on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs both soothed and spooked markets, with second-quarter results that handily beat expectations while its analysts argued that continuing losses and writedowns may force US banks to raise $65bn of extra capital.Goldman said profits fell 11 per cent to $2.09bn, but that was well ahead of consensus estimates as gains in commodities and prime brokerage offset losses elsewhere.The results had little impact on the broader financial sector, however. It slipped 2.9 per cent after a number of analysts, including some at Goldman, wrote downbeat notes on investment banks and cut their targets for regional banks.Analysts at Strategas Research said: “We find it difficult to envision how the majors will be able to put the earnings machine back together in the near-term and therefore it is not time to wade back into the investment banks.”The latest batch of data on housing, industrial production and inflation also weighed on sentiment.Housing starts fell 3.3 per cent to a 975,000 annual rate in May, knocking the S&P 500 homebuilding index down 1.4 per cent.New figures on industrial production also made for sober reading. Large industrials such as Boeingfell back after the Federal Reserve said production slipped 0.2 per cent in May.Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index, a key inflation measure,jumped by a higher-than-expected 1.4 per cent in May due to surging energy prices, although core inflation moderated as forecast.Financial markets have suffered in recent weeks as rising inflation has stirred fears that the Fed will start raising interest rates.However, some remain optimistic on the outlook for monetary policy and equities. David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “We continue to expect that in an environment of increased uncertainty, US equities will outperform. The hawkish noises from the Fed seem to us much more an exercise in expectations management than a warning of an imminent tightening.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,350.93, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 12,160.30. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,457.73.Financials were in focus again on Tuesday after the Goldman results. Of the leading brokerages, Goldman has stood up best to the credit crunch. So far this year its share price has lost about 16 per cent of its value compared with a 29.3 per cent loss for the S&P 500 investment banking index.Goldman shares fell 1.5 per cent to $179.44 on Tuesday while its peers for the most part dropped back. Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent to $29.24 and Lehman dropped 7.6 per cent to $25.14.Zions Bancorp was the biggest sector faller, tumbling 8.6 per cent to $33.97,. The Salt Lake City-based lender was pummelled after it said further increases in bad loans were “likely”.In the consumer discretionary sector, data showing a small increase in weekly chain store sales initially boosted retailers. Analysts attributed the gains to demand for hot weather merchandise, Father’s Day shopping and federal tax rebates.Gap shares rose 0.3 per cent to $18, while Coach added 0.1 per cent to $33.37. But disappointing results from Best Buy and poor appliance sales data for May, which hit Whirlpool, helped drag the sector down 1.3 per cent. Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $43.46 and Whirlpool dropped 3.5 per cent to $66.03.Homebuilders and industrials also came under pressure. Lennar dropped 4 per cent to $15.28 and KB Home lost 3.5 per cent to $18.34, while United Technologies gave up 0.7 per cent to $68.41 and Boeing fell 0.9 per cent to $74.38.Commodity-related stocks were among the few gainers. Energy rose 1.7 per cent as refiners bounced back and bid speculation pushed shares in Marathon Oil3.1 per cent higher to $53.07. Materials added 0.2 per cent, led by Monsanto, which gained 5 per cent to $142.69.The healthcare sector initially made ground after Elan said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug helped some patients. Elan shares added 10.7 per cent to $30, while Wyeth, Elan’s US partner, rose 4.8 per cent to $45.16.But losses for healthcare providers swamped those gains. Humana dropped 3.3 per cent to $44.87.
88;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2008-05-05T19:50:16Z;A little imagination...;;"When companies proclaim their commitment to innovation, they are usually referring to new technology, products, research and strategic thinking. Seldom do they talk about innovation in management: yet this may be the most important kind of all.Management innovation matters because new technology and products are more easily replicable and competitive advantage thus gained is quickly lost. Innovations in management systems and practices, on the other hand, are much harder to imitate.Gary Hamel (pictured below), a professor at London Business School, believes that today such advances are few are far between. “Real innovation in management has slowed to a crawl.”Speaking last week at a meeting sponsored by the Management Lab and Advanced Institute of Management at London Business School, Prof Hamel contrasted the modern situation unfavourably with the early 20th century, when innovators such as Frederick Winslow Taylor were pioneering new ways of managing businesses. Later in the 20th century came some other famous examples, such as the Toyota system and total quality management.Today, says Prof Hamel, when executives are asked to imagine new ideas in management, “they mostly come up with structures that are familiar from their own businesses, and have difficulty imagining structures that are different from what they know”. Managers need to wake up to the importance of this issue before it is too late, he adds.Julian Birkinshaw, another LBS professor, cites examples of management innovation including the balanced scorecard, which enable companies to look at performance in different ways. Another is what he calls the “blowing up of budgets”, the replacement of budgets with more flexible guidelines on spending and performance.According to Jeremy Holt in his book Reinventing the CFO, this not only saves time – in some firms the budgeting process can take as long as three months – but it also encourages innovation. Budgets, says Mr Holt, often act as a straitjacket: the guiding principle becomes “we can’t afford it because it’s not in the budget”, and this prevents people from acting creatively.Where should innovation begin? Prof Hamel and Prof Birkinshaw believe that, whereas previous advances focused on processes, the management innovators of today must concentrate on people. This is as true of start-ups as of big companies. Prof Hamel says that companies “need to learn how to use employee imagination”.At IT training firm Happy, the most important metric is not financial performance, or even customer satisfaction, but emplo­yee satisfaction. Managers say that if employees are happy they will create happy customers. Managerial and technical functions are kept separate. Happy has some of the highest customer satisfaction rates in its industry.Whirlpool, the US white goods and appliance maker, set out several years ago to make innovation everyone’s job. “There was no best-practice model,” says Prof Hamel. “No benchmark that anyone could follow.”Every business process, from marketing to finance, was examined with a single question in mind: how could this process become a catalyst for innovation? Whirlpool set up a bulletin board where staff could post their ideas for innovation. It also began measuring success by number of new products introduced each year as well as financial performance. The company is now rated one of the most innovative in the world.Customers can also get involved in the process. Danish toymaker Lego has been using customers as a source of innovation for several years, says Torben Pedersen, a professor at Copenhagen Business School. As a result, the boundaries of the firm have started to blur. Lego fans now combine features of both customers and suppliers. Some new products are even labelled “created by Lego fans”.Proof that even the biggest companies can innovate in this way comes from IBM, which launched its “Innovation Jam” in 2006, posting dozens of white papers and internal documents online and inviting comment.“Everyone got involved in discussing IBM’s strategy,” says Prof Hamel. “Customers, suppliers, employees, family members of employees.” The result was 10 initiatives and hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.But the majority of companies are failing to realise similar benefits. Part of the problem lies in how managers are trained and educated. “Most managers are not taught to think of themselves as people whose job it is to create and invent,” says Hamel. But businesses too must play a part, giving people the tools of creativity and encouraging their use.Most people are fundamentally creative, he adds: the evidence can be seen in their homes, their gardens and their hobbies.“Then when they get to work, they are somehow expected not to be creative. We need to get the organisation out of the way, and let people bring their creativity
to work.”"
89;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2008-04-24T20:48:38Z;Wall Street rally led by financials;;Wall Street stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday as financials led markets higher and investors picked out the positive in a mixed batch of earnings reports.The day began in gloomy fashion as cautious outlook statements from several corporations, including Apple and Amazon, stirred fears of a consumer-spending slowdown.Materials and energy stocks, which have supported equity markets for much of the past few weeks, had their worst day in over a month, following commodity prices lower in spite of strong results from industry leaders.But an unexpected rally in financials helped wipe out those declines thanks to upgrades and strong results at a handful of insurance companies.Homebuilders contributed to the turn in sentiment after the National Association of Home Builders said the US housing market would begin to recover in the third quarter, brushing aside new data showing sales of new homes slumped in March.The benchmark S&P 500 erased losses of as much as 0.6 per cent to close up 0.6 per cent at 1,388.82 while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1 per cent higher at 2,428.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,848.95.Financials advanced 3.8 per cent on Thursday, their biggest gain since the start of the month, as investors looking for a bottom to the market rotated out of energy stocks and into the downtrodden sector. T Rowe Price, the fund manager, led the gainers adding 11.8 per cent to $60.24 after posting its 20th straight quarterly increase in earnings.Insurers Travelers and Aflac added to that revival, climbing 4 per cent to $50.23 and 4.1 per cent to $67.76, respectively, after both beat first-quarter estimates and raised their full-year forecasts.Investment banks also made ground after the chief executive of Merrill Lynch said the firm would maintain its dividend. Merrill Lynch added 7.1 per cent to $48.09 while Lehman Brothers rose 6.2 per cent to $46.38.James McGlynn, portfolio manager of the Summit Everest Fund, said: “There was so much uncertainty going into the earnings season, people thought financials were going to drop another shoe, so the stocks have perhaps been overly discounted.”Mike Mayo, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said: “The crises now seems closer to the end, albeit with lingering uncertainty related to monoline insurers, CDO dispositions and short-term money markets.”As oil slipped off its highs and the dollar rallied, giving consumers more wiggle room, JC Penney climbed 3.5 per cent to $41.97 while Macy’s added 5 per cent to $24.36.Ford led the consumer sector higher after the car group unexpectedly swung into profit in the first quarter as reduced costs offset weak US sales. Ford jumped 11.7 per cent to $8.40 while rival General Motors added 5.6 per cent to $22.11.Companies reliant on discretionary spending had initially found it hard going after several bellwethers cut forecasts and were sold by anxious investors.Starbucks tumbled 10.4 per cent to $15.99, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, slid 10.1 per cent to $73.89 and 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $79.25.Homebuilders helped the advance. Lennar added 7.9 per cent to $18.38 while Pulte Homes rose 5.4 per cent to $13.81.In technology, too, early despair gave way to enthusiasm. Better-than-expected results and forecasts from LSI pushed the sector into the black. The maker of storage chips advanced 20.8 per cent to $5.99.By the close, Apple, which added 15 per cent in the month running up to the results, was 3.7 per cent higher at $168.94. Amazon fell 4.1 per cent at $77.69.Energy and materials stocks were a drag on indices. Gold producer Newmont Mining said first-quarter profit rose fivefold thanks to record prices for bullion but its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $42.94, mimicking the pattern of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold on Wednesday. Freeport shares fell 3 per cent to $112.61 while energy groups Chevron and ConocoPhillips dropped 2.2 per cent to $92.40 and 1.8 per cent to $82.96.Industrials rose after Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, and Goodrich, the aerospace components maker, posted better-than-expected results. Goodrich shares jumped 9.7 per cent to $67.66 while Northrop climbed 4.4 per cent $72.55.
90;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2008-02-05T21:41:32Z;US stocks tumble on service report;;"Wall Street stocks tumbled on Tuesday after an index of service sector activity slumped to its lowest level since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, accentuating fears for the health of the US economy.The extremely weak non-manufacturing data caused stocks to record their worst performance in almost a year as traders priced in a greater likelihood of a domestic recession.All ten of the S&P’s leading sectors closed in negative territory with financial, energy and telecoms companies leading the rout.The S&P 500 closed down 3.2 per cent at 1,336.64, its worst day since February 27 last year when the index fell 3.5 per cent. A broad-based sell-off saw only 16 index members end in positive territory. The S&P has now declined 9 per cent in 2008, its worst start to a year ever.The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.1 per cent to 2,309.57 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.9 per cent - or 370 points - to 12,265.13.The equities slump was accompanied by a spike in the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – which jumped 9 per cent to 28.33.The ISM non-manufacturing index recorded its biggest fall in its history, plunging to 41.9 last month from a reading of 54.4 in December. It was the first contraction in service sector business activity since the start of the Iraq war and the lowest reading since October 2001.“This data release corroborates the notion that the US economy is in recession,”
T.J. Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said.Economists were expecting only a small pullback to 53.5, where a reading above 50 indicates expansion.Some analysts were more sanguine, noting that such a dire reading could be a contrarian indicator and investors should therefore buy into market weakness.“The three worst readings in non-manufacturing ISM occurred in 2001 [twice] and 2003. In two of three instances, equity markets rose three months later, with an average gain of 6 per cent,” Thomas Lee, strategist at JPMorgan Research, said.Bond prices rose sharply and the yield curve steepened as traders speculated that the Federal Reserve would keep slashing interest rates to head off a severe economic downturn.Sheryl King, economist at Merrrill Lynch said the dismal data meant there was a strong chance of an inter-meeting rate move before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in March. The futures market priced in a 76 per cent likelihood of a 50 basis point cut in March and a 24 per cent chance of 75bp.Financial stocks came under pressure after Fitch Ratings said it might downgrade some of the safest triple-A rated collateralised debt obligations by as much as five notches.Meanwhile in a report on bond insurers Standard & Poors said there could be serious ripple effects if monolines lose their triple-A ratings, including possible credit downgrades for US banks. S&P said $125 billion of subprime-related CDOs hedged by bond insurers were concentrated at a small number of banks. “Few banks have disclosed how much that exposure is,” the rating agency said.Among the biggest fallers were Citigroup, down 7.4 per cent at $27.05 and Merrill Lynch, 5.6 per cent weaker at $54.50. GMAC Financial Services, the finance company owned by Cerberus Capital Management and General Motors, reported a preliminary net loss of $724m for the fourth quarter.Also retreating sharply was Goldman Sachs, down 5.5 per cent to $189.86, after Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney cut her rating from “outperform” to “perform”, citing valuation concerns. Ms Whitney said Goldman would “suffer from its own success” as it faced tough earnings comparisons this year.Homebuilder stocks initially rallied after Banc of America Securities raised its rating on four companies citing expectations that lower house prices would increase demand. That mood had dissipated by the close as the S&P homebuilder index fell 4.9 per cent.In the technology sector, National Semiconductor, down 7.5 per cent at $17.59, spurred a sell-off in chip stocks after it lowered its third quarter revenue outlook because of expected weakness in mobile electronics sales. The PHLX semiconductor sector index fell 3.7 per cent.Earnings news was led by NYSE Euronext, whose shares fell 14.1 per cent to $71.03 as concerns about its ability to realise anticipated cost savings worried investors.The exchange operator more than tripled quarterly net income to $156m.Whirlpool was a lone bright spot, soaring 10.3 per cent to $90 after the appliance maker increased quarterly earnings by 72 per cent. News Corp, up 0.6 per cent at $20.08, which increased fourth-quarter profit 1.2 per cent to $832m."
91;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2008-01-28T05:50:44Z;Jobs: Keep an eye on the storm clouds;;Business schools are keeping their fingers crossed that the credit squeeze affecting markets has not caused severe damage to the MBA recruitment scene, even in the financial sector.The September 2007 round of full-time recruitment – for MBA programme participants graduating this year – generally went well, with descriptions such as “surprisingly robust” coming from the schools’ careers services staff.But there is a sense of nervousness when it comes to predicting the final outcome of the September round as the on-campus presentations and opportunities have to be turned into real job offers, some of which may not be made until the following year.And there are concerns, too, over whether the effects of the credit squeeze could spread beyond the financial sector and into the general economy, which may take the wind out of MBA recruiters’ sails.“The career horizon is bright, but everyone needs to keep their eye on the storm clouds,” says Joseph Palumbo, executive director of the career development centre at York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto.At Columbia Business School in New York, the main message from Regina Resnick, managing director of the school’s career management centre, is cautious optimism.“We are being very attentive to the marketplace and sensitive to what is going on,” she says. “We are continuing to reach out aggressively to [an ever wider range of] recruiters, and are reminding students not to put all their efforts into just one market but to look for opportunities across a range of industries and functions.”In Europe, Diane Morgan, director of career services at London Business School, says she detected a general feeling of nervousness in September and October: there were some indications that students were prepared to accept an offer earlier than usual. On the other hand, LBS had more company recruiters on campus than ever, “so the nervousness felt by everyone was not necessarily matched by a decrease in opportunities”, says Ms Morgan.Companies’ longer-term recruitment concerns are still a priority, irrespective of the events of July and August. “There is a recognition that these are associate-level programmes that are recruiting leaders of the future,” she says.There remains, too, a shortage of leadership within organisations, says Mr Palumbo, and this puts a premium on MBAs with five to 10 years of experience who can be leaders straight away. He adds that companies are struggling to find the right people, and as a result behaved quite differently last year: “They are getting more aggressive, investing more in their brand on campus, trying to get here sooner and to recruit in more innovative ways.”Some of the largest employers turned up on campus in the third week of August, the earliest ever, and before even the students had arrived, says Mr Palumbo.One sector that was continuing to show a strong interest in MBA recruitment during the September round was consulting, says Ms Resnick at Columbia. There were also more consumer packaged-goods companies on campus compared with the previous year, and more companies offering marketing opportunities.At New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, there were growing opportunities in strategic consulting at the top firms, according to Pamela Mittman, assistant dean of career services. There was also growth in a variety of industries with which NYU Stern has an advantage because of its location, such as retail and luxury, and media and entertainment.“We have been building relationships with the media industry for some time – but some of the retail and luxury and technology recruiters were new [to the full-time recruitment round],” says Ms Mittman. The school has been working hard at building links with these sectors, she says, while the students themselves have been doing a “terrific job” building relationships with the retail sector.LBS, too, saw a broadening of interest from the consultancy sector, with smaller, specialist firms wanting to engage with the school through jobs postings or careers fairs, complementing the regular presence of the Big Four and the mid-sized firms.In industry, there has been a greater diversity of companies engaging with LBS, says David Morris, business development manager in the careers services department. Nike, the US sports shoes and apparel group, came to the school for the first time last year, hiring MBAs for its new European management programme.Manufacturing also put in “a bit of a comeback”, says Ms Morgan, with companies such as Danaher, the diversified US technology products company, and Whirlpool, the US white goods company, coming to the school. “We are seeing interest on the student side in general management posts at companies making tangible products,” she says, “and that is matched by the interest of the companies themselves [in recruiting MBAs]”.In North America, healthcare organisations are starting to wake up to the need for MBA recruitment, says Mr Palumbo, following behind the pharmaceutical sector. Hospitals and medical businesses represent a huge opportunity for MBAs, he says.Another fast-growing area for MBA recruitment in North America is related to sustainability, says Mr Palumbo. Interest in this was previously limited to sectors with a direct impact on the environment but this has spread to others such as banking and consulting, where advisers on sustainability are in demand.The internship round can also provide indicators on the health of the MBA recruitment scene and the confidence of students. Ms Resnick says a very high percentage of second-year students came back from their internships with job offers. However, she adds, there is anecdotal evidence that the volatility of the markets convinced a number to accept the offers more quickly than normal – rather than going to more interviews later in the year.The next pointers will emerge through February and March as the recruitment of this year’s interns is completed. Schools are reporting a normal, or even higher, level of interest from recruiters in booking slots for on-campus presentations or attending career fairs.“There has been a significant increase in on-campus interviews over last year, and that is excluding all of the off-campus contacts arranged by less traditional recruiters,” says Ms Mittman at NYU Stern. “The students seem pleased and the recruiters seem exceptionally happy. One interviewed 26 students in one day, and said it would be happy to hire 22 of them, if it were able to extend that many offers.”The big question for MBA recruitment over the coming months is posed by Mr Palumbo: “Will the slowdown spread from wholesale banking to other parts of banking and then to all other parts of the economy as credit gets tighter?”If that were to happen soon, the recruiters that have been delaying making offers – whether through caution this year or because they prefer a “just-in-time” approach anyway – could decide not to hire at all.Ms Mittman says some of the non-traditional recruiters that base their hiring on need will continue to make job offers in March and June anyway.But she does not think the traditional recruiters – the investment banks, consulting and consumer packaged goods companies that determine their numbers quite early – will postpone their decisions.“It may happen that recruiters will choose to limit the number they hire, then come back to recruit again,” says Ms Mittman. “We have seen that happen in years where there has been uncertainty. But so far there is no indication that they won’t hire as many as in the past. All of us are aware of what is happening in the markets, but we haven’t seen any effect on campus.”
92;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2007-11-08T19:48:57Z;Newton at heart of US trade policy debate;;A day after the last Maytag washing machine rolled off the production line in Newton, Iowa, last month, John Edwards, the Democratic presidential hopeful, was introduced at a campaign event in nearby Des Moines by one of the factory’s former workers.Doug Bishop recalled taking his young son to meet Mr Edwards at a campaign rally in 2004, when the former senator was running for vice-president. “I’m going to keep fighting for your daddy’s job,” Mr Edwards told the boy, after hearing about the threat facing the Maytag plant. “I promise you that.”It was a fight Mr Edwards was never likely to win. Maytag, facing pressure from low-cost foreign competition, was sold last year to Whirlpool, its US rival, and Newton was among the list of plants to close in the resulting consolidation.Maytag was founded in the town 114 years ago and was its biggest employer, with a 3,000-strong workforce out of a population of 16,000 until recent cuts.As presidential candidates converge on Iowa ahead of the state’s crucial first-in-the-nation nominating contest in January, Newton has found itself at the heart of an intensifying debate over US trade policy. Democratic candidates have seized on the Maytag closure as evidence that international trade has become rigged in favour of global corporations, the Wall Street elite and China, at the expense of middle-class Americans.“The statistics today say our economy is growing, that the economic tide is rising,” said Mr Edwards at the Des Moines event. “But if you look around, the only thing rising with it are the yachts.”There is a problem, however, with using Newton as a political prop. Visit the town and it becomes clear that its population is unwilling to accept the role of victim. Instead, Newton is aiming to become a case study in US economic resilience.Less than a month after Maytag closed, the company’s former headquarters and call centre have already been occupied by new tenants and there have been at least 60 expressions of interest in the manufacturing facilities, according to Chaz Allen, mayor of Newton.Mr Allen says the town is also close to clinching a deal with TPI Composites, a Rhode Island-based wind turbine manufacturer, to build a plant that would create up to 700 jobs.“Losing Maytag was like the death of a parent,” says the mayor. “It’s traumatic but you have to move on.”Newton had been seeking to diversify its economy for several years as it became clear that Maytag’s future was shaky. A $70m (£33m, €48m) speedway track was built to expand the hospitality industry, and incentives were provided to attract new businesses and encourage local entrepreneurship. Nearly 300 jobs have been created over the past year and Mr Allen predicts that all 3,000 of those lost at Maytag will be replaced by 2010.“We were smart enough to start reinventing Newton long before Doomsday,” says Nancy Watt, owner of Uncle Nancy’s, a popular downtown coffee shop, adding that the town had become unhealthily dependent on its most significant employer. “There were opportunities lost because Maytag didn't want to share the workforce,” she says.While competition from China and elsewhere played a part in Maytag’s demise, Mr Allen says local anger has focused on alleged mismanagement rather than globalisation.Kimberly Didier, executive director of Newton Development Corporation, complains that presidential candidates have shown little interest in the town’s efforts to bounce back. “They have been using Newton as a campaign platform. But none of them have really reached out to find out what's going on,” she says.A range of support services has been provided to help laid-off Maytag employees find work, including free training, consulting and market research for those interested in starting their own business.At least one promising new venture is already rising from Maytag’s ashes. About 50 of the company’s former engineers have created their own research and development business, called Springboard, ensuring that some of Newton’s most skilled residents will remain in the town.Not everyone, however, will adapt to life after Maytag as easily as its former engineers. Unemployment in the Newton area has climbed from 3.1 per cent in 2001 to 5.6 per cent – above both the state and national average – and most remaining jobs offer lower wages and benefits than those paid by Maytag.“The mayor has to project optimism,” says Craig Wade, a 57-year-old lifelong Newton resident, sipping coffee in Uncle Nancy’s cafe. “But it has to hurt when a town of this size loses so many high-paying jobs.”Ms Watt concedes business has been slow at the coffee shop this year as laid-off workers cut spending, but she insists that Newton will emerge stronger in the long run. “This town is going to survive,” she says. “It's going to do just fine.”
93;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2007-11-07T20:54:22Z;US retail price pressure;;Up to now, US retailers have largely avoided the rising input costs that have sliced their suppliers’ profit margins. But the shop owners may have to bite the bullet.Wholesale prices for all finished goods, excluding food and energy, have risen more quickly than retail prices in the past three months, reversing a favourable pricing trend that had boosted retailers’ margins for two years. The core producer price index for finished consumer goods rose 2.4 per cent year on year in August and 2.3 per cent in September, outpacing the core consumer price index for both months.Historically, manufacturers tend to absorb their own increased production costs at first. Higher energy and raw material prices have put margins under pressure all year at companies from Whirlpool to Coca-Cola. But now that it is clear that the rising costs are more than temporary, many manufacturers have started boosting wholesale prices. The data series does not include the cost of goods sourced overseas. But the mismatch between producer and consumer price inflation suggests that retailers are absorbing more of the pain.With consumers worried about the health of the US economy and the holiday shopping season at hand, many retailers are offering unusually large and early discounts to stimulate demand. On the manufacturing side, commodity input prices remain inflated. Pressure on retailer profits is likely to intensify before it improves.This could be good news for consumers – especially if last month’s surprisingly robust employment numbers really do show that the economy is holding its own in the face of the credit squeeze and housing downturn. But with holiday price-cuts already pasted across newspaper circulars, some retailers may be sacrificing their profitability in search of greater sales. For the next few quarters investors should beware focusing too hard on revenue growth. Margins will be the key.
94;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2007-11-07T02:43:38Z;Jersey Pottery: Success is a mug’s game;;Jersey Pottery is hardly a start-up – it has been in the Jones family since 1953. But every few years it has faced the challenge of changing direction to cope with changing markets.This has been so successful that it is now one of the few Jersey-owned businesses operating internationally. Its ranges of beautifully illustrated tableware and home accessories are so well-known in the industry that it is simply referred to as Jersey, in the same way as experts refer to Doulton or Wedgwood.When the grandfather of the present owners started the business, items were sold mainly to the UK market, where the production of fancy goods had been prohibited after the war. But the business really took off with the boom in the tourism industry in the 1960s and 1970s, when Jersey used to attract nearly 1m staying visitors a year.Tourists could see potters at work in attractive grounds near Gorey Village, buy a locally-made mug or a vase and have a cup of tea and a sandwich.However the tourism industry went into decline in the 1990s and now attracts fewer than 300,000 staying visitors. So the Jones family expanded the catering side and the Jersey Pottery now has one of the most popular restaurants on the island, along with cafés and an outside catering business that has grown as the finance sector has expanded.Visitors can still watch the potters at work at Gorey, but although they produce £100,000 ($208,772) worth of items a month, this is dwarfed by the fast-growing sales of pottery the Jersey company makes and sells overseas.“Our external business is up 57 per cent this year, partly due to the new designs we’ve launched, partly due to new distribution agreements with people like Dartingtons, and partly due to new contracts,” says Jonathon Jones, managing director.The company recently won contracts with both Aga and Whirlpool, and has 380 outlets in the UK, including Harrods and John Lewis. There are distribution agreements in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and Mr Jones is now seriously looking at doing business in Russia.While design and price are crucial, Mr Jones believes product quality has also helped the company’s success.“We’re just about to start producing a bone china mug with a decoration on it for £6. You could get something for £3 or £4 made in the Far East, but people don’t want that any more. It’s changing massively from the Far East to manufacturing in Europe,” he says.“Also, while other producers would use a four-colour process, we’ll use 12 or 18 colours, which looks much better.” This concentration on quality helped Jersey Pottery win the Gift of the Year award from the UK Giftware Association this year.Apart from Jersey, the pottery is manufactured in the Czech Republic and Portugal and the distribution centre is in the UK, but the management, marketing and selling is done from Jersey.There is very little government support for local businesses in the Island, although Mr Jones has benefited from an enterprise initiative that helped the company exhibit in the UK and Frankfurt.“English companies have tremendous support from their government, and we would probably be better off commercially if we were based [in the UK], but we’re a family business and we want to stay in Jersey and continue to invest in the island,” says Mr Jones. “None of us wants to leave.”

96;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US results point to weaker economy;;US companies on Tuesday underlined the resilience of their international operations but failed to dispel fears that the slowing domestic economy would weigh on future earnings.Third quarter results released by a raft of large US groups showed that the weaker dollar and global economic growth are helping parts of corporate America to cushion the blow of the housing downturn and liquidity squeeze.The chemical maker DuPont became the latest company with large overseas sales to report strong profit growth and a bullish outlook for next year.The company said that, although it expected the US housing market to remain depressed in 2008, profit growth would come from rising international demand, particularly for its agricultural products.The stock market took heart from DuPont’s comments, as well as strong results released by Apple and American Express on Monday after the closing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.16 per cent higher in midday New York trading, while the S&P 500 was also in positive territory.However, Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, saw its shares slip five per cent after missing analysts’ estimates on weak US sales and issuing bearish predictions for the near-term future of its domestic business.Meanwhile, UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, predicted that domestic retail sales would rise at its slowest pace in four years.Scott Davis, UPS chief financial officer, who is to become chief executive on January 1, told the FT that high energy prices and falling housing prices are “bound to put pressure on the consumer”.However, UPS said a gradual rebound in industrial production would quicken the pace of US economic expansion to around 2.5 per cent in 2008.Other companies, such as the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, have been less sanguine, warning the economy was heading for a recession.Unlike its arch-rival FedEx, which cut its earnings forecasts for the rest of the year due to the slowing US economy, UPS expects to earn $4.13 to $4.19 a share in 2007, within the range of estimates provided to investors at the start of the year.
97;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2007-10-22T16:09:41Z;Electrolux adopts cautious outlook;;Electrolux, the world’s second-largest maker of household appliances, cautioned investors on Monday that a decline in demand in the US and rising costs in Europe could undermine full-year profitability.The bearish forecast came as it reported third-quarter results that fell mildly short of analysts expectations, sending shares in the Swedish company down nearly 8 per cent to close at SKr129. The guarded statement from one of the world’s leading white-goods makers highlights how the downturn in US demand and global rises in prices of materials such as steel can weaken leading exporters.Electrolux said sales rose by 1.1 per cent to SKr26.4bn ($4.05bn) compared with the same quarter last year and reiterated its forecast “that operating income in 2007 is expected to be somewhat higher than in 2006”.But it remained open to question what it meant by “somewhat” after it added: “The risk for further decline in the US appliance market, continued raw material cost increases and cost pressures on our European margins add uncertainty to the accomplishment of the 2007 outlook.”In spite of the company’s elliptical language, a twin downturn in both its leading markets bodes badly. Electrolux generates about half of its sales in Europe and one-third in North America.Dresdner Kleinwort, the investment bank, said a new product range should allow profit margins to expand in the future but added that the combination of a US slowdown and slackening demand in Europe were worrying. It lowered its price target from SKr170 to SKr140.“The company experienced a weakening of the German, UK and Spanish markets,” it said in a report. “This, in our view, represents the greatest risk to [the] 2007 full-year and 2008 numbers.”The Swedish company’s products include refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, cookers and washing machines sold under its own brand as well as AEG, Zanussi and Frigidaire. Its main competitor is Whirlpool, the US company and world number one, which reports results today.Electrolux is hoping that a plan to boost efficiency will offset the potential effects of a slowdown. It involves using cheaper labour and sourcing parts from low-cost countries. It has shifted labour away from its home market of Sweden to countries such as Poland and Mexico. It expects to report savings of between SKr2.5bn and SKr3bn by 2010.
98;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Caterpillar results deepen fears of slowdown;;Caterpillar deepened fears of a US economic slowdown on Friday when it reported a sharp fall in profits, missing Wall Street estimates, due to weakness at its North American operations.The heavy equipment and truck engine maker, a bellwether for the US economy, saw its shares fall nearly 10 per cent during the day, despite recording record sales for the quarter and issuing an upbeat assessment of its international operations.The stock, which had reached an all-time high on Thursday, ended 4.4 per cent down at $83.20, contributing to a 1 per cent slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.The unexpectedly weak performance of Caterpillar’s US operations come amid growing worries that the problems in the domestic housing market could spill over to the rest of the economy.The company admitted the 21 per cent fall in profits was “disappointing” and blamed it on problems in the diesel truck market, weakness in US sales of heavy machinery, higher material costs and continued disruptions to its supply chain.However, the Illinois-based group boosted its forecast for full-year sales, saying that its international operations, which account for about half of its turnover, would grow 25 per cent this year.It reaffirmed its target for full-year profit but said it had “more work to do on costs” and hinted that it might rein back capital expenditure.Caterpillar’s mixed outlook reflects the increasing discrepancy between a slowing US economy and booming international markets.A number of large US manufactures such as General Electric, Honeywell and Whirlpool, the white goods maker that also reported results on Friday, have been relying on exports to offset a slowdown in the domestic market.The US manufacturing sector has been weighed down by a 20 per cent reduction in house building, partly offset by rising non-residential activity, and weak demand in the auto sector.However, analysts said the higher-than- expected June report of the ISM index of manufacturing activity suggested that domestic business conditions were improving, while overseas sales remained strong.In the three months to June, Caterpillar reported net profits of $823m, compared to $1.04bn in the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.24, well below analysts’ expectations of $1.49 per share. Sales rose 7 per cent to a record $11.36bn in the June quarter, with full-year guidance of $44bn at the top end of its existing range.
99;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2007-04-27T20:37:03Z;Wall St steadier following GDP jitters;;A fresh batch of strong earnings updates pushed Wall Street stocks to historic highs this week, but the advance remained more symbolic than substantial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 13,000 point threshold for the first time on Wednesday, in a move heralded by bulls as a sign of good times ahead.Yet the technical breakthrough came amid a listless week for the broader S&P 500 index. The benchmark index closed 0.7 per cent higher this week after falling slightly on four out of five days. The Dow rose 1.2 per cent this week.The Dow closed 0.1 per cent up on Friday at 13,120.94 while the S&P 500 was 0.2 points lower at 1,494.08.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,557.21.“It has been a week where the Dow has caught up with the S&P, they are now both up over 5 per cent for the year to date,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co.“The market has been celebrating earnings and upbeat guidance.”The indices were led upwards by companies such as Whirlpool and 3M that were boosted by a weak dollar and strong growth overseas. Railway and steel stocks, which are more exposed to the US economy, fared less well.Microsoft broke through the $30 mark for the first time since the launch of the Vista operating system to stand up 3.5 per cent to $30.12 on Friday. But overall investor sentiment was subdued by data showing economic growth slowing.This came towards the end of one of the best months on Wall Street for more than three years. The Dow rose 6.2 per cent in April, but the gains were driven by a relatively narrow base. About half of the gains were made by just eight of the 30 Dow component stocks.The steady rise in stocks has made it a testing month for short-sellers. Amazon, for instance, rose 36.9 per cent to $61.50 this week after entering April with short selling of its stock at the highest level since 2003.While the surge was sparked by a strong earnings report, the jump was partly explained by the unwinding of loss-making short positions.With more than two-thirds of the company’s shares held by a handful of investors, many short sellers looking to buy the stock may have found it hard to come by.Baker Hughes, the oil services group, was one of the biggest risers this week, up 11.7 per cent to $81.01.Like many other US groups reporting during the week, Baker was boosted by strong overseas sales. Whirlpool rose 17.6 per cent to $106.41 in spite of a US housing downturn because of strong appliance sales abroad.Meanwhile 3M, the Post-it Note maker that generates the majority of its revenues overseas, rose 4.9 per cent to $81.55 on strong profits.Railways and steel, two sectors that surged this year amid a burst of takeover speculation, began to lose some of their shine.The S&P Rail index, which is up 19.9 per cent this year, fell 3.5 per cent this week amid signs of weak traffic volume. CSX fell 2.9 per cent to $43.74.Profit updates from a number of steel groups undermined hopes that the steel cycle was on the up. US Steel slipped 3.6 per cent to $103.04 while Nucor fell 4.1 per cent to $64.94.Apple surged 9.8 per cent to $98.92 after handily beating analysts’ profit estimates as sales of Macintosh computers rose strongly.Texas Instruments gave upbeat guidance on chip demand, sending its stock up 7.2 per cent this week to $34.83. But relatively positive sentiment towards the sector began to wane on Friday.Broadcom plunged 4.2 per cent to $33.40 on Friday after the chipmaker fell short of analysts’ sales forecasts.JetBlue Airways slipped 3.6 per cent to $10 after JPMorgan described the group as “the most expensive airline money can buy” as it cut its rating on the company from “neutral” to “underweight”.JPMorgan reduced its recommendation on a total of six airlines, including US Airways and Continental, citing concerns about over-supply and weaker demand.Pressure on General Electric to pare its operations increased on Friday after Citigroup advocated selling the conglomerate’s NBC Universal media division.Jeffrey Sprague, a Citigroup analyst, said the group “needs to be more focused” and should sell NBC because it had “no meaningful synergy with the rest of the portfolio”.Shares in GE, down 1 per cent this year, rose 2.8 per cent to $36.84 on Friday.

Shares in homebuilders and retailers fell sharply.By midday, however, the main market indices had recovered, led by technology stocks. The relatively measured market reaction to the downbeat economic news encouraged some analysts.“I’m impressed that the market has held up even though the magnitude of the decline [in home sales] was pretty large,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.“I’m not a fan of weather-related excuses but in this case people are holding out to see the pattern over a longer period.”The S&P 500 index closed flat at 1,480.44. Boosted by gains IBM, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent at 12,953.94.Meanwhile, the technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 0.03 per cent to 2,524.54.Most companies reporting on Tuesday beat profit estimates and raised their earnings guidance, according to Bloomberg data.“There has been more good earnings news than bad,” said Mr Hogan. “The guidance in particular is catching us by surprise.”The technology sector showed patches of strength.Texas Instruments jumped 7.7 per cent to $34.92 after the group overcame a glut of inventory to beat profit forecasts. In one of the first optimistic sets of remarks about demand for microchips this year, the group added that it expected better sales ahead.Piper Jaffray upgraded its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”, citing improved margins and a better product mix.The guidance lifted other chipmakers, including Nat­ional Semiconductor, which rose 4.3 per cent to $26.91. Meanwhile, SanDisk, the flash-memory maker, rose 4 per cent to $43.54.Some analysts remained guarded. “We caution investors from getting too bullish on the overall semiconductor cycle,” said Credit Suisse in a note to clients.“Demand and supply-chain dynamics continue to point to a muted recovery.”The Dow was led up by IBM, which gained 3.5 per cent to $98.49 after the computer services group raised its dividend and said it was buying back $15bn of its stock.AT&T reported a doubling of first-quarter profits to $2.8bn, beating estimates in its first full quarter since the company bought BellSouth. But its shares slipped 1.7 per cent to $39.10 after the number of its new subscribers disappointed.Housebuilders’ stocks fell after data showed the biggest year-on-year fall in existing home sales for 18 years. DR Horton pared early losses to stand 0.3 per cent lower at $22.53.The S&P Homebuilders index, which approached its lowest level in almost three years earlier this month, has dropped 16.6 per cent
this year. Retail groups were also under pressure after Target, the discount chain, said its sales were much weaker than expected in April.Its shares slid 1.8 per cent to $60.33. Rival Wal-Mart fell 0.5 per cent to $48.69.Steel stocks suffered after downbeat guidance from US Steel defied hopes that industry sales would imp-rove in the second quarter. US Steel slid 3.7 per cent to $103.04, while Nucor slipped 2.7 per cent to $66.71.AK Steel bucked the trend, rising 4.2 per cent to $30.99, after it reported a 10-fold jump in profits.IPSCO, which is in talks that could lead to the sale of the company, slipped 0.5 per cent to $151.48 after its earnings disappointed analysts.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Evraz, the Russian steelmaker."

Net income for its second quarter rose from $1.4bn to $1.9bn and revenues were expected to grow by 19 to 20 per cent in the third quarter. Shares in Cisco were trading up 2.97 per cent at $28.09.Shares in Broadcom jumped 4.7 per cent to $33.50 after analysts at Morgan Stanley lifted their recommendation on the chip-maker.In deal news, the fierce battle to acquire Equity Office Partners was won by Blackstone, the private equity group, after rival bidder Vornado Realty Trust withdrew its cash and stock offer to buy the commercial property group. Shareholders in EOP voted to accept Blackstone’s $39bn cash offer, sending EOP down
1 per cent to $55.45. Meanwhile Vornado shares rose 6.9 per cent to $135.75.Shares in Whirlpool were down after the household appliance maker reported fourth-quarter profits below expectations and cut its guidance on earnings for 2007.

102;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2007-02-07T17:48:55Z;US housing slowdown affects Whirlpool;;Whirlpool on Wednesday forecast that sales of large household appliances in North America would fall by 2-3 per cent this year, highlighting the impact of the slowdown in housing activity on the broader economy.The world’s largest household-appliance maker by sales also cut its earnings guidance for the year to reflect the lower demand from builders, a more depressed replacement market and the impact of rising raw material costs.The group’s outlook is more pessimistic than most forecasts following a 1 per cent fall in industry-wide shipments of fridges, stoves and laundry products in the US during 2006, though international markets are expected to continue their expansion.The pressure on the domestic appliance market follows similar warnings from home-improvement retailers and building-material suppliers about the impact of a US housing market, which many analysts do not expect to bottom out until the second half of this year.Whirlpool and General Electric are viewed as the most exposed to the US housing market, with sales to homebuilders accounting for as much as a fifth of their domestic business. Whirlpool expects housing starts to fall by 15 per cent this year, with existing-home sales down in the “low single digits”.Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool chief executive, said industry-wide sales could fall as much as 5 per cent in the first six months of the year before recovering in the second half, with global demand expected to rise about 2 per cent during 2007.The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers currently forecasts a 4 per cent rise in US shipments, and more depressed conditions could affect the expansion plans of manufacturers such as Electrolux and LG Electronics.Whirlpool has cut a net 3,000 jobs in a bid to improve productivity following last year’s $1.7bn acquisition of Maytag, its smaller rival. It has pruned some product lines and sold loss-making units such as the Hoover floor-care business to improve margins.Analysts also noted that Whirlpool’s push into higher-margin equipment at the top end of the market could leave it vulnerable to market-share losses from lower-priced rivals in Asia.The company cut its 2007 guidance for earnings per share from $9 to $8-$8.50, partly to reflect higher copper, zinc and steel prices. Record sales and earnings from its international divisions helped push earnings from continuing operations up from $126m to $133m in the three months to December 31, with full-year profits rising from $422m to a record $433m, or $6.47 a share.
103;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;India’s small stores braced for challenge;;Wal-Mart on Monday pulled ahead in the battle between the world’s largest retailers to set up shop in India, one of the last great markets virtually untouched by international retailers.A partnership with Bharti Enterprises, one of India’s largest business groups, should soon see the two companies roll out hundreds of stores under the Wal-Mart brand.The deal represents a defeat for Tesco, which pulled out of talks with Bharti last week after a year of talks. Carrefour, the French retailer that led the western retail charge into China, remains largely on the sidelines, while Germany’s Metro has focused on wholesale stores selling to local businesses, with two open so far in Bangalore.Wal-Mart will have to make significant adjustments to its usual business model to adapt to Indian regulations, which currently bar international retailers from direct participation in the market.The retailer will not be able to own any of the stores bearing its name, but is expected to opt for a franchising arrangement with its local partner, a model it has previously used only in small and unsuccessful ventures in Indonesia and Hong Kong in the 1990s.The US company is expected to supply its own expertise in supply chain and brand management, and will probably plan to increase its stake in the venture as and when FDI restrictions are relaxed.Its Indian operations are likely to be headed by Raj Jain, a former Whirlpool executive who was appointed this year as president of emerging Asian markets, excluding China.The retailer already operates a “research” office in India. As part of those efforts, Mike Duke, the head of its international division, spent time earlier this year visiting potential customers in their homes to better understand buying behaviour.Bharti and Wal-Mart will make a formidable combination. One is the world’s largest retailer, while the other is the quintessential symbol of the entrepreneurial drive that has put Indian business on the global map in the last 15 years.For India’s 12m “mom and pop” stores, the deal represents the news many have been dreading for well over a year. Millions of small shops across India provide a social safety net for a section of the country’s poor, serving as a last-resort source of jobs for many low-skilled workers coming off the land.Allowing in Wal-Mart through the back door will test the government’s determination to open the economy. By some estimates, the Indian retail sector is worth $250bn, roughly a third of India’s entire gross domestic product.With sales of more than $312bn last year, Wal-Mart benefits from massive scale economies and an ability to procure globally, squeezing suppliers.Indian “mom and pop” stores, by contrast, tend to be below 50 sq ft in size, run from stalls and mobile handcarts and scattered across more than 5,000 towns and 600,000 villages. They are adept at holding the political class to ransom.“Over the next two-three years, the development in the retail sector may not have a significant impact on the existing mom and pop shops,” says Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya. “However, in the medium term, as the reach of chain stores increases, some adverse impact on mom and pop shops is inevitable.”He added that he expected the emergence of the organised retail sector to create new jobs for a different section of the lower middle class in distribution and other sectors. “The lower middle-class also stands to gain from higher productivity [in the form of lower inflation] benefit that the organised retail sector offers.”But their territory is under threat from domestic business groups too. Apart from existing players, such as Pantaloon, many large business groups, including Reliance Industries and Birla Group, have announced their intention to cumulatively invest billions of dollars over the next five years in retail.Wal-Mart has been lobbying aggressively for liberalisation, including a meeting last year between Mr Duke’s predecessor and prime minister Manmohan Singh. The retailer already sources extensively in the country.This is an important consolation for the Indian government, which is keen to improve the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector ahead of further trade liberalisation and to integrate textiles, apparel and toys sectors with global just-in-time supply chains.Morgan Stanley economists say the emergence of widespread organised western-style retailing will increase productivity, lift declining agricultural growth rates and reduce inflation, which is currently running at well over 5 per cent.
104;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-11-08T15:27:00Z;Introduction: Playing the tune of shared success;;"The chairman of BMW’s supervisory board, Joachim Milberg, once declared: “Those who work alone can only accumulate, but those who collaborate intelligently can multiply.” The comment was in relation to the development of the company’s X3 sports utility vehicle, which was developed in collaboration with Magna Steyr/SFT.The goal of achieving a result that is greater than the sum of the individual parts, – the “multiplication effect” – has long been recognised in business, and creating win-win relationships with partners is a key driver. This reflects a recognition that business is no longer about competition at all costs, but that organisations are being forced to collaborate and partner with other companies to gain competitive advantage.The term collaboration covers a broad range of different ways organisations can work together. Work by Douglas Lambert at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University with organisations such as McDonalds, Xerox, Ryder, 3M and Whirlpool and their key partners, identified the following types of relationship: arms length relationships, through what are defined as type one, two and three collaborative partnerships; joint ventures; and vertical integration.Type one collaborative partnerships are where companies recognise each other as partners, and co-ordinate and plan activities on a limited basis. The partnership is short-term and involves one division or a limited number of functional areas in each business.Type two collaborative partnerships see partners moving beyond the co-ordination of activities to the integration of them. This relationship has a long-term horizon but is not expected to last for ever. In this case, multiple divisions and functions within each company are involved.Type three collaborative partnerships occur when the companies share significant levels of operational integration. Each organisation views the other as an extension of its own business, an end-date is not usually set and the relationship is seen as permanent.The requirements for maintaining these different types of collaborative relationships differ substantially in terms of planning, contract style, communications and operational controls. For example, it may not be possible to have a type three relationship with every partner, but selecting the appropriate type of collaborative relationship with a business partner is becoming a major source of competitive advantage.Collaboration can also take place between competitors, a form of alliance called “co-opetition”. This can occur when neither company is able to enter a market on its own. For example, beer makers Heineken and Guinness build breweries together in developing markets to produce both products. Carmakers Ford and Volkswagen co-developed and manufactured the original Ford Galaxy, Seat Alhambra and Volkswagen Sharan people carriers. The advantage to those involved in co-opetition is that a category or market can be developed at lower risk to each organisation.Maximising internal collaboration is also critically important. It is often thought that relationships within an organisation are stronger than the relationships with external actors. Conventional thinking says: “If we are all within the same company we should all collaborate together successfully.” But the reality is that internal relationships are often worse than external relationships. What is more, the internal relationships can be treated with contempt with functions trying to gain advantage over each other.In a survey of 500 organisations in the US, published in the International Journal of Logistics, interdepartmental relationships were shown to result in reduced cycle times, better in-stock performance, increased product availability, order-to-delivery time and customer improvements. Those organisations which collaborated well internally had performed better in terms of meeting customer needs, accommodating special customer requests and introducing new products. As a result, customers had a better perception of the organisations which, in turn, led to increased sales and margins.To create a win-win relationship there are two key dimensions that need to develop. The first is what I call “C3 behaviour’: a combination of co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration. C3 behaviour involves working together to achieve effective operations in harmony with the strategies and objectives of both parties.The second dimension is trust. Trust helps companies to integrate micro-level psychological processes and group dynamics with macro-level institutional arrangements. In other words, it entails dispositions, decisions, behaviours, social networks and institutions. Trust enables co-operative behaviour, promotes improved relationships, reduces harmful conflict and allows effective responses to crises.Managers need a new skill set to develop these ideas into collaborative relationships. In addition to technical ability and intelligence, organisations need to embrace the so-called “soft skills”. For example, when building a collaborative relationship, social skills, empathy and motivation are of high value.A survey by the Society of Human Resource Management illustrated the importance of emotional intelligence in achieving competitive advantage. The researchers analysed a series of top companies, selected for profitability, cycle times, volumes and other key performance measures. They found that the companies which had performed best had the following competences in managing their human assets: organisational belief and commitment to basic strategy; open communication and trust building with all internal and external stakeholders; an interest in building relationships inside and outside the organisation where they offered competitive advantage; collaboration, support and the sharing of resources; an environment where innovation, risk taking and learning were promoted; and a passion for competition and continual improvement.Foundations for success and failureI recently conducted a study of more than 60 collaborative relationships and identified a number of factors for success:• innovative commercial practices, tough but achievable incentives and meaningful gain share;• end-to-end, clearly visible performance objectives agreed by all supply chain players including the end-customers;• frequent, interactive, open communications across all levels of the customer/supplier interface especially on performance reviews and continuous improvement of products/services and business processes;• open, no blame culture aimed at customer and relationship satisfaction which depend on personal, trusting relationships;• joint planning and business systems supported by free-flow of information.In contrast, those relationships that were typified by failure exhibited the following types of behaviours and practices:• lack of stable customer funding arrangements, which prevented supplier investment planning;• insufficient investment, which generated long-term costs and prevented performance incentivisation;• lack of investment in good staff, which caused unnaturally high turnover and prevented personal relationship development and efficient business processes;• adversarial, bureaucratic commercial practices and attitudes, which increased costs, caused delays and reduced trust;• lack of culture-matching results in “us and them” attitudes, which resulted in a downward spiral of poor behaviour, reduced benefits and low performance.The key lessons of collaborationFor collaborative relationships to be successful, the following foundations need to be in place:• Both organisations need a common focus, that is a shared commitment to a basic strategy.• An agreed joint process is required. This is often a problem, because for organisations to can have little understanding of their own internal processes. So, agreeing on a joint one can be difficult.• Integration of internal applications is important to ensure good communication and data flow across the relationship.• Flexibility and responsiveness are critical for both organisations to create agility within the relationship.• Agreed joint performance measures. Both parties should be measuring the success of the relationship in a common way using the same metrics. Hard measures will need to be used but “soft” measures for gauging the success of the relationship in terms of levels of trust and personal relationships also need to be included. This point is important because surprisingly few organisations measure the soft relationship issues and continue to focus on hard performance measures which only reveal the symptoms of failure and not the causes. Instead, companies need to ask questions such as: how many business relationships do we have? Why are they important? Which ones are doing well and why? Which ones are not doing well and why? How do we identify hard targets for continuous relationship improvement?ConclusionWhen striving to create win-win relationships, it could be argued that the first question all organisations need to ask is: how will the company or internal function you want to collaborate with benefit from collaborating with you. Ultimately, if there is nothing in it for the other party there is no motivation for collaboration and, therefore, the “multiplication effect” will not occur.Richard Wilding is chair in supply chain risk management at the Cranfield School of Management and specialises in the creation of collaborative supply chain environments

106;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-10-05T17:35:40Z;Using IPOs to prove value of M&A targets;;Several years ago, eBay was in negotiations to acquire PayPal in order to boost its payments settled online and obtain PayPal’s antifraud capabilities. At the time, PayPal was privately held, and the two parties were unable to come to terms on price. PayPal opted to go public, the equity market certified the value that the company claimed it was worth, and eBay completed the acquisition for $1.5bn a few months later – at a 20 per cent premium.This deal illustrates the widespread phenomenon of “dual tracking”, whereby a company’s initial public offering (IPO) and sell-out occur in sequence over a short period of time. The PayPal example represents public dual tracking, whereby a company carries out the IPO only to be acquired shortly thereafter. Private dual tracking has become increasingly frequent and involves companies filing to go public and selling out before the equity offering takes place. Recent cases of private dual-tracked businesses include Noveon, Advertising.com, Borden Chemical and Brightmail.These examples challenge some of the received wisdom on IPOs and the decision to go public. Traditionally, IPOs have been viewed as pure financing choices that are independent from overall strategy and “real” investment decisions. IPOs are also routinely portrayed as natural end-states for successful entrepreneurial companies. However, these cases reveal that IPOs have implications for M&A markets, the corporate development decisions of other companies and the strategic direction of entrepreneurial companies. Therefore, rather than evaluating the benefits or costs of going public in isolation, companies need to account for a broader set of considerations, such as how the IPO might affect their future growth plans or even their ability to exit through a takeover.At first glance, the dual-tracking phenomenon is puzzling. Why would businesses work to go public, only to be acquired by another company? Why would they bear all of the direct and indirect costs of going public rather than simply selling outright? In fact, using IPOs to “tee up” companies for sale appears to be a costly proposition. Aside from the direct loss of managerial time, registration and underwriting costs alone average 14 per cent of the proceeds raised. Moreover, the practice of discounting the share price on the day of the offering, or “underpricing,” can also represent a substantial indirect cost of going public.The answer to this puzzle can be found in the intrinsic features of some M&A deals, as well as in the ways IPOs work to address fundamental problems in acquisitions. In this article, we will discuss some of the economic rationales for the dual-tracking phenomenon. Subsequently, we will cover some of the evidence that is emerging on dual tracking and the alternatives that buyers and sellers have at their disposal in conducting M&As.How M&A targets can be like used carsIn 2001, George Akerlof, A. Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work on information economics. The classic market for “lemons” example offered by Prof Akerlof describes how the market for used cars can fail because of the information asymmetries between a buyer and seller that arise due to the latter’s experience with the vehicle. In the absence of appropriate remedies, such as warranties, reputation and so on, buyers will discount their offer prices for all used cars and, as a consequence, the sellers of high-quality vehicles will no longer be willing to trade.Indeed, information asymmetries crop up in an array of settings, including M&As. During M&A valuation and negotiation processes, an acquirer needs to be able to discern the value of a target, and the parties need to agree on a price for the transaction. The acquiring company collects information on the target during the due diligence process, yet it often still remains at an information disadvantage in M&A negotiations. Buyers, therefore, face the risk of “adverse selection”, or overpaying and winding up with a “lemon”. Because M&A targets can have attributes that are only understood after purchase, costly surprises emerge during the post-merger integration process.For their part, sellers have an incentive to misrepresent the quality of the company and realise higher gains from the deal. In short, the seller has a credibility problem that is rooted in the one-shot nature of sell-outs, and its claims will be discounted accordingly. As a result, sellers of good companies run the risk of not receiving fair value for their assets. Therefore, it is in each party’s interest to address the problems posed by information asymmetries in M&As.Academics in strategic management and financial economics are now using the insights from information economics to understand when asymmetric information can adversely affect the efficiency of acquisitions, what remedies might be available, and how buyers and sellers can design deals to address these challenges.The value of dual trackingTo understand why the IPO process can facilitate M&A transactions, it is important to recognise that the problems noted above are especially likely to be present for entrepreneurial targets. Little historical or codified information tends to be available on privately held targets, particularly younger ones. Moreover, many entrepreneurial companies suffer from the lack of legitimacy that comes with time and the accumulation of business relationships. It is also the case that the bulk of the value of entrepreneurial companies comes from future growth opportunities and intangible assets, which are notoriously difficult to value.Going public can reduce the problem of adverse selection in two ways. First, an IPO can directly reduce the information asymmetries between the company and prospective bidders. This is due to the credible information that becomes available through disclosures made in response to regulations for registration and subsequent listing. Moreover, in valuing companies, the equity market works to aggregate heterogeneous information on the issuer.Second, by going public, a company sends signals to potential acquirers, and these signals reduce the effects of information asymmetries that are bound to remain. For instance, the mere fact that the company is able to bear the costs of going public can suggest to bidders that there is a higher probability that it is of higher quality, compared with companies that remain private. In effect, the new issue market works as a screening device, and it will be tougher for companies to pass through this screen in cold, rather than hot, IPO markets. Targets can also signal value through the underwriter that assists in taking the company public. The market for underwriters’ services is segmented in such a way that the best companies tend to be taken public by the most prominent underwriters, so potential bidders can use these associations to help screen targets.Going public offers many possible opportunities for companies to send signals about their quality. These include choices such as how much ownership to dispose of rather than retain, how to price the offering, and so on. David Langstaff, CEO of Veridian, an IT security company acquired by General Dynamics in 2003, has emphasised the need to make the right “first impression” when going public. He maintains that this is achieved by thinking through which exchange to list on, which investment banker to use for the IPO, and which analysts will cover the company once the offering has taken place.Recent research is offering evidence that IPOs can have important implications for M&A deal-making. This research concerns overall M&A patterns as well as performance outcomes, so it can inform a business’s acquisition policies and tactics on both the buy and sell sides of deals. Below are a few of the conclusions coming out of this emerging work by us and others.■ Dual tracking can offer higher premiums to targets than outright sales A recent study by James Brau of Brigham Young University and Ninon Kohers of the University of South Florida found that public dual-track targets generally earned a 24 per cent higher premium than private companies that sold outright. Private dual-track targets enjoyed a 26 per cent higher premium compared with private targets selling outright.■ Buyers can also benefit from targeting IPO companies Despite paying higher premiums for private companies pursuing IPOs, buyers do not earn lower abnormal returns. A recent study by Qin Lian at the University of Kansas attributes this to the IPO registration process improving the matching of companies in the M&A market.■ Certain companies are better candidates for dual tracking than others Our analyses have shown that companies with substantial intangibles are more likely to go public and then sell out, rather than divest outright. By contrast, companies with modest intangibles are relatively easy to assess and can be sold efficiently while still being closely held.■ Some IPO companies are particularly likely to be acquired Going public can offer signals on company value, but the strength of these signals will vary significantly from issuer to issuer. For instance, companies that are taken public by venture capitalists are more likely to be acquired after they go public than companies that did not have such backing. Also, companies that are associated with prominent underwriters are more likely to be acquired after their IPOs than companies taken public by less reputable investment banks.■ Dual tracking affects M&A deal structures The risk for acquirers of adverse selection will be greatest when they pay for the target using a lump sum cash payment. In contrast, by using stock to finance the transaction, buyers can transfer part of the overpayment risk to the target, since the value of stock received by the target will reflect the performance of the combined entity.Targets can be reluctant to accept the bidder’s stock, since buyers are more likely to pay with overvalued shares, but high-quality targets are able to enjoy higher stock prices, instead of receiving a lump sum in cash. Our research found that the odds of using stock rather than cash to finance M&As are one-and-a-half times greater for outright acquisitions of private targets compared with newly public targets.■ Dual-tracked companies can attract a broader set of acquirers IPO companies that become acquisition targets are more likely to be bought out by geographically distant acquirers when their IPOs are backed by venture capitalists or prestigious underwriters. The likelihood of a newly public company being acquired by a remote, rather than a geographically close, bidder also increases with the offering’s underpricing.Managing adverse selection in M&AsIt is important to emphasise that acquirers will need to find other means of dealing with adverse selection when choosing to acquire privately held targets. Moreover, dual tracking is only one way for sellers and bidders to address the risk of adverse selection in M&As.Our discussion has specifically focused on how IPOs can reveal information on target companies and send signals on their quality, but there are alternative ways to tackle the problem of adverse selection, particularly when conducting deals with privately held targets. One way around the problem is to form a limited alliance before proceeding with the acquisition.A joint venture allows companies to combine assets in a distinct, jointly controlled business which can help the acquiring business understand the target’s resources better. Philips, for example, sold a 53 per cent stake in its domestic appliances unit to Whirlpool, so that the latter could understand the strength of the dealer network before completing the acquisition.If a company decides to proceed with an acquisition of a private company, what might it do to manage the risk of an adverse selection? There are two additional tactics. First, target selection needs to be considered carefully because the risk of adverse selection will be higher for certain closely held targets than others.Companies are less likely to be at an information disadvantage when acquiring companies in their sector or that are geographically close. In particular, acquirers are better positioned to understand and evaluate the resources, products, relationships and claims of a nearby target or direct rival than other sellers. It follows that bidders that are geographically distant or that hail from other industries have the most to gain from the signals a target company sends when undertaking an IPO.Second, deal structuring needs to be given careful consideration. Companies can address the risk of adverse selection by the way they put together M&A transactions. The acquisition of Skype is a case in point. In the summer of 2005, the internet telephony operator contemplated a partial acquisition by News Corp, but the companies could not agree on price. Several months later, eBay acquired Skype for $2.6bn in cash, and Skype would receive an additional $1.5bn by 2009, provided it met performance targets.This deal structure, which is known as a contingent earnout, reallocates overpayment risk from the bidder to the target, and is most often used in acquisitions of private companies. High-quality sellers benefit by being able to obtain a greater total payment and are able to provide a credible signal of their worth. However, earnouts present several important drawbacks, one of which is the need to measure the target’s independent performance after the deal has been completed. This consideration implies that earnouts are not suitable for deals with high integration requirements.The phenomenon of dual tracking and these alternative ways of addressing adverse selection in M&As have important implications for acquisition deal-making. On the sell side, companies need to consider IPOs not as pure financing choices or as natural end-states. Rather, IPOs need to be considered as strategic choices that have consequences for future transactions.On the buy side, corporate development staff and advisers need to add IPOs to their M&A toolkits. IPOs can play important roles in facilitating M&A transactions and reducing costly surprises that crop up during post-merger integration. They are particularly relevant for certain types of transactions (diversifying acquisitions) and they influence the design of M&A deals (cash versus stock versus earnout). By paying attention to the risk of adverse selection in M&As, sellers and buyers alike can improve their odds of capturing value from such transactions.Jeffrey J.

107;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-10-05T17:35:40Z;The China question;;"Talking about turnaround in a market that has been growing by double digits for most of the past three decades may seem like an unnecessary exercise. Yet China, one of the most intriguing but complex markets in the world, is an ideal exception to the old adage that a rising tide raises all boats.While there are many illustrations of commercial success in China – 44 per cent of the US-China Business Council’s members surveyed in the past year said their profitability in China was higher than their worldwide profitability – there are still many cases that have not met expectations. In 2005, for example, US and European businesses were leaving the China power generating market, and companies as diverse as Whirlpool, Yahoo and eBay have been disappointed with their results.China remains a difficult place to do business, whether it is an M&A, joint venture or greenfield investment. Thus, as the number and value of cross-border transactions in China continue to surge, we believe that many will require a vigorous turnaround of the businesses concerned.Recently, we studied three expatriate executives in different turnaround efforts in China. This article examines their situations and thoughts about what leadership traits are needed to achieve success in such transactions.The expatriate executivesSindy Watson is an executive in the Asia-Pacific region of a European technology company. Since the early 1980s, the corporation had been involved in a joint venture with a state-owned enterprise in China, but problems emerged over issues of technology and control. Her company had three choices: exit the market; go it alone; or try to rekindle the joint venture (the least popular option within the company).Ms Watson and her Asia-based colleagues believed that China might be the best future the company had, so they hijacked the annual budget planning meeting. Instead of feeding the CEO with “accounting history”, they successfully won him over with the “future promise” of China.Ms Watson then became part of a team that moved the company’s regional headquarters to Shanghai and restructured the relationship with the Chinese partner. Today, China is one of the most profitable divisions and a powerhouse of intellectual capital for the entire corporation.Richard Pitt ran the international operations of medical solutions business Santésol until he took charge of operations in China. The company had been there for 12 years, but he believed that it should be more important in China, and China should be more important within Santésol. He became an avid student of the market, pursuing every source of information he could and passing on Chinese contacts to his overseas colleagues, knowing that he was building a network of allies at home. By proposing the transfer of some outsourcing and R&D activities to China, Mr Pitt also made headquarters open to the prospects of transforming China into a partner, rather than merely a market or a competitor.Arnaud Jaccard established and ran a successful joint venture between a European multinational corporation and a state-owned enterprise in China. Three years after retiring, he returned to Shanghai as CEO of a demoralised Chinese machinery manufacturer.Mr Jaccard wanted to turn around the company within six months and then build it into an international exporter. The challenges were formidable: a factory without foreign experience; an organisation where personal relationships mattered more than performance and seniority outweighed competence. In his first week, Mr Jaccard focused on showing the workforce that he saw them as the primary asset and valued their contribution.Lessons from turnaroundsDespite the differences between these situations, there are enough similarities to draw some useful conclusions when thinking about turnaround in China.■ Strong belief Each case was powered by a belief in China as an opportunity. Ms Watson had lived in the region long enough to appreciate what was happening. Mr Pitt was mentored by old China hands who believed in the market’s future. And Mr Jaccard had worked in China for nine years and was devoted to its potential. Belief enabled them to engage in an energetic but demanding effort to turn belief into reality.■ Determination to understand China Each individual made a determined effort to learn all they could about China. Although they used different means, including networking, observing, listening and analysing market data, they all became students of China as well as effective business leaders.■ Fast pace Each person acted quickly. This speed allowed them to always be ahead in shaping key conversations about the future of their companies. In other words, they seized politically opportune moments within the company to influence China-related choices.■ The capacity to change In a rapidly changing market like China, being unencumbered is a major advantage. Each of the three insisted on sufficient independence to allow them to act fast, do things differently and not look back. Nevertheless, none of them ever neglected the need to communicate back to and obtain support from corporate headquarters.■ Enduring vision Each individual knew exactly what they wanted to get out of China in measurable terms. They understood that they needed to strike a balance between short/medium-term goals and long-term vision, and, hence, they never lost sight of the necessity to deliver business results today before realising dreams tomorrow.For example, while Mr Pitt had to travel widely and engage in numerous meetings to identify opportunities, he also used the latest technologies to ensure he was always accessible to make key decisions on day-to-day operations.■ Proactiveness to expand their role All were flexible enough to take on additional responsibilities if required. For example, when Ms Watson migrated from a marketing position to a coaching and bridging role, she transferred her organisational knowledge and international management expertise to the local team, and also represented the region in dealing with headquarters.■ Involvement of other colleagues Each of these individuals built allies by involving more, rather than fewer, people. As soon as they recognised an opportunity, they shared it across the organisation. For example, Ms Watson shared the sales forecasting technique, a best practice developed in China, with the rest of the Asia-Pacific region. They also invited, and paid for, their overseas colleagues to visit China in order to change their mindsets. The more colleagues buy in, the more allies there are to pursue a collective action, rather than having only one person influencing headquarters.■ Comprehensive follow through Beyond good ideas, it is the follow through which makes the difference. Each individual followed up continually. It may not be glamorous, but it does turn dreams into reality.■ Focus on details Each leader is a case study in incessant action: extensive travel, endless meetings and lots of promises. More important, however, is how they embrace the details. For example, within the first week of his new assignment, Mr Jaccard had modified the lunch schedules of factory workers, fixed broken windows and cleaned factory floors. Success was built on the details that others had overlooked in pursuit of grand strategy.■ A preference for face-to-face This is not leadership through e-mail. Each of these individuals wanted to fully assess their counterparts – employees, customers or suppliers – and strengthen the relationship as quickly as possible. Face-to-face contact was the only way to achieve this.■ Trust in local employees Each leader respected local talent as real assets and relied on them for ideas, insights and imagination. This led to powerful working relationships that allowed the organisation to move quickly in a completely new direction. For example, Mr Jaccard’s actions to improve working conditions were done in a manner that clearly conveyed his devotion to the workforce.Emerging markets are different in many ways. What is reassuring from looking at these three examples, is that the means to success is not all that different from what is regarded as good practice anywhere.William A.

108;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-07-27T17:12:26Z;Mandelson embroiled in ‘fridge war’;;Peter Mandelson, EU trade commissioner, has become embroiled in a “fridge war” with electrical goods makers in Europe after he took an eleventh-hour decision not to levy anti-dumping duties on certain Korean imports.Mr Mandelson is accused by Whirlpool, the US home appliance maker with operations in Europe, of succumbing to “devious lobbying activity” and of “a serious breach in procedures”.It claims that his decision not to impose punitive tariffs on Korean “three-door side-by-side” fridges would have “direct and very significant consequences for the European industry”.The large fridges, which have a freezer underneath, are popular in the US and are a growth sector in the domestic appliance market. European manufacturers claim Korean companies, particularly LG and Daewoo, are dumping them at below-cost price.A lengthy inquiry by Mr Mandelson’s officials initially suggested levying anti-dumping duties of up to 12.2 per cent on Korean side-by-side fridges, but the commissioner intervened to limit the scope to cover only two-door appliances.His decision was taken just a week before trade officials from EU member states considered the issue on July 20 and was not relayed to companies involved in the case until several days later.The British commissioner’s aides say the decision to exclude three-door fridges was taken after “confidential consultations”.“There is no European production of these three-door fridges, so the idea that European industry is damaged by cheap Korean fridges coming into the EU is a bit hard to argue,” said one EU official.“Whirlpool exports these fridges to Europe from the US and are effectively asking a commercial favour to help them compete against Korean rivals. That is not what our anti-dumping measures are about.”But Whirlpool says it wants to start making three-door fridges in Europe, as do Electrolux and Bosch-Siemens. The companies argue that Korean dumping – the result of fierce price competition among Korean chaebols – would make that unviable.Whirlpool, which has operations in Italy, reacted angrily to Mr Mandelson’s decision.“The inexplicable U-turn seems to have been caused by Korean lobbying at the highest level,” said Marc Bitzer, president of Whirlpool Europe, in a letter to the EU’s Finnish presidency.“No commissioner can be allowed to disregard procedures under the influence of devious lobbying activity, ignoring 13 months of thorough investigation.”Mr Mandelson’s aides say only four member states opposed his anti-dumping proposals, eight abstained and 12 supported his limited measures, giving him a “comfortable” majority.The decision is expected to be rubber-stamped by the 25-member European Commission on Friday, in spite of fierce lobbying over the past few days.
109;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-05-10T18:02:55Z;Whirlpool to cut 4,500 jobs in plant closures;;Whirlpool announced plans on Wednesday to close three laundry-making plants as part of its integration of Maytag, though pledged to maintain washer and dryer production in the US.The US group created the world’s largest maker of household appliances with the $1.7bn takeover of its smaller rival, which had struggled with higher-cost plants as competitors switched production to Asia and Latin America.Whirlpool launched its bid for Maytag in July 2005 and finally closed the deal on March 31 after regulators waved it through despite concerns that its near-70 per cent share of the domestic market could dent competition.The planned closure of three US plants is the first step in the integration and will lead to the loss of 4,500 jobs from a global workforce of more than 80,000. However, it plans to create 1,500 new positions at existing Whirlpool factories. The cuts include 1,800 salaried positions from the consolidation of research and development centres and of corporate functions at Whirlpool’s headquarters in Michigan.Washers and dryers were the largest segment for both companies, and Maytag’s laundry business – which focused on mid-market brands – was regarded as the strongest part of an operation which had suffered from under-investment.But David Swift, president of Whirlpool North America, said in a statement that its existing laundry operations were among the most efficient in the world. “This was a difficult, but necessary decision that will further improve the cost efficiency of our laundry operations, providing consumers with industry-leading innovation and competitively produced washers and dryers from US-based manufacturing locations.”Whirlpool said the cuts would cost $135m-$145m, and will give further details of the integration plan on May 23.Analysts believe Maytag’s core white-goods business is profitable, but loss-making units such as the Hoover floor-care and Dixie-Marco vending machine business have been earmarked for sale, with Black and Decker cited by analysts as one potential buyer for Hoover, which is valued at about $250m.Whirlpool has enjoyed buoyant sales in the US, which accounts for almost two-thirds of revenues, and is introducing new ranges of premium-priced models having successfully pushed through a series of price rises last year to counter rising raw-material costs.The May 23 briefing will be closely watched for details on how Whirlpool plans to position the laundry brands to avoid cannibalisation of sales, and generate savings from integrating the cooking, refrigerator and dishwasher businesses. It has also earmarked its Amana and Jade commercial-appliance businesses for sale.
110;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-05-09T15:05:30Z;Hot M&A market helps Lazard soar;;Lazard, the US boutique investment bank, on Tuesday reported a 68 per cent rise in first-quarter net income, capitalising on a scorching mergers and acquisitions market.Steven Golub, Lazard vice-chairman, said that the bank’s deal pipeline remained strong in the US and Europe and that he expected the hot merger market to continue for some time.“We continue to see very strong and growing chief executive confidence and probably the most liquidity we’ve seen in the marketplace, maybe ever,” Mr Golub said.Led by veteran Wall Street banker Bruce Wasserstein, Lazard went public last May after 157 years as a private partnership. Lazard, along with other Wall Street banks, has seen its share price surge in recent months on the robust deal environment.Mr Golub said Lazard’s role as an adviser to activist investor Carl Icahn had not hurt the bank’s ability to sign on new corporate clients.Some questioned whether executives would move away from Lazard, based on the firm’s work for Mr Icahn in his campaign for changes at Time Warner, the media group. “I’ll let the results speak for themselves,” Mr Golub said of any lingering impact.Lazard said mergers and acquisition revenue surged 59 per cent to a record $194m. Asset management revenue jumped 16 per cent to $124.4m. Net income rose 68 per cent to $52.5m, or 51 cents per share, beating analyst expectations of 47 cents per share.The only weak spot came in restructuring where revenue was $13.6m compared with $24.1m a year earlier. Mr Golub said the drop reflected the ability of companies to avoid default.He said Lazard had signed on as an adviser to many of the automotive parts companies currently undergoing restructuring and added that the restructuring business would not grow until the economic cycle shifted.Mr Golub said the results reflected market conditions and the bank’s focus on holding down costs. Compensation was 57 per cent of revenues compared with 57.5 per cent for the first quarter of 2005.Among transactions completed in the first quarter, Lazard served as adviser to MCI in its merger with Verizon and Maytag on its sale to Whirlpool.Among deals announced this year, Lazard is working for Gaz de France on its merger with Suez and Fisher Scientific on its merger with Thermo Electron.
111;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-04-25T20:47:20Z;Robust earnings have little impact on Wall Street;;Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday as rising consumer confidence and housing data dragged down leading indices in spite of robust earnings from companies such as Yum! Brands, Weatherford and Whirlpool.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 6.37 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 1,301.74, while the Nasdaq dipped 3.08 points, or 0.1 per cent to 2,330.30. The Dow Jones also finished the day 0.5 per cent, or 53.07 points, lower at 11,283.25.Data showing an increase in existing home sales in March and a rise in consumer confidence to a four-year peak stoked fears of higher interest rates and depressed the market.Sun Microsystems, the maker of computer servers, closed slightly higher after it announced a change in management after the close on Monday.Scott McNealy, chief executive, said that he would step down in favour of Jonathan Schwartz, company president.

113;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-03-29T21:06:09Z;Whirlpool-Maytag deal wins antitrust approval;;Whirlpool’s $1.7bn takeover of Maytag was approved by antitrust authorities at the Justice Deparment on Wednesday without any conditions, clearing the way for the creation of the world’s largest appliance maker.The DoJ’s decision, in the face of claims that the combined company could control up to 70 per cent of the market for washers and dryers in the US, followed an eight-month-long investigation that was seen as a major test of the limits of the Bush administration’s stance on antitrust issues.It also put a spotlight on Thomas Barnett, the freshly confirmed head of the antitrust division who has gained a reputation among antitrust attorneys for having approved deals during his short tenure against the recommendation of his staff.Mr Barnett said the deal would not “substantially” reduce competition, was “not likely” to harm consumer welfare, and was “not likely” to give the merged entity market power in the sale of any of its products.His defence of the deal hinted at a new, emerging standard of antitrust review. This would still consider a company’s current market share, but would give more weight to an industry’s future competitive landscape. In this case, Mr Barnett said foreign companies such as LG and Samsung could increase their imports into the US in the next few years, adding to competition in the market.Although he denied that the DoJ was taking a new approach, Mr Barnett emphasised the attention he paid to the potential for new entrants, the excess capacity of other US manufacturers, and the cost savings that would be generated by the combined companies.“The division found that, despite the two companies’ relatively high share of laundry product sales in the US, any attempt to raise prices likely would be unsuccessful,” he said.Approval of the deal also reflects that the DoJ viewed the Kenmore brand of appliances, which is owned by Sears but is largely manufactured by Whirlpool, as a potential rival to the combined company.The decision vindicates Maytag’s directors and advisers, who spent week last year wrestling with the likelihood that a combination with Whirlpool would be cleared by antitrust regulators.Between July and August, Maytag pushed Whirlpool to raise its offer three times in order to make up for the risk that regulators might block the deal. Maytag’s board had previously signed off on a takeover bid which carried no antitrust risk from Ripplewood Holdings, a buy-out group, for the much lower price of $1.1bn.If the takeover by Whirlpool had not been approved, many observers believe it would have provided a second opportunity for Haier, the Chinese appliance maker, to attempt a bid for Maytag. In June, Haier teamed up with Blackstone and Bain Capital, the private equity groups, to study Maytag’s books but decided not to pursue an offer.The prospect of an iconic US brand and manufacturer being taken over by a Chinese group generated political opposition at the time, coming as CNOOC, the Chinese energy group, was attempting to gain control of California-based Unocal
114;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-02-26T18:29:12Z;Manufacturers must make use of design counsel;;"The growth of interest in iconic design products such as the Apple iPod or Toyota Prius has turned everyone into a designer, writes Tom Lester. Consumers’ expectations of technology have been sharpened and, as competition and the rate of product development in­creases, manufacturers are obliged to spend more to differentiate their models.Those that fail to get the message risk following General Motors’ downward path: vice-chairman Bob Lutz admits “having built products 20-odd years ago which in many cases were well below best international standards in design, dynamics, craftsmanship and reliability”. The fact that GM is still suffering from those mistakes shows how critical good design management is and how long customers’ memories are.At the heart of the matter is the customer: design that doesn’t appeal to buyers is more of a liability than an asset, however pleasing it may be to the designers and their gurus.The UK’s Design Council has aimed to improve UK design standards for more than 60 years but, according to its research, fewer than half of British companies understand the real contribution that design can make.Internationally, though, British designers have built a strong reputation among manufacturers. Samsung, for example, sought the services of the British firm Seymour Powell as design consultancy.Dick Powell, director of Seymour Powell and design adviser to Samsung, identifies a problem in the ­relationship between designer and management. Marketers can use their sales data, market research and focus groups as the basis of a design brief for a new product. But without imagination, the brief is likely to be retrospective and incapable of carrying the business forward. And if the design cycle takes two or three years from concept to shipment – as it typically does – the result can be ­market stagnation.Some 45 per cent of Seymour Powell’s work is therefore devoted to researching the market context, customer usage, ethnographic studies and other relevant issues. Results are fed into the “crucible process”, in which marketing, research and development, engineering and other departments are brought together to create a picture of the development of the line or brand. Then a brief is produced.An example of this process in action is provided by Richard Eisermann, until recently the director of design and innovation at the Design Council and former design director of Whirlpool Europe. When he was at Whirlpool, the household appliance maker, he ex-plains, a big study was undertaken of customers’ laundry practices to find new clues for product development. “We found there was a lot of stooping and bending and they overstuffed their machines.”The engineers produced a design where the machine was raised off the floor and the drum was enlarged. “The marketing data said it wouldn’t sell. But it has been a huge seller, and we used features in the existing range and in the US.”So what does design bring to the party that the existing marketing and engineering functions cannot provide?Mr Powell says that most of his clients “come to us because they don’t know what to do”. He says there is no agreed strategy, only a reaction to events. “They need to find a mechanism for new developments.”A strong design team functions in three ways: as a catalyst or go-between to link the company’s functional silos round the development of new products; as visualisers of possible new developments that may be outside current thinking and experience; and as interdisciplinary designers of the chosen product.In a downturn, adds Mr Eisermann, “the CEO’s eye will be on next quarter’s profits and the first thing that gets cut is the design budget. But that is exactly when you need to be planning new developments. If you haven’t figured out what is next when the upturn comes you are in trouble.”Often it is the culture of the company that stifles innovation. As well as putting pressure on costs and creating an aversion to risk, departmental silos can destroy innovation.Mr Eisermann cites the example of a design project at Amtrak, the US passenger rail operator, when he worked for the Boston-based consultancy, Ideo, which was hired to design the new rolling stock for the high-speed Washington-Boston service.The success of the investment depended on giving passengers “a seamless journey”, he explains. But this was hampered by divisions in the organisation, with ticket sales, baggage handling and operations all working in isolation.“We told them: ‘What you need to look at first is the service you provide. If you don’t have the right service, the shiny new equipment will soon be faded.’ And they absolutely took it on board. It affected their whole approach.”Designers don’t al­ways get it right, though, however well they do their research. Alastair Fisher, managing director of a cutlery business based in Sheffield in the north of England, thanks the product redesign of his range of kitchen knives for resisting imports from south-east Asia. “I have been inundated by Japanese companies interested in the new range – but we have had to tweak it a bit.”The redesign, he says, called for white handles, which look good. “But when we offered the new range to some big UK retailers, sales were disappointing. So for them, we have relaunched with black handles.”WAYS TO MAKE PRODUCT DESIGN WORK■Ensure the corporate culture does not stifle innovation.■Make product development a continuous process.■Improve communications between functions and select a multidisciplinary team.■Use outside help in assessing products and services for competitiveness, ease of use and visual impact.■Research customer attitudes, usage, needs and gaps.■Decide on priorities: replacing unsatisfactory products, improving existing ones or defining new products.■Appoint external designers to examine and criticise.■Revise priorities, appoint a champion and budget for chosen new products."
115;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-02-14T00:09:26Z;Whirlpool delays Maytag deal;;"The Department of Justice has reached an agreement with Whirlpool to extend an antitrust review of the US appliance maker’s proposed merger with Maytag for an additional 30 days.The extension marks the second time Whirlpool has agreed to put off the closing of its $1.7bn bid for Maytag in order for the DoJ to complete its investigation of
the deal.Whirlpool’s lead attorney on the transaction yesterday said the extension was “not an unusual event” and that he remained “confident” the deal would close “rapidly” once the probe was completed.James Rill, a former senior antitrust official at the Department of Justice who represents Whirlpool, said the company was discussing the deal with staff-level officials at the DoJ, indicating that talks did not yet involve Thomas Barnett, the head of the department’s antitrust division.Mr Rill acknowledged that the DoJ was preparing a potential lawsuit against the deal, but emphasised that such actions were not unusual while staff were considering a merger. He also declined to comment on whether or not the parties were discussing potential divestitures to satisfy antitrust concerns.Whirlpool’s proposed acquisition of Maytag would create a behemoth in the global appliance market. Critics of the deal, including the American Antitrust Institute, have said a combination of the two laundry giants would damage the market for top-loading dryers and other appliances and that the combined company would control up to 70 per cent of the market for washers and dryers.“Quite frankly, we remain convinced that this is a highly competitive industry, that there are significant cost savings, and quality products as a result of the transaction that would otherwise not be available,” Mr Rill said.A successful outcome for Whirlpool will largely depend on whether the company can convince antitrust officials that foreign entrants, particularly from China, are developing a strong enough presence in the US to keep the appliance market competitive."
116;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-02-03T13:55:35Z;Maytag reports wider loss than expected;;Maytag, the home appliance maker, on Friday reported a fourth-quarter loss that widened fivefold compared to a year ago due to restructuring and merger charges related to its pending takeover by larger rival Whirlpool.Maytag said it would consider options including the possible sale of its Hoover vacuum-cleaner business. Weaker vacuum cleaner sales offset higher turnover in products including washing machines and refrigerators.The company, which is waiting for anti-trust approval of the $1.7bn deal with Whirlpool, said it lost $75m, or 93 cents per share, compared with a loss of $14.1m, or 18 cents per share in the previous year. Excluding charges in both periods, the company’s loss widened by just over 260 per cent, from $15.7m in the previous year to $56.7m.The loss exceeded analyst forecasts of 13 cents a share.Maytag shares fell 3.27 per cent in early trading in New York to $17.43. Whirpool shares were also lower, falling more than 1 per cent to $85.08.A revenue increase of 6.6 per cent was dented by the poor performance of Maytag’s vacuum cleaner and commercial business, which suffered a 1.1 per cent fall in sales. The results prompted Ralph Hake, chief executive, to say that “expect to evaluate alternative strategies for our floor care product line and commercial businesses, including their possible sale”.The fourth-quarter operating loss of the home appliances business was seven times the size of that in commercial products and rose almost sixfold compared with the previous year. Meanwhile, the loss in home appliances widened by almost 1,400 per cent compared to the year-ago quarter.Mr Hake said Maytag’s “overall high cost structure” also weighed on the company’s performance. Maytag and Whirlpool have lobbied in Washington for approval of their merger, arguing that heightened competition from Chinese-manufactured appliances warranted the combination of two companies that would have a combined market share of 70 per cent in washers and dryers.For the full year, Maytag reported a 3.8 per cent increase in revenues to $4.9bn, from $4.7bn in the previous year. The company lost nine times as much as in the previous year, or $81.9m, compared with $9m.
117;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-02-02T21:59:49Z;US stocks end down in spite of resilient retailers;;Strong January retail sales failed to prevent a sharp fall in US stocks on Thursday.Federal Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, Gap and Wal-Mart all reported higher monthly sales as shoppers were tempted out by warmer weather.Federated Department Stores gained 4 per cent to $69.73 after it lifted earnings guidance, Gap rose 3.2 per cent to $18.55 as it delivered higher sales when the market expected a fall, while the popularity of youth clothing label Abercrombie & Fitch sent its shares 4.1 per cent higher to $69.27. Wal-Mart rose 0.3 per cent to $46.28 after its figures came in ahead of expectations.While the wider market ended sharply lower, the S&P 500 retail index managed a gain of 0.2 per cent.“The warm weather helped to bring people out and the use of gift cards” also boosted sales, said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The retailers posted good numbers, their guidance was good, and that’s why they are bucking the market.”However, he said that concern remained about a consumer spending slowdown should the wealth effect from the strong housing market end.In the wider market, stocks fell sharply as investors worried about an unexpected drop in productivity in the fourth-quarter and the effect on interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.9 per cent at 10,851.98, the broader S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,270.84 and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.2 per cent at 2,281.57.Disappointing earnings from Tyco International, the troubled conglomerate, and cable group Comcast also weighed on sentiment. Those stocks fell 5 per cent to $24.80 and 3.5 per cent to $27.02 respectively.General Motors, off 3.7 per cent to $23.60, was the worst performer on the Dow after a downgrade from UBS, while carparts group Dana lost 8.4 per cent to $4.68 as the Securities and Exchange Commission began a formal inquiry into company’s accounting practices.Dana is the worst performing S&P 500 stock this year, off 35 per cent.United Airlines slumped 10.3 per cent to $35.89 on its first day of trading following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.There were some gainers. Starbucks, the coffee chain, jumped 9.7 per cent to $34.40 after it raised guidance on earnings following a record quarter and confirmed plans to open 1,800 new outlets this year.Ashley Reed Woodruff, at Bear Stearns, raised her price target on the stock by $2 to $39-$40. “Starbucks is off to a strong start in 2006. We expect strong US sales growth and profit improvement internationally to continue to drive the shares going forward,” she said.A sharp jump in quarterly profit boosted washing machine maker Whirlpool. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $86.37.
118;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2006-01-26T18:57:43Z;Whirlpool and Maytag step up merger lobby;;Whirlpool and Maytag have in recent weeks stepped up efforts to rally support on Capitol Hill for their $1.7bn merger in the face of criticism from some opponents in Washington who say the deal, which would combine two of the largest appliance makers in the world, is anti-competitive.The companies have been meeting staff on the Senate antitrust committee and other lawmakers ahead of a February 27 deadline that marks the end of the Department of Justice’s ongoing review of the deal, according to two congressional staffers.At the centre of the antitrust debate lie questions about whether foreign – especially Chinese – rivals have garnered a significant enough presence in the US market to merit a combination of two manufacturers that critics say would control up to 70 per cent of the market for washers and dryers.The outcome of the review process is also likely to hinge on whether the DoJ includes appliances that Whirlpool manufactures for the Kenmore brand, which is owned by Sears, in its analysis of Whirlpool’s market share.James Rill, a former antitrust official who represents Whirlpool, said the companies were holding staff-level discussions with the Justice Department on the deal. He said talks were centred on the expanding influence of foreign companies in the US appliance market, and future benefits from the “huge efficiencies” the merger would deliver. Whirlpool and Maytag are trying to shore up congressional support following a damaging assessment of the effect a merger would have on the appliance market by the American Antitrust Institute, a research organisation that says its mission is to “increase the role of competition” in the marketplace.The AAI said the combination of “two laundry giants” would damage the market for top-loading washers – a “product for which there is no foreign competition” – and would allow the group to use its enhanced market power to pressure even powerful retailers like Lowes, Sears and Best Buy.Although AAI considers itself an independent advocacy group, a footnote in the group’s report says that among its more than 100 contributors is “at least one organisation” whose client is an opponent of the Whirlpool-Maytag merger.The companies are also fighting resistance to the deal by Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, and Congressman Leonard Boswell, who say the DoJ should force Whirlpool to divest Maytag’s washer and dryer businesses if it approves the deal.It is far from clear, however, whether Whirlpool would agree to such a divestment even if its acquisition of Maytag hung in the balance. The company has retained the right in regulatory filings to walk away from the deal if it is required to make any divestiture.
119;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-29T09:46:06Z;Haier leads FT ranking of Chinese brands;;Haier, the maker of refrigerators, washing machines and other home appliances, has the strongest corporate brand among Chinese companies, according to a survey of Financial Times readers.The Qingdao-based company was voted top in all the categories in the survey , which included quality, trustworthiness, innovation and management, as well as branding. Lenovo, the company which this year acquired the personal computer business of IBM, came in second place.The purpose of the survey, which was conducted together with McKinsey, the management consultancy, was to find out what businesspeople around the world thought about Chinese companies and their products and services. The 30 companies in the survey were selected by the FT and McKinsey, with write-ins allowed.More than 3,500 FT readers from over 70 countries took the survey, which was held this month.Branding has emerged over the last year as one of the key challenges facing China’s leading corporates. While Chinese companies have won plaudits over the last decade for their ability to manufacture goods reliably and at low cost, few of those companies have been able to make an impact on global markets with their own brand.Founded in 1984, Haier was one of the first Chinese companies to try and establish a global presence, which led it to open a plant in South Carolina in the US in 2001. In 2004, its global revenues were Rmb101.6bn, according to the company’s website.Last month, it came close to making a bid for Maytag, the US appliances group that makes Hoover vacuum cleaners – an acquisition that would have moved the Chinese company out of the low-priced end of the US market. Last week, Whirlpool agreed to acquire Maytag for $2.7bn.Tsingtao Brewery, another consumer brand with an international presence, was in 4th place. However Huawei, the telecoms equipment manufacturer which has made a big push into overseas markets over the last two years, came in only ninth. China’s biggest two internet portals, Sohu.com and Sina.com, were ranked equally at 10th place.When readers were asked which brands they most recognised, Bank of China came top, but only sixth in the overall ranking, the only Chinese bank to make the top 10.Readers were also asked to rate the companies based on whether they thought they could become leading global brands in 10 years. In this ranking of future potential, Haier dropped to number two behind Lenovo, as part of its acquisition of IBM’s PC unit also gained the rights to the well-known Think trademark.If acquisitions are one route to stronger brands, the poll showed that a failed takeover attempt can have beneficial effects on brand awareness.Shanghai Auto tried unsuccessfully to buy MG Rover after the UK company went into administration, yet when readers in the UK were asked to say which Chinese brands they were most familiar with, Shanghai Auto came third, compared with seventh worldwide and only 20th in China.CNOOC, which recently abandoned a bid for Unocal, the US energy group, was the fifth most recognised Chinese brand, although it failed to make the top 10 in the overall ranking.

The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,221.79, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,141.44.Mergers and acquisitions announcements served to give the market an early stimulus.OSI Pharmaceuticals agreed to buy Eyetech Pharmaceuticals for about $935m, helping Eyetech shares surge 29.6 per cent to $18.13. OSI fell 21.7 per cent to $31.92.Canadian oil producer PetroKazakhstan surged 18.4 per cent to $53.75 after the company agreed to be bought by China National Petroleum Corporation for $55 per share.Meanwhile, television and radio broadcaster Emmis Communications said the company would sell nine of its 16 television stations for $681m to various television broadcasters. Shares in Emmis were up 9.2 per cent to $23.58, and they have gained more than 50 per cent since May.Department store Nordstrom said the company would buy a stake in Jeffrey, a company that owns high-end boutiques in New York and Atlanta. Shares were down 1.1 per cent to $33.18Later in the session the Maytag acquisition saga ended when the company signed a formal agreement to be acquired by Whirlpool. Maytag was down 0.1 per cent to $18.69 while Whirlpool shares were down 0.4 per cent to $81.48Merck shares continued falling after a ruling in Texas late on Friday required Merck to pay more than $250m to the family of a person who died after using its painkiller, Vioxx.Investors fear that the company might face thousands of lawsuits in regard to the drug. Merck said it would appeal against the decision. Shares were down 0.6 per cent to $27.89. The two-day loss for the company is almost 8.3 per cent.Technology issues also gained, defying some analysts’ forecasts that growth stocks would take a fall in the coming months.Motorola gained 2.3 per cent to $20.91 after the company said that it would book a $780m gain regarding completion of Sprint’s acquisition of Nextel. Microsoft shares also increased 0.7 per cent to $26.91.Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments rose 2.5 per cent to $31.95, while Intel shares lifted 1.6 per cent to $26.06. The semiconductor and semi-equipment sector enjoyed the biggest advance for the day on all S&P indices, up 1.5 per cent.Northwest Airlines shares climbed after the airlines had few important interruptions during the weekend after the threat of a workers’ strike.

121;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-22T13:54:10Z;Maytag and Whirlpool announce $2.7bn merger;;Whirlpool and Maytag on Monday announced a $2.7bn merger that would create the world’s largest household appliance maker by sales, provided its wins regulatory approval from US antitrust authorities.The two US companies announced the deal after a private equity group led by Ripplewood Holdings failed to surpass a cash-and-stock offer from Whirlpool that values Maytag’s shares at $21 each, and assumes $977m in Maytag debt.Whirlpool and Maytag had combined sales in 2004 of $17.9bn, compared with $16.4bn for Sweden’s Electrolux.Whirlpool launched its bid for Maytag last month, seeking to break up the Ripplewood-led group’s previous agreement to acquire the company for $14 per share. After rejecting two offers, Maytag’s management said on August 12 that it preferred the Whirlpool’s bid, despite possible regulatory hurdles, giving Ripplewood until yesterday to respond.The Ripplewood-led group, which includes RHJ International, GS Capital Partners and J.Rothschild received a $40m termination fee, paid by Whirlpool.Timothy Collins, Ripplewood’s chief executive, said in a statement that the group had “carefully considered all our options” and decided not to match Whirlpool’s offer or submit a new bid for Maytag.The deal will now face intense regulatory scrutiny by Washington antitrust authorities at either the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice, which share jurisdiction over antitrust matters.Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool’s chief executive officer, said he believed the merger “will create very substantial benefits for consumers, trade customers and our shareholders”.“We remain highly confident that we will receive regulatory clearance for this transaction in a timely manner,” he said.A combined Whirlpool and Maytag would control 74 per cent of the electric dryer market, 72 per cent of the washer market and 81 per cent of the gas dryers market, according to research by Lehman Brothers analyst Andrew Whittaker.Whirlpool said in regulatory filings that “brand share” was the relevant measure antitrust authorities should use in determining the combined market share of the companies - a measure that would exclude the Kenmore brand from an antitrust review. Whirlpool manufactures appliances for Kenmore, a brand owned by Sears. Excluding the brand would bring the combined market share of the combined company to below 50 per cent in each major appliance category, Whirlpool has said.Antitrust experts say the company could face significant divestiture requirements, either of manufacturing facilities or brands. The company’s four largest customers - the retailers Sears, Lowes, Best Buy and Home Depot - are also likely to weigh in on the matter as part of a broad regulatory review.Whirlpool’s $21 per share offer reflects the risks of the deal being blocked by US antitrust regulators, and Whirlpool has said it is prepared to pay Maytag a $120m fee if that were to happen.Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy firm, said it considered the deal would have a 50 per cent chance of being approved by regulators when it threw its weight behind the Whirlpool bid earlier this month.ISS concluded that Ripplewood’s was in effect worth $13.77, while the bid from Whirlpool, heavily discounted because of the regulatory risk, was worth $15.35.Maytag shareholders will receive $10.50 in cash for each share, and between 0.1144 and 0.1398 of a share of Whirlpool stock, according to a formula based upon the share’s average market price during a 20 day period prededing the merger.Maytag’s shares were down less than one per cent in New York at lunchtime at $18.61, while Whirlpool’s shares fell one per cent to $80.78.Haier, a Chinese appliance maker, last month withdrew its earlier bid for Maytag, made with Bain Capital, and Blackstone Management.Whirlpool’s advisor is Greenhill, a New York-based merger and restructuring firm. Maytag’s advisers are Wachtell Lipton and Lazard. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank have been advising Ripplewood.
122;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-12T21:21:38Z;Maytag declares Whirlpool offer ‘superior’;;Maytag, the appliance maker, on Friday declared an improved $1.68bn, or $21 a share, offer from Whirlpool, its larger rival, “superior” to a rival bid from a private equity group led by Ripplewood Holdings of $14 a share, or $1.13bn.The shift in favour of Whirlpool, whose offer still faces scrutiny from US anti-trust regulators, leaves Ripplewood with five days to respond with an improved offer or see Whirlpool move towards a deal.Whirlpool launched its attempt to break up an agreed deal with Ripplewood last month and raised its offer three times before securing Maytag’s approval. Ripplewood would collect a $40m break-up fee if Whirlpool succeeds.Whirlpool, the US market leader in appliances, offered more for Maytag because of the risk that US antitrust regulators could seek to block the deal on competition grounds. Whirlpool has said it was prepared to pay Maytag a $120m fee if that were to happen.Maytag, owner of the Hoover brand, is the fourth largest US appliance maker. A takeover by Whirlpool would give the combined group a market share in excess of 50 per cent in certain products.Earlier on Friday, Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy firm, threw its weight behind Whirlpool, and said it considered that such a deal would have a 50 per cent chance of being approved by antitrust regulators.ISS recommended that Maytag investors vote against the agreed Ripplewood deal, which Maytag shareholders were due to have voted on next Friday.In analysing the competing offers, ISS concluded that Ripplewood’s was in effect worth $13.77, while the bid from Whirlpool, heavily discounted because of US government opposition, was worth $15.35.The small gap identified by the ISS could encourage Ripplewood to raise its offer in order to turn approval back in its favour.Before the announcement, Maytag shares closed up 1.17 per cent at $19.
123;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-12T17:38:57Z;Wall Street trendless as M&A activity boosts hopes;;US equities lacked a clear trend this week as heavyweight stocks gained on merger activity but technology blue-chips were hit by disappointing earnings releases.This week’s initial public offerings and merger and acquisitions announcements showed that sentiment remained strong, analysts said. “IPO and M&A activity doesn’t occur in bear markets. Those actions tell me we are still in an up phase,” said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbuaum in New York.On the negative side, record high oil prices and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone on the economy kept the markets in check. “The price of energy and the Fed remaining measured beyond August leaves me some concern that the markets can be constrained from having an aggressive upside target.” Mr Hyman said. Although he has not changed his forecasts for the equity markets, those factors have prevented him raising estimates any further.By midday on Friday, the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.0 per cent at 2,151.97. The S&P 500 was at 1,231.30, down 0.5 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 10,626.18, down 0.6 per cent.On the week, the indices were mixed, with the Nasdaq Composite down 1.2 per cent, while the S&P gained 0.4 per cent. The Dow was also up 0.4 per cent.Two US technology heavyweights announced disappointing earnings this week, starting with internet equipment maker Cisco Systems. The company reported increased second-quarter earnings, but gave subdued guidance for the third quarter. Shares in the company dropped 7.7 per cent on the week to $17.81The second hit in technology earnings came from computer maker Dell, which said on Friday that earnings increased, but came in below analysts expectations.

124;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-10T23:43:37Z;Lex: Whirlpool/Maytag;;A buyer bidding against himself is every auctioneer's dream. Since entering the battle for Maytag, domestic appliance maker Whirlpool has raised three times with no new bids from rival suitor Ripplewood. Yet it is not as bizarre as it seems. Wednesday’s increase to $21 a share appears to have come in response to Ripplewood's plan to raise its bid from $14 to $15.50.More importantly, Whirlpool has needed to convince the Maytag board that it is offering enough to offset the risk of regulators blocking the deal. At best, it will close next year. At worst, it will not close at all. Ripplewood in contrast is offering cash, now.The Maytag board is right to worry. A combined group would have uncomfortably high market shares, particularly in the laundry segment. Arguably, barriers to entry are low for Asian domestic appliances makers, and retailers such as Home Depot are big enough to look after themselves. However, strong brands and distribution clout are important. In fact, Whirlpool has tacitly admitted the scale of the regulatory risk by offering such a premium to Ripplewood's bid.If Whirlpool wins, the regulatory process could drag well into next year. If the deal were then blocked, Whirlpool would pay Maytag $120m. But the delay could have caused serious damage to Maytag's business. Its shares are now trading at $19 a 10 per cent discount to Whirlpool's offer. If Whirlpool is not forced higher, that feels too narrow to justify the risks involved.
125;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-10T22:31:55Z;Maytag battle intensifies as Whirlpool lifts bid;;Whirlpool, raised its offer for rival appliance maker Maytag for the second time in a week, as the long-running takeover battle entered a crucial phase.Whirlpool, which is trying to break an existing deal for Maytag to be acquired by Ripplewood, the buy-out group, for $1.13bn, increased the valueof its bid to $1.68bn or $21 a share in an equal mix of cash and stock.The latest move by Whirlpool could tilt the balance decisively in its favour. On Wednesday night, Ripplewood was still undecided on how it might respond, but appeared increasingly frustrated with the turn of events and despondent about its chances, said people close to the situation.The private equity group would collect a $40m break-up fee if its offer were to fail. Whirlpool's latest increase came after Ripplewood, whose offer is worth $14 a share in cash, privately told Maytag it was prepared to lift its bid to about $15.50 a share, according to people familiar with the matter.It was unclear on Wednesday night whether that informal offer from Ripplewood still stood following Whirlpool's revised bid.The suitors are hoping to win over the backing of Maytag's board ahead of a shareholder vote on the Ripplewood deal scheduled for August 19.Whirlpool, the US market leader in appliances, is offering more for Maytag because of the risk that US antitrust regulators could seek to block the deal on competition grounds.Maytag, owner of the Hoover brand, is the fourth largest US appliance maker. A takeover by Whirlpool would give the combined group a market share in excess of 50 per cent in certain products.So far, Whirlpool has not pledged to take on the risk that the deal would be blocked on competition grounds, but said it was prepared to pay Maytag a $120m fee if that were to happen.Maytag shares rose 1.9 per cent to $19 as Wall Street investors continued to bet that Whirlpool's bid would prevail.Whirlpool joined the takeover battle for Maytag last month,at a time when Ripplewood's deal was already threatened by an indicative offer from Haier,the Chinese appliance maker.Haier, backed by private equity groups Bain Capital and Blackstone, decided not to submit a formal offer, leaving Whirlpool as the only challenger to Ripplewood.Whirlpool has now raised its offer three times, an acknowledgment of the scepticism that has greeted its arguments that it can overcome regulatory hurdles. Its first bid was worth $17 a share.The dynamics of the takeover battle mirror two struggles for corporate control in the US this year where an agreed deal at a lower price was challenged by a rival bid at a nominally higher price but with greater risk, say merger and acquisition bankers.MCI, the US telecommunications company, chose to accept a lower offer from Verizon Communications in the face of a higher bid from the heavily indebted Qwest Communications.Unocal chose Chevron despite CNOOC, the Chinese energy company, placing a higher offer. The US oil and gas group believed there was a chance the US government could block a deal with CNOOC on national security grounds.
126;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-08T20:26:36Z;Wall St weaker despite flurry of merger talk;;Shares on Wall Street got off to a hesitant start on Monday as investors focused on a flurry of bid and merger activity in both the US and in Europe.With earnings announcements slowing, the equity markets also looked to the Federal Reserve meeting, beginning on Tuesday, for more direction on the US economy in the near term.“We do believe the Fed is going to continue to hike rates, but also think that there is a risk that they are overshooting a bit, so we may get a slowdown in the economy,”said Sheryl King, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.For this reason, Ms King believes a portfolio focused on defensives rather than cyclical stocks is a better place to invest right now.But some analysts are saying that the current merger activity has made them confident in equity investments.“One of the reasons that we have been comfortable having equities is because the markets seem poised for high potential for M&A activity,” said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank.With the credit markets accommodating, and companies willing to take on balance sheet risk, companies are ready for more acquisitions, he said.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent, at 10,536.93, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,164.39. The S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent to 1,223.13.Merger reports flooded the market with oil and gas company Kerr-McGee agreeing to sell its North Sea oil interests to Denmark’s Moller-Maersk for $3.5bn. Shares rose 3.7 per cent to $85.01.Appliance maker Whirlpool offered a sweetened bid for rival Maytag, taking its offer up $2 a share to $20. Maytag gained 9.4 per cent to $18.58, while Whirlpool rose 3.5 per cent to $82.46.In further merger and acquisition activity, E*Trade said it would acquire the online brokerage operations of Harrisdirect for $700m. E*Trade was up 8.3 per cent to $16.10.A UK newspaper reported that Cisco Systems was in talks to acquire mobile telephone maker Nokia. Nokia later denied the report, but the stock was up 0.9 per cent to $16.08. Cisco was down 0.3 per cent to $19.25.Department store owner Saks was up 9.1 per cent to $22.10 after publication Women’s Wear Daily reported that Bon-Ton Stores and Cerberus Capital Management may buy the company for as much as $4.2bn.Meanwhile, auto parts supplier Delphi said the company would consider filing for bankruptcy. The company released earnings later in the session, but the stock was up 1.4 per cent to $5.03. Visteon, the rival US car manufacturer, reported a second quarter net loss, but the stock shot up 15.8 per cent to $9.85.China’s latest technology IPO, internet search portal Baidu.com, closed down 5.8 per cent to $115.50.
127;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-08-08T16:55:07Z;Whirlpool lifts Maytag offer to $20 a share;;Whirlpool on Monday increased its offer to buy smaller rival Maytag by $2 to $20 a share, including a $120m “break-up” fee payable to Maytag should the combination not win antitrust approval.The move appeared to be a sign that Whirlpool wanted to quickly assure Maytag shareholders that it was prepared to use financial support to back its belief that a combined Whirlpool/Maytag would pass antitrust scrutiny.The offer includes a commitment to pay a further $15m “for retention of Maytag employees”.Whirlpool’s proposal trumps an agreed offer of $14 a share from a consortium led by private equity firm Ripplewood.The development sent Maytag’s shares almost 10 per cent higher at $18.66 by midday in New York.This was the second time that Whirlpool had raised its offer. Last month it added $1 to an existing offer of $17 a share.Whirlpool has said there is “no plausible concern” about a combination of the largest and fourth-largest global appliance makers. It says the new company would not have more than a 50 per cent market share in any one product category.Yet critics say this fails to take account of the Kenmore-branded appliances made by Whirlpool for department store Sears.Whether antitrust authorities would consider Kenmore in their calculations of market share is seen by analysts as a key factor in any antitrust probe.Whirlpool also argues that the US appliance market has become more competitive in the last 10 years as Asian manufacturers such as LG and Samsung have made inroads into the market.Ripplewood is understood to believe that the impact of such competitors has been exaggerated, pointing out that some rely on domestic US appliance makers for their service networks.Laura Champine, analyst at Morgan Keegan, said any decision by antitrust authorities “could go either way”.“Ripplewood has a point in that regulators tend to do market-share calculations and doing that alone will make it tough [for Whirlpool]. Whirlpool has a point in that there’s no viable opposition to the deal getting done given that retailers have said they have no position on the deal, or that they agree with Whirlpool.”
128;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-27T20:31:44Z;Whirlpool and Maytag strike due diligence deal;;"Whirlpool has signed a confidentiality agreement giving the US appliance maker access to the books of Maytag, its smaller rival, which faced mounting concerns about the effect on its business and employees of an increasingly bitter takeover battle.Whirlpool, after bidding $1.44bn, or $18 a share, in cash and stock last week for Maytag, has been making headway in its attempt to break up an agreed deal for Maytag to be acquired by Ripplewood Holdings, a buy-out firm, for $1.13bn, or $14 a share, in cash.Wednesday's move to allow ""due diligence"" came after Maytag's board on Sunday said that Whirlpool's offer might lead to a better deal, in part shrugging off concerns that US antitrust regulators might try to block a merger on competition grounds. A key focus of the discussions between the companies in coming days will centre on how they might share the antitrust risk, insiders said.Meanwhile, Ripplewood, which had already opposed talks between Maytag and China's Haier, a third bidder that withdrew last week, has grown uneasy about the release of sensitive information to another key competitor. ""Haier was given staggering access to the company's plans, to new products, even plant visits. Now they will go away armed to be even more competitive,"" said one person familiar with the situation.""Not only does this make Maytag a much harder company to fix but it also damages the economics for Ripplewood."" There were also heightened concerns about the fate of Maytag's employees. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents some about 4,000 Maytag workers, on Tuesday asked the company's board to reject any sale that would lead to widespread job losses.Ripplewood has already indicated that Maytag's talks with Haier and Whirlpool allow it to walk away from the deal and collect a $40m break-up fee, a claim Maytag rejects.But afterWednesday's developments, Ripplewood might be considering more aggressive legal tactics, according to people close to the situation.""Ripplewood is analysing its remedies for what it considers a potential breach of contract,"" one person said. On Wednesday, shares in Maytag, which makes Hoover vacuum cleaners, were up 0.5 per cent at $16.93."
129;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-25T13:44:22Z;Dow unable to make headway;;Investors on Wall Street on Monday struggled to find upward momentum amid a raft of mixed earnings reports and mergers and acquisitions news.With little on the economic calendar until later in the week, earnings provided the focus for investors in trading Monday.But mixed second quarter reports from some US blue-chips left some investors concerned, with earnings reports thus far showing slower earnings growth compared with last quarter.By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent at 10,596.48. The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,229.03, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6 per cent at 2,166.74.The broader market’s flat performance followed a week of modest gains by the S&P 500, which hit a four-year high in spite of increased security fears following the failed bomb attacks in London last week.“I would certainly characterise earnings as more good news that bad news,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries Co, but Mr Hogan said overall earnings this season had showed slowing earnings growth, with the basket of companies increasing only 8 per cent from last year compared to 10 per cent in the previous quarter.“the aggregate is significantly below first quarter and that is beginningto creep into the market’s psyche”.Still, Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, hailed an improvement in sales figures this quarter. “Margins are still wide, and in some cases widening. It looks like a much more sustainable earnings cycle when it’s driven by top-line growth,” he said.Xerox, the copier and printer maker, fell 6 per cent to $13.20 after it reported disappointing earnings and issued cautious third quarter guidance.A huge one-off tax gain doubled the group’s net income for the quarter, but underlying earnings failed to match expectations.Shares in financial services and credit card provider American Express were flat at $54.56 after the group said profits rose 16 per cent in the second quarter.BellSouth, the third largest telecommunications company, was up 0.3 per cent to $26.81. Second-quarter earnings fell 20 per cent because of costs associated with the acquisition of AT&T Wireless by its Cingular joint venture. Excluding those costs, and including its 40 per cent share of Cingular, the group earned 46 cents a share, compared with expectations of 43 cents a share.Two of the biggest US appliance makers received a boost after Maytag said it would consider a sweetened takeover bid from Whirlpool.The new $18-a-share bid topped Whirlpool’s earlier offer of $17 a share, which Maytag had rejected in favour of a $14-a-share offer from Ripplewood Holdings, the buyout group.Maytag shares climbed 4.9 per cent to $17.00, while Whirlpool gained 7.1 per cent to $82.68.In other merger and acquisitions news, Teva Pharmaceutical, the Israeli generic drugs manufacturer, said it was in advanced talks to buy Ivax, a maker of asthma treatments, in a deal worth about $7.4bn. The news sent shares in Ivax up 10 per cent to $25.17.Energy shares led gainers on the S&P, with Halliburton, the oilfield contractor, up 2.9 per cent to $54.86.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, was the biggest laggard on the Dow, with shares down 1.0 per cent.Texas Instruments, the maker of analog computer chips, slipped 0.2 per cent to $30.71 ahead of its quarterly earnings report, due out after the closing bell.
130;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-24T19:27:43Z;Oil prices pump up costs;;As rising oil prices bite, international manufacturers are finding innovative and sometimes painful ways of coping with the impact on their raw material and energy bills.As the impact of increasing costs ripples through the supply chain, companies can feel the pinch in almost any industry.The most dramatic example came on Friday when Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, announced 6,000 job cuts to offset the rising cost of paper fibres and resin used in plastic packaging.Both commodities are heavily influenced by the price of oil and their increasing cost in the second quarter almost entirely wiped out $55m of savings the company had tried to find from other areas.Days earlier, International Paper was forced to rip apart its business model and put $8bn-$10bn worth of assets up for sale in response to a price squeeze of its own.The world's second-largest private landowner is a major harvester of the wood pulp that produces tissue and nappy fibres, but it has suffered from the rising price of production chemicals and transport costs also associated with oil.Though some of this inflation can be passed on to customers in the way Kimberly-Clark experienced, much cannot, and International Paper has had to take tough decisions about which markets it can afford to stay in.Elsewhere, manufacturers representing a range of sectors from Whirlpool in home appliances to United Technologies in air conditioning and Kraft in the food industry, all made similar warnings last week about the impact rising commodity costs were having on profits.“It's a shock to the system for anyone who makes products with metals or plastic and who has logistics costs,” said Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool chairman.It would be wrong to assume that such complaints represent a crisis for manufacturing. For many companies, pricing power does still allow them to pass on rising raw material costs.Clayt Daley, finance director of Procter & Gamble, said: “I think we are in an environment right now where you can raise prices to recover commodities that are affecting your industry. We have done it. In most cases, but not all, the competition has chosen to raise prices as well.”General Electric, the world's largest manufacturer, also said it was managing to stay ahead of commodity cost inflation in markets such as plastics that have often looked to be most vulnerable of all.To some extent, commodity inflation is one of those challenges to industry that helps sort the men from the boys. Companies with strong brands or disciplined management can weather the storm far better than those in weak market positions.But there are lessons for all businesses in the way manufacturers have managed to cope.In P&G's case, it is increasingly turning to financial hedging as a way of smoothing out the volatility of raw material costs. The consumer goods group buys little crude oil itself, but is looking at ways to hedge the cost of products further down the petrochemicals stream such as the resins that go into bottles and packaging.Koch Industries, a privately held industrial and oil trading group based in Kansas, confirmed it was in discussions with P&G about offering risk management products for such plastics.Thomas Falk, chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, said it too was looking at insulating itself from volatility in the price of fibres, probably by using the recently-created pulp futures contracts at the New York Board of Trade.Of course, hedging can only offer a temporary cushion. The reason that oil prices are beginning to bite is not just that they are up 40 per cent from a year ago, but because they have stayed high for several quarters.Companies such as Honey-well believe continuous productivity improvement, even in boom times, is the only way to prepare for unexpected price shocks. It recently announced 2,000 job cuts in its aerospace division even though business is doing well and pricing power has allowed it to pass on higher raw material costs.“It's easier to do this with the wind at our back,” said David Anderson, Honey-well's finance director.Most important, the rising cost of energy is not yet enough to cause significant changes in the behaviour of end consumers.Petrol prices in the US, for example, are still far below the inflation-adjusted peaks of the 1970s, and few economists expect drivers to stop filling their tanks for the sake of few dollars extra that would otherwise barely cover the cost of coffee at Starbucks.Valero, the largest independent oil refiner in the US, said the only change it had seen in consumer behaviour was that some drivers were choosing to fill up with regular rather than premium products at the pump.Doug Duncan, chief executive of FedEx Freight, the trucking division of FedEx delivery group, described how many customers were choosing to send less urgent packages by road rather than air to minimise fuel surcharges.As long as consumers remain relatively resilient, most manufacturers and industrial suppliers so far seem able to cope with oil's cost squeeze.
131;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-24T16:31:33Z;Whirlpool offer for Maytag ‘might trump agreed deal’;;Maytag, the US white-goods manufacturer, said on Sunday that an offer from Whirlpool, its larger rival, might trump an existing deal it signed in May to be taken over by Ripplewood, the US private equity group.The declaration by Maytag, which came a week after Whirlpool entered the bidding, allows the two companies to begin discussions about the terms of a deal.It will also allow Whirlpool to study Maytag's confidential financial information.Maytag last week rejected Whirlpool's initial approach, worth $1.35bn, or $17 per share. But over the weekend, in a sign of its determination, Whirlpool increased its offer to $1.44bn, or $18 per share in cash and stock.The deal on the table, which will be voted on by Maytag shareholders on August 19, calls for the company to be taken over by Ripplewood for $14 per share, or $1.13bn in cash.In deciding in Whirlpool's favour, Maytag said it had taken into account the alleged support of customers for a combination of the two companies. It had also been given sufficient assurances by Whirlpool that US antitrust regulators would not seek to block the deal on competition grounds.Neither Whirlpool nor Ripplewood had any immediate comment on Maytag's statement on Sunday, which marked another key moment in the long-running battle. For two days last week, there were three bidders for Maytag, until a consortium led by Haier, the Chinese appliance maker, announced it would not be making a formal offer for the group.Some people involved in the bid battle believed Whirlpool's motive in entering the fray could be a defensive move against the entry of a Chinese competitor into the US market. But Whirlpool's move to raise its bid after Haier's withdrawal had defused some of that criticism, they added.Ripplewood was opposed to the discussions between Maytag and the Haier group, forcing the sides to shorten them by three weeks.On Sunday, it emerged that Ripplewood is also opposed to any talks between Maytag and Whirlpool, on the grounds that they could violate the merger agreement - a claim that Maytag rejects.Ripplewood believes that it can collect its $40m break-up fee and walk away from the deal if it chooses.Maytag shares rose 3.5 per cent to $16.20 on Friday.
132;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-22T00:28:40Z;Maytag rebuffs Whirlpool bid approach;;Maytag on Thursday night rejected an approach by larger rival Whirlpool to buy the ailing appliance maker but left the door open to further contact by saying it would “continue to evaluate the Whirlpool proposal”.The decision, taken at a Maytag board meeting, deals a blow to Whirlpool’s efforts to persuade Maytag to consider opening negotiations with Whirlpool - weeks after Maytag agreed to a takeover offer from private equity firm Ripplewood.Maytag said it had been unable to determine that Whirlpool’s indicative offer to buy the company for $17 – compared to an agreed offer of $14 from Ripplewood - “may reasonably be expected to lead to a financially superior transaction that is reasonably capable of being completed”.Maytag said: “Such a determination is a prerequisite under Maytag’s existing merger agreement with the Ripplewood-led group for Maytag to furnish information to, and have discussions and negotiations with Whirlpool.”Stephen Duthie, a Whirlpool spokesman, said: “Whirlpool is still intent on looking into its proposed investment with Maytag. We will have more to say after we have a look at Maytag’s latest response.”At issue is understood to have been antitrust issues raised by the Whirlpool proposal, which envisages a combination of the largest and fourth largest appliance makers in world.Critics of the Whirlpool proposal have said they believe a combined Whirlpool/Maytag would to big a share in refrigerators, laundry washers and dryers and other appliancesFor Maytag to have proceeded to discussions with Whirlpool, its board would have had to be confident that any deal would clear antitrust hurdles. The decision not to pursue talks indicates that Maytag’s board had no such confidence.However Maytag left the door open by saying it would “continue to evaluate the Whirlpool proposal”. Industry analysts said this may mean that Maytag expects Whirlpool to assume some of the regulatory risk in any further proposal, including a commitment to divest some assets.Whirlpool earlier on Thursday had sought to allay competition concerns. Jeff Fettig, chairman, told analysts on an earnings call there was “no plausible concern” that competition would be reduced by combining with Maytag.”We believe that the dynamics that determine competition will not be changed and the same holds true across the total business as well as in any single product. In any single product category this combination would be well below 50 per cent market share,” he said.Critics say a combined Whirlpool/Maytag would have about 70 per cent of the market for laundry products if Kenmore-branded products are included. Kenmore is an own-label offering sold by Sears, the US retailer. Whirlpool makes a significant amount of products for Kenmore but does not include this in its antitrust assumptions.Mr Duthie said this was because Sears owns the Kenmore brand, while contracts to manufacture for Sears are renewed every three years. “We could stand a chance of losing that [business],” he said.However one Chicago-based antitrust lawyer unconnected with the proposed Whirlpool or Ripplewood transactions said antitrust officials would still have some concern over the possibility that a combined Whirlpool/Maytag could, by its sheer size, have some influence over Kenmore’s costs and thus over consumer pricing.“The government would look at whether this would increase the cost of the Kenmore products at Sears such that, at the retail level, a consumer may be affected by higher prices,” he said.He said Whirlpool was likely to argue that it was the big retailers, not the appliance manufacturers, that ultimately controlled pricing. The lawyer said the government, however, tended “to discount ‘power buyer’ arguments such as these”.”The competition authorities take a much closer look to make certain that a manufacturer cannot influence a rival’s costs.”Laura Champine, analyst at Morgan Keegan, said the regulatory treatment of Kenmore was likely to be “key to whether or not any merger is approved.”Whirlpool on Thursday reported a 9 per cent fall in operating profit as it struggled to offset rising energy and steel prices with price increases. Net income fell to $96m, or $1.42 per diluted share, from $106m, or $1.53.This was higher than analysts’ expectations of $1.35. Mr Fettig said steel and base metals price increases had been “a shock to the system”. But he said: “We’ve continued to drive our productivity, what we can’t control is global raw materials costs.”
133;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Margins, however, were less than expected.It was a similar story at Yahoo, which hit earnings forecasts but missed revenue targets. The internet search engine saw shares close 11.5 per cent down at $33.40. Google also fell 0.7 per cent on the news, down to $312.Analysts said the market had become overly-sensitive to poor earnings figures and that recent upward momentum would be sustained.“The earnings numbers have been getting better and better all week and that has raised expectations too high,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist, at Wells Capital Management. “Even when Yahoo met expectations it still got hit. But despite the bad headlines the market is basically unchanged.”By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had recovered and up 0.4 per cent at 10,689.15. The S&P 500, which had been down 0.3 per cent, was up 0.5 per cent at 1,235.2 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent at 2,188.57.Alan Greenspan helped dispel the market’s suddenly bearish mood when he testified to Congress. The Federal Reserve chairman said the outlook for the US economy was good and that the central bank should keep tightening interest rates.The S&P 500 was also bolstered by a good performance from the world’s largest biotechnology company. Amgen saw its share price jump by 15 per cent to $81.17 after reporting a 38 per cent increase in second-quarter profit and raising its full year forecast.PepsiCo shares slipped after Dominique de Villepin, the French prime minister, condemned speculation that the soft-drink maker was ready to take over Danone, the French food group.Mr Villepin said he would defend the interests of one of the “flowers of our industry”. Danone shares rose in Paris, while PepsiCo’s fell 1.7 per cent to $54.60.Eastman Kodak fell 2.2 per cent to $28.10. The world’s largest photography company announced its third consecutive quarterly loss, saying it would cut 10,000 more jobs.Maytag shares fell 11 per cent to $15.61 after Chinese company Haier announced it had given up trying to takeover the US appliance maker. Shares in Whirlpool, which offered $1.35bn earlier in the week, were up 0.9 per cent at $76.10.
135;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-20T02:37:50Z;Haier drops out of bidding for Maytag;;A consortium led by Haier, the Chinese appliance maker, on Tuesday night told Maytag that it would not submit a formal offer for the US manufacturer of Hoover vacuum cleaners.Haier's withdrawal from the bidding left Ripplewood Holdings, the private equity group, and Whirlpool, the largest US white goods maker, competing for control of Maytag.In a statement, Maytag said it received a letter from Haier and bidding partners Bain Capital and Blackstone, the buy-out groups, stating that they had decided “not to further pursue the transaction to acquire the outstanding shares of Maytag.”No explanation was provided, but people familiar with the matter said the Haier consortium had concluded that a formal offer for Maytag would probably be too costly.The three companies had submitted an indicative proposal last month to buy Maytag for $16 per share, or $1.28bn, threatening a deal agreed in May for the Iowa-based manufacturer to be acquired by Ripplewood for $14 per share, or $1.13bn. Whirlpool entered the fray on Monday when it made an initial offer to buy Maytag for $17 per share, or $1.35bn.Maytag is expected to hold a board meeting on Thursday at which it could decide whether to grant Whirlpool access to its financial information, according to people familiar with the matter. The main point that will be debated is whether Whirlpool's bid is likely to be blocked by US antitrust regulators.Haier's presence among the bidders was seen as evidence of the new prowess of Chinese companies. CNOOC, the state-owned Chinese energy group, is attempting to break up a $16.5bn agreed takeover of Unocal by Chevron, the US oil major.Maytag shares closed at $17.53 on Tuesday.
136;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-19T16:53:01Z;Electrolux hit by cost of raw materials;;Electrolux, the household appliance maker, on Tuesday reiterated that full-year profits would be slightly below 2004 levels and said it would keep on downsizing after unveiling second-quarter pre-tax profits that remained squeezed by high raw material costs.Hans Straberg, chief executive, said: “We were able to raise prices in several markets, but this could not fully compensate for the substantial cost increases.”In the three months to June 30, pre-tax profits fell 2.5 per cent to just under SKr1.7bn ($218m) from SKr1.74bn in the second quarter of 2004, despite sales growth of 6.3 per cent to SKr34bn. Operating margins dropped to 5.6 per cent from 6.8 per cent.Electrolux B shares closed up 5.1 per cent at SKr175, partly because profits were ahead of an expected SKr1.19bn for the quarter.“By reiterating its forecasts after one more quarter of visibility and stating that raw material costs would rise by a net SKr2bn this year, less than we anticipated, Electrolux has removed the threat of a profit warning,” said Anders Trapp, analyst at Enskilda Securities.Competition, especially from Asia, together with spiralling raw material costs has also prompted industry consolidation, such as this week's bidding war for US Maytag by buy-out firm Ripplewood and rival appliance makers Haier of China and Whirlpool of the US.While Electrolux has grown to its present size through acquisitions, it is not expected to join the fray over Maytag.Since Mr Straberg took over as CEO in 2002, Electrolux has let go of more operations than it has bought, mainly units thought of as non-core or loss-making.Last week, it sold three unprofitable Indian units and in February it laid out a plan to divest its most profitable but non-core Outdoor Products Unit, valued at over half its total market capitalisation of roughly SKr50bn, by summer 2006.“The restructuring they're undertaking right now is monumental,” added Mr Trapp. “It takes a lot of focus to achieve the targeted SKr8bn-SKr10bn plan to cut jobs and move a third of production to low-cost countries by 2008, at the same time improving the product offering and divesting the outdoor products unit by next year.“With interest rates low, private equity companies have access to enough funding to make large deals every week. But, if anything, Whirlpool's bid for Maytag shows that one shouldn't exclude an industrial buyer for Outdoor Products.”
137;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-19T12:31:50Z;Lex: Maytag;;Ripplewood should demand a finder’s fee. Since the private equity group spotted an opportunity in Maytag, two more suitors have approached the once unloved domestic appliance manufacturer. Ripplewood, however, lacks the weapons of the trade bidders pitched against it.Whirlpool in particular should be able to squeeze attractive synergies out of Maytag. It could optimise manufacturing across a larger base of factories. That might include US closures, given the potential for shifting more of Maytag’s high cost manufacturing abroad. Better purchasing scale would cut raw material costs. There would be overhead savings. And Whirlpool’s research and development could help improve Maytag’s brands.Ripplewood has other strengths, but lacks the synergies. Haier, the Chinese appliance maker, and its private equity backers, have less potential for cost savings than Whirlpool, given the small US overlap with Maytag.But Whirlpool’s bid will face serious regulatory scrutiny, given high combined market shares in certain products. Even though industry competition is fierce and the few retailers dominating US appliance sales are arguably strong enough to look after themselves, the approval process could be risky and time-consuming. In addition, Maytag must decide if it prefers cash or a stake in the future through some Whirlpool paper. Haier or Ripplewood might yet push their bids higher. But Maytag’s assessment of the anti-trust risks is likely to be pivotal in shaping the final outcome.
138;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-18T18:13:11Z;Citigroup takes wind out of Wall Street’s sails;;Wall Street came under early pressure on Monday after Citigroup announced an underpar second-quarter performance.The bank said its results were affected by rising interest rates and a difficult environment for fixed-income trading. Citigroup shares fell 2.5 per cent to $45.26.After the S&P rallied to new bull-market highs last week, it fell back yesterday to 1,224.28 – a fall of 0.3 per cent. By mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones was also down 0.3 per cent at 10,609.94 and the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 per cent to 2,149.55.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, was optimistic, despite the market’s early slide.“There has been a bit of profit-taking and perhaps some apprehension about today’s earnings, but the fact that the S&P hit a four-year high last Friday is a demonstration that investors are optimistic about this week’s earnings news.”There was better earnings news from Bank of America and MBNA, which both topped expectations. However, shares in Bank of America, which agreed to acquire MBNA for $35bn last month, were down 1.5 per cent at $45.27.A good performance by Charles Schwab was rewarded by its shares rising 4.8 per cent to $13.35 after the discount brokerage announced an increase in quarterly profits.3M, the technology conglomerate, and another Dow component company reporting results yesterday, said second-quarter earnings were higher and revenue met forecasts. Shares fell 0.7 per cent to $74.93.By mid-afternoon, industrial stocks were given a lift by rising oil prices after weather experts said Hurricane Emily would skirt oil fields off the south Texas coast.On the Nymex energy market crude for August delivery was trading $1.09 at $57 per barrel after sliding to an earlier low of $56.80.Eaton was one of the best performers in the S&P after the world’s second-biggest maker of hydraulic equipment said its second-quarter earnings climbed 30 per cent and raised its full year forecasts. Shares in the company rose 7.7 per cent to $66.83.Airlines were also bolstered by the slip in oil prices. The Amex airline index gained 1.2 per cent to 51.50 while the best performing airline stocks were Delta, which gained 2.6 per cent to $3.95, and Southwest Airlines which was up 2 per cent to $14.49.The fading popularity of Barbie dolls lowered second-quarter earnings at Mattel, which said it expected the rest of the year to be challenging. The toymaker’s shares were down 2.4 per cent at $18.99.Whirlpool said that it had offered to buy rival Maytag for more than $1.3bn, beating an existing offer for the maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners and possibly beginning a bidding war. Whirlpool gained 4.8 per cent to $73.38, while Maytag gained 12.9 per cent to $17.45.
139;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-07-18T17:02:47Z;Maytag considers Whirlpool bid as share soar;;"Maytag said on Monday it would “consider“ an unsolicited approach from Whirlpool worth about $1.4bn, as shares in the US appliance maker now at the centre of a three-way takeover battle soared more than 13 per cent.For now, Maytag, which makes the Hoover vacuum cleaner, said it would continue to stick with a deal agreed in May to be bought by Ripplewood Holdings, the US private equity group, for $1.13bn in cash.But the company added that, “in accordance with its duties“, Maytag's board would need to study the initial proposal from Whirlpool - the largest player in the US white goods market.At $17 per share, Whirlpool's offer would be higher than either Ripplewood's, worth $14 per share, or an indicative offer worth $16 per share placed last month by China's Haier and buy-out groups Bain Capital and Blackstone. Wall Street investors were on Monday betting that Whirlpool's move would spark a bidding war. In New York, Maytag shares were trading up 13 per cent at $17.48, or above the level of all three potential transactions.Meanwhile, Whirlpool was laying out its case for a takeover of Maytag on a conference call. Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool chairman and chief executive, said the emergence of more appliance companies in the region required ""Whirlpool and other companies to compete vigorously"".""The prospect of a revitalised Maytag brand enhances competition,"" he said. ""We think it's a great strategic fit, we believe its pro-competitive and it's the best solution to address Maytag's business challenges.""Laura Champine, analyst at Morgan Keegan, said the combination could raise antitrust concerns in the US, with the combined group taking a market share of 65 per cent share in laundry appliances, and an almost 50 per cent share in appliances overall.However Whirlpool said it there was ""no plausible concern that competition would be reduced"".Mr Fettig said this was because the number of retailers stocking appliances had grown rapidly in recent years.""There are five manufacturers supplying [US retailer] Sears. There are a large number of competitors that can compete at any time for that part of the business,"" he said.Asian appliance makers such as Haier and South Korea's LG Group, have increased their market share in the US appliance market recently.Whirlpool's global presence would allow it rapidly to integrate Maytag into its manufacturing network, while Maytag's brands - including Jenn-Air kitchen appliances - would complement those of Whirlpool, Mr Fettig said.It was unclear whether Whirlpool would be granted immediate access to Maytag's confidental financial information. The Haier group's hopes of being able to perform “due diligence“ on Maytag until mid-August were dashed after objections from Ripplewood forced Maytag to insist the discussions be completed by the end of this week."
140;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-05-23T20:18:49Z;Energy stocks help Wall Street higher;;Rising shares in energy companies led US stock indices higher on Monday, with Apple Computer rising on reports that it was in with Intel about a potential microchip deal.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51.65 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 10,523.56. The broader S&P 500 rose 4.58 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 1,193.86, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 10.23 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,056.65.Monday’s performance followed last week’s strong showing in the wake of tame US inflation figures, falling oil prices and easing fears that protectionist sentiment in the US could spark a trade war with China.Bill Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital, a Seattle-based short-selling fund, said that although it was tempting to attribute short-term changes in the direction of the stock market to bits and pieces of economic news, hedge funds could be contributing to Wall Street’s recent swings.Some hedge funds are rumoured to have been hit hard by widening credit spreads and unexpected moves in the share and bond prices of Ford Motor and General Motors, the big US carmakers.“There are 8,000 hedge funds out there, and some of them are hurting,” Mr Fleckenstein said. “They’re flailing around and you can’t be sure where the money is going.”Word of Intel’s talks with Apple Computer garnered the most attention in early trading. Shares in Apple rose 5.9 per cent by the close to $39.76 amid expectations that a deal to use Intel computer chips could make its prices more competitive with other computer rivals. Intel shares rose 0.6 per cent.Campbell Soup, the food company, rose 1.6 per cent to $30.82 after its results beat estimates for the quarter. It reported earnings of 35 cents a share, beating estimates of 33 cents.Energy groups led gainers as oil prices regained ground following a sell-off last week. ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil refiner, received an upgrade from Sanford C Bernstein, and its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $54.75.Auto components groups Visteon and Delphi were among the day’s biggest losers. Shares in Visteon fell 3.8 per cent to $6.27 after gaining more than 80 per cent on Friday amid reports that the company was close to a deal to sell some unprofitable factories back to Ford, its erstwhile parent. Delphi led decliners on the S&P with shares down 4.6 per cent.Maytag, the appliance maker, rose 6.9 per cent to $15.39 as speculators priced in the possibility of a counterbid to rival last week’s $14 per share buyout offer from Ripplewood Holding, a private equity group.Shares in Whirlpool, a Maytag rival, rose 1.1 per cent to $68.98.General Motors fell 1.2 per cent, while rival Ford Motor climbed 1.7 per cent to $10.17.
141;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-05-20T14:08:10Z;Maytag shares up 24% after Ripplewood offer;;Shares in Maytag Corporation, which makes commercial and home appliances such as the Hoover vacuum cleaner, jumped more than 24 per cent in New York on Friday after an investor group led by Ripplewood Holdings agreed to acquire the company for $2.1bn.The move also pushed Electrolux shares higher on Friday on hopes that the Swedish group may itself become a bid target. The shares were up 4.6 per cent at SFr158.5 in afternoon trading in Europe.The Maytag deal, at $14 per share, follows a long slump in the value and performance of the Iowa-based manufacturer, whose shares were trading close to $50 each in mid-2002. Maytag shares moved ahead of the buy-out offer, rising more than 24 per cent by late afternoon in New York to $14.37.The purchase by Ripplewood, most famous for its investments in the depressed Japanese economy of the 1990s, underscores how private money is starting to find targets in the struggling US industrial heartland.“Certainly we have some structural issues, such as Asia and structural costs, and it is going to take us two to three years to work through them,” said Ralph Hake, Maytag's chief executive, in an interview with the FT.Mr Hake, who will continue to run Maytag after the takeover by Ripplewood, added that the company would be easier to turn round in private hands.Maytag's board, which formed an independent committee to consider Ripplewood's offer, agreed to sell at a 21 per cent premium over its closing share price of $11.56 on Thursday. Ripplewood will also be taking on about $975m of Maytag debt, which in April was cut to “junk” status by all three big rating agencies.Before Thursday's deal, the company had been negotiating new credit facilities to refinance part of its debt and fund restructuring expenses, but had not reached an agreement with the banks. Maytag has about $4.8bn in annual revenues, and 20,000 employees around the world.On its website, the company traces its roots back to 1893 when F.L. Maytag started manufacturing farm implements. In 1907, he produced his first wooden-tub washing machine, which would serve as a model for one of the most popular home appliances of the 20th century. But the white goods market has become fiercely competitive, while most of its production base is still in North America.Maytag last June unveiled a restructuring involving a 20 per cent cut in its salaried workforce. Over 95 per cent of Maytag's workforce was based in the US at that time.By contrast, rival Whirlpool began shifting its production to low-cost regions such as Asia over a decade ago. Its shares closed at $65.51.Timothy Collins, Ripplewood's founder and chief executive, said his objective was “to take action to become a low-cost producer and accelerate growth by introducing innovative new products, expanding its presence in international markets and pursuing selective acquisitions”.The other members of the consortium are RHJ International, which is Ripplewood's European partner, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and J Rothschild.This month Maytag cut its dividend by 50 per cent as it looked to fund its restructuring plans and have additional cash for operations. Lazard advised Maytag. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank advised Ripplewood.
142;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Soaring material costs give manufacturers raw deal;;When Hayes Lemmerz, the biggest maker of steel and aluminium wheels for cars, emerged from bankruptcy in 2003, it hoped for a bright future as a stronger and more competitive company.But it did not foresee the steel crisis that would ensue as demand from China's expanding economy pushed prices to record levels. Although prices have since dropped, hot-rolled coil steel is still trading at about $650-$700 a tonne, double its levels of late 2003.The higher prices have raised Hayes Lemmerz's manufacturing costs, hurt its revenues, contributed to a 57 per cent fall in its share price last year and made fulfilling contracts difficult, said, Curtis Clawson, its chief executive. “It's going to get a little bit worse in 2005,” he warned last month. Hayes is not the only company struggling. Across America, firms are battling with the high cost of wood products, copper, aluminium, cement, plastics and chemicals.Homebuilders are among the worst hit. Fitch Ratings estimates the increase in wood and metal prices from a year ago could add $6,800-$7,500 to the cost of building an averaged-sized home.“We've seen more inflation [in building materials costs] in 2004 than we've seen in quite some time,” said Robert Curran, a senior director at Fitch.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said commodity price indices had risen more in this recovery cycle than in any since the 1970s when interest rates rose above 12 per cent as the Federal Reserve sought to control inflation. Today, the Fed's target funds rate is just 2.25 per cent.Although the Fed has expressed some concern about inflation, it has characterised it as a “long-term” risk. In the minutes of its most recent meeting, its policy committee said it believed inflation would remain “contained”.Meanwhile, yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds are now lower than they were at the start of 2004, suggesting investors are also complacent about inflation risks. Inflation diminishes the value of bonds and investors typically sell bonds in inflationary environments, pushing their prices lower and their yields higher.Nevertheless, the evidence is that companies are having difficulties absorbing higher commodity costs and, where possible, are starting to pass them on. When consumers buy a refrigerator, dishwasher or washing machine made by Whirlpool this year, they will be paying up to 10 per cent more than last year. Whirlpool, the biggest US manufacturer of home appliances, decided to raise prices to compensate for sharply higher raw material and transport costs.“I don't think this industry has ever seen the order of magnitude of cost increases and shortage issues with both materials and transports that we're seeing,” Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool's president and chief executive, said recently. Maytag, another home appliance manufacturer, also increased prices after being hurt by higher steel costs.Analysts say that in the past attempts by appliance makers to raise prices failed because companies would undercut one another, bringing prices back down. But higher materials costs mean all appliance makers are in the same boat. “We are seeing no sign that any of the suppliers are breaking ranks on pricing,” analysts at FTN Midwest Securities said in a research note. Sonoco Products, which creates packaging materials using paper, plastic and steel, is among the companies whose earnings have been hit by higher steel prices because it cannot pass on increases until customers renew their contracts.It has, however, raised prices for products that use other materials, such as corrugated boxes.Some of this inflation may be turn out to be good for business if manufacturers that use steel cans for food products switch to Sonoco's “composite” cans, which are made of recycled paper. “Consumer companies are going to be looking for alternative packaging,” said Harris DeLoach, Sonoco's president and chief executive.But for some, higher materials costs could have serious long-term consequences.Delphi, the world's biggest supplier of automotive parts, last month blamed higher commodity prices as one of the reasons it was forced to sack 8,500 staff and lower its revenue forecast by $200m.Industry observers say that car parts makers are finding it difficult to pass on cost increases because their customers the carmakers cannot raise prices due to intense competition.That, said John Anton, director of the steel service at economic research firm Global Insight, could force a shake-out in the car parts sector “not just in the US but globally”.
143;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2005-01-13T21:44:38Z;Rising crude price helps push Wall St lower;;"Rising oil prices pushed Wall Street lower on Thursday after a dazzling earnings report from Apple failed to breathe life into the broader market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 10,504.72, the S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,177.22 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.1 per cent to 2,070.52.The leading US indices have retreated from 3½-year highs reached last month as creeping gains in late December gave way to the trendless pattern that has characterised the early trading sessions of 2005.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said the fact that the broader markets had failed to react to a string of upbeat economic data and positive earnings reports was disappointing.""There is a lot of money on the sidelines that needs to go to work,"" he said.However, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, cautioned against viewing the market's recent sluggishness as an indication of performance in the year ahead.""Ultimately, what is more important this year is earnings each quarter,"" she said, adding that Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates would also have an impact.Apple shares shot briefly past their all-time closing high after the company dazzled investors with a four-fold increase in quarterly profits. The computer group's shares, which more than doubled in value in 2004, ended the day up 6.6 per cent at $69.80. They reached a high of $72.09 in March 2000.Richard Gardner, analyst at Citigroup Smith Barney, cautioned that Apple shares remained a risky bet in spite of their recent strong performance. In a research note, he said that stiff competition and a lack of scale relative to Windows-based software platforms meant the company might find it hard to maintain technology leadership and increase market share.Leading retailers slid in spite of an unexpected increase in retail sales in the crucial shopping month of December. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, fell 0.9 per cent to $53.60. Its rival Target slipped 1 per cent to $49.25.US Airways jumped more than 12 per cent to $1.21 after the twice-bankrupt carrier won an extension on a government agreement that will give it enough cash to keep operating through to the end of June.Oil-sensitive stocks were broadly lower as crude futures continued to climb. Maytag, the appliance maker, fell 3.9 per cent to $18.38, while shares in rival Whirlpool dropped 2.1 per cent to $69.38. Ford, the carmaker,fell 1.7 per cent to $14.08.Verizon fell 3 per cent to $37.10 after a profit warning and a series of analyst downgrades.Pharmaceuticals led decliners after Chiron, the biotechnology group, withheld its full-year guiadance because of uncertainties surrounding its Fluvirin flu vaccine. Chiron shares fell 3 per cent to $34.26.Intel slipped 1.5 per cent to $22.82, giving back gains that followed Wednesday's upbeat earnings report. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.3 per cent to 400.57."
144;WHR;Whirlpool Corp;2004-10-22T21:45:40Z;Miserable week for Wall Street bulls;;The second week of the earnings season proved miserable for Wall Street bulls as stocks finished broadly lower in trading that looked like lengthy and painful surgery performed without anaesthetic.By Friday’s close the Dow Jones Industrial Average established a new low for the year as it finished 1.1 per cent lower at 9,757.81. The broader S&P500 index gave up 1 per cent to 1,1095.74. The Nasdaq Composite index eased 2 per cent yesterday to 1,915.14.For the week, the Dow industrials were 1.8 per cent lower while the S&P 500 lost 1.1 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent up for the five-session strectch.Quarterly results dominated the news agenda but to a lesser extent than in previous earnings seasons. As leading names gave a mixed-to-bad picture of profitability and outlook for the future, several other factors provided a vexing background that kept stocks confined in a narrow trading range for much of the time, one they only broke to go lower.Heading a litany of worries was the latest effort by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general, to root out alleged corporate malfeasance. Mr Spitzer a week ago announced a broad probe into the insurance industry’s practices. What began as a lawsuit against leading insurance brokers widened to cover life and health insurance companies as well. As market participants speculated on where Mr Spitzer’s inquiry would reach next, the group of companies targeted came to be known as the Spitzer stocks.By the close on Friday, Marsh & McLennan shares were 72.2 per cent lower since news of the inquiry broke last week. Among the health insurers, Aetna was 17.8 per cent off for the same time period, UnitedHealthcare had lost 3.1 per cent and Cigna gave up 17 per cent.The insurers’ plight came as crude oil prices staged yet another charge upwards after a brief spell of profit-taking as worries mounted over heating oil supplies this winter. Several leading companies reporting results cited rising prices for both oil and other raw materials as a reason for profit declines and tepid guidance going forward.Whirlpool, the home appliance maker, said steel prices undermined its efforts to meet analyst estimates and led it to cut earnings guidance for the year. In the same sector, Maytag warned of the effects of rising costs on its third-quarter earnings but its shares fared better, up 3.6 per cent on Thursday as investors appeared to focus on the success of its turnround efforts.Visteon, the auto parts maker, also cited rising steel prices and customers’ output cuts as it announced a wider loss than expected on Wednesday, sending shares 2.2 per cent lower on Thursday.Some technology stocks caused cheers while others caused jeers.IBM saw its shares add 4 per cent on Tuesday after it gave an upbeat outlook as its revenues grew 9 per cent. Texas Instruments beat analyst estimates as it announced results after the Monday close and saw shares add 6.9 per cent in the subsequent session. Ebay reported a 52 per cent rise in earnings thanks to its international businesses. The news sent shares 6.9 per cent higher on Thursday.However, after the Thursday close Microsoft poured some cold water over bullish hopes for tech as it gave a cautious outlook, sending shares 2.1 per cent lower on Friday.Amazon.com, the internet’s largest retailer, also saw its shares decline, by 10.5 per cent on Friday, after its tepid guidance overshadowed sharp earnings growth.As the earnings season continues, the run-up to the presidential elections appears to be doing nothing to bring investors into the market. As polls show the candidates locked in a dead heat, analysts are saying the stock market - a forward-pricing instrument - had nothing to price and was therefore biding its time.From a technical standpoint, some analysts noted a couple of important levels were being tested. The Dow ended the week-long flirtation with a new low for the year by establishing it yesterday, breaching below 9,800 while the S&P500 broke below 1,100 on Friday and the Nasdaq Composite closed below its 200 day moving average.Several analysts have said that a breach of these benchmarks in either direction was likely to lead to acceleration of the move in subsequent sessions.Given that all three gauges have moved to the downside of their respective technical levels, chart-reading market observers expect an acceleration of the sell-off next week. While many market watchers have expressed the view that markets stand to rally once the presidential elections are over, others doubt that will be the case given concerns about oil, the economy and geopolitics.Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, said the likeliest outcome of the elections is a gridlock betwen the White House and Congress, which has historically been a bullish factor for the stock market.Bullish analysts hope that oil prices will reverse their rise but others have pointed out that such a move could be triggered by a slowdown in economic growth, which would not be a positive for stocks.
