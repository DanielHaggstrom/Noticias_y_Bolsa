With the National Retail Federation calculating that $430bn in industry revenues could evaporate over the next three months, the question is how many of them will reopen.Tens of thousands of retail workers are already being furloughed without pay at Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands, while Macy’s warned its workforce of about 125,000 on Monday that it was unclear when stores could reopen and it would start to furlough most of the staff this week.As companies try to conserve cash, dividend payouts have been postponed at groups, including Nordstrom. At the same time, Best Buy, TJX and Kohl’s are among 126 discretionary consumer companies to draw a total $86bn from credit lines, according to Autonomous Research. Some, such as Mattress Firm, have told landlords that they will fail to make required rent payments for April.Another 30 nationally known US retail companies could file for bankruptcy protection this year, predicted industry consultant Jan Rogers Kniffen. Especially vulnerable are department stores and mall-based clothing chains that have long struggled to stay relevant in the age of Amazon.Retail executives and their advisers are pouring over the details of the congressional rescue bill, which includes $454bn in federal loans available to companies stricken by the crisis.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereBig questions remain about how and when businesses can access the funds and the conditions attached, although Matthew Shay, head of the NRF, said that taken as a whole the package promised a “crucial bridge” for the sector. Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at rating agency Moody’s, added the cash could help investment grade retailers “tide over any temporary liquidity issues”.Long before coronavirus, however, many retailers were battling to keep creditors at bay. Household names including Forever 21 and Pier 1 filed for bankruptcy in recent months and the sector accounted for almost a fifth of US corporate debt that defaulted in the fourth quarter.Junk-rated retailers with large debt burdens, cited by the rating agency Moody’s, include luxury chain Neiman Marcus, with outstanding debt of $6.1bn, mass market department store operator JCPenney ($4.2bn), womenswear company Ascena ($1.8bn) and clothing retailer J Crew ($1.4bn).Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia University and a former chief executive of Sears Canada, doubted federal loans could resuscitate heavily indebted companies. “A business that was struggling going into this crisis and is already leveraged up is unlikely to recover by taking on additional loans” even on favourable terms, he said.Corporate bond markets have become increasingly concerned about how discretionary retailers will cope. A Macy’s bond that matures in 2023, for instance, has tumbled from above $100 at the start of the month to $70, according to Finra data.Macy’s balance sheet has long been in better shape than more distressed rivals, although the department store chain lost its investment grade rating from S&P Global last month and was cut further into junk territory in a spate of sector downgrades last week.The company, which has already suspended its dividend, drawn on a line of credit and stopped capital spending to shore up its finances, said on Monday that “while these actions have helped, it is not enough”, as it drew up the furlough plans.Not everyone is sure coronavirus will lead directly to a wave of retail bankruptcies. “I expect to see an uptick, as companies that were on the edge have greater risk of falling off the edge quicker, but I don’t believe it will be the Armageddon that everyone thinks,” said Perry Mandarino, head of restructuring and co-head of investment banking at B Riley FBR.Such is the scale of the crisis that the bankruptcy process itself is not functioning properly. New York-based Modell’s Sporting Goods has put liquidation sales on hold as customers are unable to visit its stores, and a judge last week granted its request to suspend Chapter 11 proceedings.One leading restructuring banker argued lenders and landlords would do as much as they could to “hit the pause button” for the duration of the crisis. Prof Cohen added it may well be in creditors’ own interests to be more flexible than usual. “The assets that they would seize are currently worth a fraction of what they were before this erupted,” he said. “There will have to be widespread forbearance.”But creditors have bills of their own to pay — as mall owner Taubman pointed out in a memo to tenants, in which it told them it expected rent obligations to be met.Ultimately the longer business remains at a standstill, said Mr Kniffen, the more retailers will fold. “You can draw down on your revolver, you can furlough your employees, you can refuse to pay rent — but if this goes on for a while, you’re going to run out of levers to pull.”And those companies that come through the shutdown bruised, but intact, face the prospect that the impact will be felt long after the virus has been contained, putting them further behind more dominant rivals.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.Restrictions on movement threaten to convert even more consumers both to online shopping — benefiting retailers that have been investing in ecommerce — and to chains that remain open through the crisis such as Walmart, which is taking on 150,000 workers to cope with demand.Amazon — which last week snapped up two store leases from bankrupt New York supermarket Fairway as part of an expanding push into bricks and mortar — is hiring 100,000.John San Marco, research analyst at $356bn asset manager Neuberger Berman, said he was spending much of his time trying to assess how much of the coronavirus disruption would endure. But there was no doubt, he said, that the crisis will lead to “a meaningful acceleration of the retail shake-out”.
1;JWN;Nordstrom;2019-08-21T21:34:54Z;Nordstrom profit beat adds to retail cheer;Luxury chain kept inventory in check and surprised Wall Street despite falling sales;Nordstrom, the upscale US department store chain, cheered investors with a stronger than expected quarterly profit, despite a 5 per cent decline in sales, adding to fresh optimism over the health of the retail industry.The upbeat results came on the heels of blockbuster earnings from industry heavyweights Target and Lowe’s, whose robust sales growth in the second quarter allayed broader fears of a slowdown in the economy and drove shares across the sector sharply higher.Nordstrom was up nearly 6 per cent during the trading day, and following the publication of its results after the bell the stock jumped as much as 16 per cent more.Net sales fell to $3.78bn from $3.98bn in the second quarter that ended August 3, missing a consensus estimate of $3.93bn.But the Seattle-based company managed to boost profits by keeping inventory in check and reducing expenses. Inventory was down 6.5 per cent compared to the second quarter last year.Nordstrom co-president Erik Nordstrom said Wednesday it was “confident in our ability to manage through cycles” and focused on lifting top-line sales, amid softer results across the retail group’s full-price and discount stores.Shares in Nordstrom settled at around 10 per cent higher in after-hours trading, while the new round of good news added more fuel to some other retailers’. Macy’s was up 1.2 per cent and JCPenney was up 3 per cent after hours, for example.Nordstrom booked $141m in net earnings, or 90 cents a share, down from $162m, or 95 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The company easily eclipsed analysts’ average forecast for earnings per share of 75 cents, according to a Refinitiv poll.Nordstrom attributed its sales decline in the quarter to softer performances for its annual Anniversary Sale in July and its off-price business, noting it experienced a challenging start to the period.In full-price retail, Nordstrom’s net sales declined 6.5 per cent. Off-price sales, which include its Nordstrom Rack stores, were down 1.9 per cent.Nordstrom narrowed its full-year guidance for sales and earnings. Net sales are seen falling approximately 2 per cent, versus a prior view of down 2 per cent to flat. Earnings are expected to come in between $3.25 and $3.50 a share, compared with a range of $3.25 to $3.65. Analysts were looking for fiscal 2019 earnings of $3.27 a share.The company said it is still evaluating the fourth tranche of proposed tariffs from the Trump administration, but added the impact of the potential levies on Chinese goods is expected to be “relatively immaterial for the year”.
2;JWN;Nordstrom;2019-05-21T23:18:55Z;Falling sales at big US department stores spark sell-off;Health of US consumer back in focus after Nordstrom, Kohl’s and JC Penney disappoint;New signs of trouble at three of the largest department store chains in the US unnerved investors on Tuesday, reigniting questions about the health of bricks-and-mortar retailers and sending share prices tumbling.Falling quarterly sales were reported by Nordstrom, Kohl’s and JC Penney, which between them operate more than 2,300 stores and employ almost 300,000 people. Kohl’s stock closed down 12 per cent and JC Penney 7 per cent. Nordstrom dropped 9 per cent in trading after the bell.The sector has been closely watched by Wall Street since retail sales fell sharply in December. The dramatic drop during such a critical month for consumer spending led some analysts to fret the US economy was beginning to sputter.Since then, data has swung wildly, rebounding with their biggest jump in 18 months in March only to fall sharply again in April. Economists are also concerned the sector could be hit by the White House’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese goods.Managers at the affected chains insisted the disappointing figures were not due to a sector-wide decline, largely blaming company-specific mis-steps, from marketing problems to floundering loyalty scheme initiatives.After financial markets closed in New York, the upscale Nordstrom chain disclosed a 3.5 per cent decline in net sales from a year ago to $3.4bn. The Seattle-based group warned of a broad-based decline at both its full price and discount businesses, online as well as in stores.There were points in time during the quarter where we just weren’t as competitiveErik Nordstrom, co-president, cited “executional misses”, including a decision to make credits in its loyalty scheme digital-only.The company “later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these [rewards] by mail”, he said, and “as a result, we saw a reduction in traffic”. Net earnings dropped from $87m a year ago to $37m.At mass-market retailer JC Penney, relative strength in fine jewellery and clothing failed to offset declines in women’s accessories and handbags, among other goods. Net losses in its fiscal first quarter widened from $78m last time to $154m, while net sales fell 5.6 per cent to $2.4bn.The latest earnings weakness adds to pressure on the Texas-based chain, which carries $3.8bn in long-term debt and whose market capitalisation has collapsed from highs in 2007 of $18.5bn to just $330m.“Re-establishing the fundamentals of our business operations will take time,” said Jill Soltau, chief executive.The department store results were the latest in a batch of mixed earnings reports from consumer-facing companies. US retailers are being squeezed by falling mall traffic, the rise of online shopping and a shift by consumers towards spending more on recreation and travel.Some chains are producing better results, however. Groceries helped Walmart last week report its strongest first-quarter sales in nine years. Macy’s also eked out a sales improvement, saying that recent bad weather had no impact on sales.TJX, which owns Marshalls and TJ Maxx, announced a 5 per cent rise in like-for-like sales on Tuesday. Results from other retailers, including Target and Best Buy, are scheduled for release in coming days.At Kohl’s, some of the chain’s difficulties appeared to be self-inflicted. Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive, said problems in marketing and homewares had contributed to the slower performance.“Some of our key promotional events weren’t as productive,” she acknowledged, while “there were points in time during the quarter where we just weren’t as competitive” in homewares.Kohl’s executives also said that bad weather, in particular unseasonal cold in the Wisconsin-based company’s Midwest and north-east heartlands, had exacerbated the same-store sales decline in its first quarter, down 3.4 per cent from a year ago.Kohl’s also issued a profit warning for the full year. Adjusted earnings were now expected to come in at between $5.15 and $5.45 a share, down from previous guidance of $5.80 to $6.15. Bruce Besanko, chief financial officer, said pressures included higher trade tariffs, which “we just didn’t have baked into our outlook”.Ms Gass added that Kohl’s, which has a partnership with Amazon to allow customers to return items purchased from the ecommerce giant at its stores, added that Kohl’s had “adjustments under way to get us back on track”.
3;JWN;Nordstrom;2019-01-16T15:25:52Z;Nordstrom shares drop after slow holiday sales;Off-price and digital sales jumped, but traffic was soft at department stores;Nordstrom said slower traffic in its department stores hurt sales during the critical holiday shopping season and warned that full-year earnings will come in around the low end of its guidance.Comparable sales growth of 2.1 per cent year-to-date was in line with its outlook, Nordstrom said, but sales at its full-price department stores fell short of the company’s expectations during the November and December period as shoppers appeared to show a preference for discounts.“As a result, the company has incorporated in its annual expectations higher markdowns taken during holiday and to reposition inventory to a more appropriate level by the end of the year,” the company added in a statement late Tuesday.Shares slipped 6 per cent to $44.43 after falling more than 8 per cent after the opening bell on Wednesday.Nordstrom is one of a few major retailers so far, including Macy’s and Kohl’s, to report disappointing holiday sales despite forecasts for strong consumer spending. MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report tracked more than $850bn in total holiday sales, a 5.1 per cent increase compared to 2017, driven by 19.1 per cent growth in ecommerce.Nordstrom’s comparable sales — a key metric measuring sales at stores open at least 12 months — increased 1.3 per cent year-over-year during the nine weeks ending on January 5. Full-price stores posted just 0.3 per cent growth amid softer traffic. Sales at off-price outlets rose 3.9 per cent.Digital sales, which accounted for 36 per cent of total sales, were up 18 per cent.Nordstrom now expects 2018 earnings near the low end of its prior outlook, which called for a profit of $3.55 to $3.65 a share. Analysts polled by Refinitiv estimated that adjusted earnings would hit $3.58 a share.The company will report full fourth-quarter results on February 28.
4;JWN;Nordstrom;2019-01-03T18:54:23Z;US retail chief Blake Nordstrom dies aged 58;Head of store dynasty was credited with improving group’s merchandising system;Blake Nordstrom, head of the fourth generation of the eponymous 118-year-old retailing dynasty that reasserted family control over the US company, has died. He was 58.Blake passed away unexpectedly in Seattle on Wednesday. Just three weeks ago the father of two wrote in a note to employees that he had been diagnosed with lymphoma, although at the time he said he would undergo chemotherapy and doctors were encouraged by the prognosis.“My heart goes out to the Nordstrom family and everyone at the company during this difficult time,” said Brad Smith, chairman.Kenneth Cole, the fashion designer, described him as “one of our industry’s truest leaders and finest individuals”.Blake was a great-grandson of John Nordstrom, a Swedish immigrant who made a fortune in the Klondike gold rush and invested it all in a Seattle shoe store. Nordstrom expanded beyond the Pacific Northwest to become one of the country’s largest upmarket retailers, and remained under family leadership until the 1990s.Blake worked at the high-end company over four decades. In spite of his bloodline, and in common with longstanding family policy, he started in the company’s lower ranks.After stints in the stockroom, sales and merchandise, the University of Washington economics graduate worked up through management and eventually became president of its Nordstrom Rack division.He took the helm of the group as president in 2000, aged 39, upon the departure of chairman and chief executive John Whitacre. Whitacre had been the first non-family member to hold the positions, and Blake’s elevation was seen by some on Wall Street as a mini family coup. His father Bruce became chairman and headed the board until 2006.Blake was sole president until 2015, although in practice he ran the chain with his brothers, Pete and Erik, who shared in the decision-making. The retailer has left the chief executive title unoccupied.When Blake took over, Nordstrom had been struggling for several years with weak sales and a declining share price. He cut expenses and reduced inventory as part of a revival plan, and was credited with improving the company’s merchandising system.Nordstrom has sought to deal with the pressures of ecommerce by combining its bricks and mortar presence with technology, trying new store and digital concepts. Initiatives include allowing shoppers to tailor a suit on a screen before trying it in the dressing room.Blake also sought to restore the company’s reputation for customer service, permitting consumers to collect items from stores in the early hours of the morning and return items without being quizzed by staff.Nordstrom has not escaped the difficulties in US retail, although it has coped better than rivals that have resorted to big store closures. The company generated $15.1bn in net sales in its 2017 fiscal year. Its market capitalisation stands at $7.99bn.The chain bucked the industry-wide trend for closures by opening its first all-line Manhattan store last year. It plans to follow the men’s store opening with a women’s outlet across the street this year.The business remains under family management, with Pete and Erik at the helm as co-presidents. Family members still own about 30 per cent of the stock.Blake was part of a group that had hoped to take the company private last year, but a special committee for the board rejected the price as inadequate.
5;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-11-15T22:41:05Z;Nordstrom full-price sales cool as customers opt for discount aisle;;Nordstrom on Thursday said full-price sales at the upscale department store cooled in the third quarter as consumers shopped in its bargain aisles, helping the company to better-than-expected revenues but a drop in its gross margin.The Seattle-based company said like-for-like sales rose 2.3 per cent in the third quarter in line with forecasts. However, shoppers eschewed full-price merchandise, instead lapping up discounted items.Comparable sales at its full-price stores rose just 0.4 per cent, down from 4.1 per cent in the second quarter. By comparison, its discount or so-called off-price channels recorded a 5.8 per cent increase in comparable sales, up from 4 per cent the previous quarter.Revenues rose 3.3 per cent from a year ago to $3.75bn, ahead of analysts’ estimate for $3.69bn, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Nordstrom, like other retailers and department stores, has faced a decline in mall traffic amid rising competition from e-commerce competitors like Amazon and off-price rivals like TJX Cos that offer steep discounts.In order to fend off competition Nordstrom, like others in its industry, has expanded its own discount offerings through its Nordstrom Rack brand and invested in its online operations and loyalty program.However, strength in the US economy and upbeat consumer sentiment has helped fuel sales at retailers, with some like Macy’s and Walmart posting solid sales gains.The company, which earlier this year failed in a bid to take the business private, said its third-quarter net income fell to $67m, or 39 cents a share, down from $114m, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The company said it incurred a $72m charge associated with delinquent Nordstrom credit card accounts that were charged higher interest in error.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales slipped 137 basis points to 33.3 per cent.Looking ahead, the company took a slightly rosier view and now expects full-year net sales of between $15.5bn to $15.6bn, up from its previous outlook for $15.4bn to $15.5bn. Nordstrom also nudged higher the lower end of its earnings outlook and now predicts full-year earnings of between $3.55 to $3.65 a share, up from $3.50 to $3.65 a share.Nordstrom shares tumbled 11 per cent in after-hours trade, having ended the day 3.5 per cent lower. The department store chain’s shares are up nearly 25 per cent year-to-date.
6;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-08-17T16:56:59Z;Nordstrom on track for best day in four years;;Nordstrom is roaring towards its biggest one-day gain in more than four years on Friday, after the upscale US department-store chain’s latest quarterly earnings report put it back in fashion on Wall Street.Shares of the Seattle-based company were up 11.55 per cent in midday trading to $58.32, putting them on course for their largest one-day percentage gain since May 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data.The sharp rise comes a day after Nordstrom reported stronger-than-expected earnings. Comparable sales, a key industry metric measuring sales growth, were up 4 per cent year-on-year in the quarter, sailing past expectations for a smaller 0.8 per cent advance, which the company credited to solid growth at both its full-price namesake department stores and its off-price Nordstrom Rack chain.Wall Street was particularly keen on the advances Nordstrom made in expanding digital sales, seen as a key buffer against the pressures exerted on the traditional brick-and-mortar sector by e-commerce giants like Amazon. Digital sales grew 23 per cent year-on-year to comprise 34 per cent of second-quarter sales, up from 29 per cent last year.Its popular anniversary sales attracted “record digital demand”, the company said, hurdling over its previous peak by 80 per cent. On the strength of the current quarter, Nordstrom boosted its earnings and revenue outlook for the full year.The enthusiastic embrace for Nordstrom contrasts with the much cooler reception for rival Macy’s, which dropped nearly 16 per cent earlier this week despite generally solid results.Friday’s gain has taken Nordstrom’s year-to-date gain to 23 per cent, after barely moving in 2017.
7;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-08-16T20:38:31Z;Nordstrom shares shoot higher on strong sales growth;;Nordstrom shares soared on Thursday after the upscale US department-store chain raised its full-year revenue and earnings outlook following stronger-than-expected quarterly sales growth.Nordstrom shares were up 12.8 per cent in after-hours trading, signalling Wall Street’s enthusiasm for its latest quarterly earnings.During the quarter ended August 4, net sales rose 7.1 per cent year-on-year to $3.98bn, while net earnings came in at $162m, versus $110m a year ago. Earnings per diluted share were 95 cents improved on the 65 cents posted in the year-ago period.Analysts had been looking for net sales of $3.95bn and net earnings of $143.57m, or 84 cents a share, per Thomson Reuters.Comparable sales — a key industry metric for sales growth — were up 4 per cent year-on -year in the quarter, sailing well past expectations for a 0.8 per cent advance.The company credited the results to solid performance at both its full-price Nordstrom stores — thanks to strong contributions from kids apparel and beauty categories — and its off-price Nordstrom Rack line. Its digital offerings also continued to gain ground, as it fends off competition from online retailers, with digital sales up 23 per cent from a year ago, representing 34 per cent of overall quarterly sales, a bigger slice than the 29 per cent racked up last year.Crediting its first-half performance, Nordstrom raised its full-year earnings per share outlook. It is now setting its sights on a range of $3.50 to $3.65, up from its previous forecast for $3.35 to $3.55. It also nudged higher its net sales outlook, forecasting a range of $15.4bn to $15.5bn, up from $15.2bn to $15.4bn previously.Nordstrom, like other retailers traditionally reliant on brick-and-mortar stores, has been retrenching in recent years in response to shifting shopping habits. Strong consumer spending during 2018, however, has helped to lift earnings for a broad range of retailers, including Walmart, although rival department-store chain Macy’s latest quarterly report left Wall Street underwhelmed despite generally solid numbers.Earlier this year, its board pulled the plug on discussions with members of its founding family about a potential takeover deal, saying they had not been able to reach an agreement on the right price.After ending 2017 relatively flat, Nordstrom shares are up more than 10 per cent so far this year.
8;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-07-10T17:44:57Z;Nordstrom falls out of fashion as forecasts underwhelm;;Nordstrom shares were relegated to the discount bin on Tuesday after the US department store operator reaffirmed its prior outlook, disappointing those on Wall Street who had been hoping for an upgrade.The stock was down nearly 4.6 per cent in lunchtime trade, putting it on track for its worst one day slide in nearly two months and making it the biggest laggard in the S&P 500.The drop comes as the upmarket retailer reiterated its sales and earnings guidance for the current fiscal year. In a trading update ahead of its investor day, the company said it expects sales to come in at $15.2bn-$15.4bn, compared to the $15.7bn that analysts are forecasting.Same-store sales are predicted to grow between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent while earnings per share is expected to come in the $3.35 to $3.55 range. The market is looking for a 0.8 per cent rise in same-store sales and EPS of $3.46.The update comes as Nordstrom looks to convince investors of its growth prospects after a failed attempt by the Nordstrom family to take the company private earlier this year.Like other US retailers, Nordstrom is facing unprecedented upheaval amid falling mall traffic, shifting shopping patterns that prioritise recreation spending, and fierce competition from online and off-price retailers that offer branded goods at steep discounts.The company, the largest US high-end department chain with 373 stores across 40 states, has sought to adapt with the expansion of its own discount chain Nordstrom Rack, which sells branded clothing at reduced prices. The chain has been a bright spot, helping to attract bargain hunters and driving a 0.8 per cent rise in same-store sales at the company last year.Nordstrom plans to outline its strategy to become “the best fashion retailer in a digital world” at its investor day on Tuesday. It said in its trading update that it is aiming for sales to grow by an average of 3-4 per cent every year until 2022.
9;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-05-17T21:01:01Z;Nordstrom sales growth disappoints despite decent earnings;;Solid revenue and profit growth was not enough to save department store Nordstrom from getting marked down after its sales growth fell short of analysts’ target.Shares of the upscale US department store chain dropped 6 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday following its quarterly report for the three months to May 5.During that time, net sales grew 5.8 per cent from a year ago to $3.47bn, thanks in part to a boost from an event for members of its Nordstrom Rewards programme.Net earnings rose to $87m, or 51 cents per diluted share, from $63m a year ago, or 37 cents. Its gross profit dropped 21 basis points from a year earlier to 34.1 per cent of net sales, which Nordstrom credited to higher occupancy expenses related to openings of its off-price Rack stores in the US and Canada, as well as pre-launch expenses for its Nordstrom Men’s store in New York City.Analysts had been looking for sales of $3.45bn and net income of $72m, or 43 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters data.While the headline numbers came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, comparable sales — a key industry metric measuring sales growth — came in at just 0.6 per cent for the overall company. For its full-price stores and websites, comparable sales were up 0.7 per cent, while its off-price lines, including Nordstrom Rack, registered just an 0.4 per cent increase.The comparable sales trends are a reversal from a year ago, when the metric for the entire company and full-price stores was in decline, while the off-price line rang up 2.3 per cent growth.Nordstrom, like other department stores, is facing a fierce competition as more shoppers flock online rather than to brick-and-mortar stores. Its off-price lines, however, had been a recent bright spot, as it helped attract bargain hunters.Two of its department store rivals — Macy’s and Dillard’s — had set the bar high by reporting better than expected results earlier this week.Nordstrom’s founding family recently explored a potential takeover deal, but the company’s board announced in March that it had ended discussions since they had been unable to reach an agreement on the right price.After falling 1.15 per cent last year, Nordstrom shares are up about 7.5 per cent so far in 2018.

Kohl’s shares declined 1.6 per cent to $60.39, and JC Penney shares were off by about 1.9 per cent to $2.83.The bear camp on Macy’s swelled after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the stock to “underweight” from “equal weight” and lowered the price target to $25, from $27, citing the company’s “ongoing negative store comps and continued decline in return on invested capital (ROIC)”. That left Macy’s with 5 “buy” ratings, 11 “hold” ratings and 3 “sell” ratings on Wall Street.Kimberly Greenberger, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said Macy’s ROIC declined sharply from 2014 through the third quarter of last year. However, Macy’s shares have jumped 61 per cent since then, on the back of its real estate sales and the US tax reform.“However, we expect ROIC to deteriorate in 2018 after 1Q and thus expect the stock price to decline once again,” Ms Greenberger, said. “Furthermore, Macy’s increased reliance on private label credit card income and real estate gains masks the underlying deterioration in core retail EBIT.”More broadly, Ms Greenberger blamed “secular headwinds such as ecommerce disintermediation, market share loss, ecommerce EBIT margin pressure, and apparel price deflation” as reasons for remaining cautious on the broader department store sector.US department stores have struggled amid falling mall traffic and rising competition from e-commerce retailers. The companies that overbuilt during the boom times have been shuttering stores and investing in their online operations as they work to lure consumers back.Macy’s unofficially kicks off earnings season for department stores when it delivers its quarterly update on Wednesday.
12;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-03-21T18:38:33Z;Nordstrom: not like Mike;Management buyouts require telling one story to shareholders, another to backers;See what thou hath wrought, Michael Dell? The computing pioneer inspired would-be buyout teams by engineering a complex $25bn purchase of his eponymous tech company five years ago. He rationalised that the software and PC markets were going through so much change that he could only restructure Dell outside the public market.The family behind the luxury department store chain Nordstrom has recently spent months trying to pull off the same trick. The board terminated discussions on Tuesday with the family over disagreements on an acceptable buyout price, unable to find the point where shareholders are persuaded to throw in the towel but where private equity and banks can buy their vision.*Nordstrom might at least have partial protection from the carnage in American retail. A quarter of its sales are already online. Its stores are in better shopping malls. Even so, its share price last autumn, before the family’s public interest in a deal, was half that of its level as recently as 2015.The family’s recent bid for the company at $50 per share, a modest 24 per cent premium, implied an enterprise vale of roughly $10bn. It had arranged for up to $2bn of private equity and $7.5bn of debt. Big buyouts, however, can hinge on the amount of equity the family contributes. The Nordstroms were willing to put up 80 per cent of their $2.5bn stake, cashing out only $500m. After that $50 a share offer was rejected, the family bowed out on Tuesday. Whatever special insight they had into the business was not enough to convince funders to go higher. At the same time, shareholders liked Nordstrom’s prospects enough to reject a premium bid.The consensus is that Mr Dell, buying at a cyclical trough, got the best of minority shareholders. By selling some shares and keeping the rest, the Nordstrom family wanted the best of both worlds. Shareholders noticed and were appropriately unappreciative.* This has been amended from the original article to reflect that it was the board that terminated deal discussions.
13;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-03-20T22:21:12Z;Nordstrom says takeover talks with founding family are over;;"Nordstrom’s board is ending discussions with members of its founding family about a potential takeover deal, saying that they had not been able to reach an agreement on the right price for the upscale US department store chain.Nordstrom shares fell nearly 5 per cent in after-hours trading following the announcement, which comes just weeks after the company said that an offer from a group comprising members of the Nordstrom family — including co-presidents Blake, Peter and Erik Nordstrom and chairman emeritus Bruce Nordstrom — had undervalued it.A special committee formed by the board to evaluate the offer said in a statement on Tuesday evening:The Special Committee believes that Nordstrom is well positioned to capitalise on future opportunities to gain market share through its customer strategy, centred on three strategic pillars: providing a differentiated product offering; delivering exceptional services and experiences; and leveraging the strength of its brand. Nordstrom continues to integrate its digital and physical assets to deliver best-in-class capabilities across supply chain, technology, marketing, product and services to better serve customers on their terms.The company is uniquely positioned in the industry and has generated market share gains and industry leading e-commerce penetration fuelled by investments in digital capabilities to expand customer reach and engagement. The Special Committee is confident that the company’s ability to leverage its digital capabilities and its local market assets of people, product, and place will support growth across both its full-price and off-price businesses.The family group had previously offered $50 a share for the shares it did not already own, valuing the retailer at just under $10bn when including its net debt.Like other US department stores, Nordstrom has been working to adapt to an era in which shoppers increasingly choose ecommerce over brick-and-mortar stores. It has been working to enhance its digital offerings and made steady gains in the burgeoning off-price retail sector with its Nordstrom Rack stores."

Shares in Nordstrom fell nearly 3 per cent in after-hours trading to $50.52.“The special committee has reviewed the group’s indicative acquisition proposal, in consultation with its financial adviser and legal counsel, and has determined that the price proposed is inadequate,” the company said in a statement.
15;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-03-01T21:42:22Z;Nordstrom holiday sales grow as it explores take-private deal;;Nordstrom reported better than expected sales during the critical holiday shopping season, even as its founding family discusses a possible transaction to take the US luxury department-store chain private.The company said on Thursday that sales for the quarter ending February 3 were up 8.4 per cent from a year ago to $4.6bn, in line with analysts’ estimates. Net earnings of $151m were down from the $201m racked up during the year-ago period, thanks in part to a $42m charge related to US tax reform.Earnings per diluted share of 89 cents, reflecting a 25 cent charge related to the tax provision, were less than the $1.24 that analysts had expected.Comparable sales, a key industry metric, rose 2.6 per cent during the quarter, which encompassed the holiday shopping season. That trumped analysts’ expectations for an advance of just 1 per cent. That reflect a 2.4 per cent gain for comparable sales among its full-line Nordstrom stores, as well as Nordstrom.com, and a 3.7 per cent increase for its off-price Nordstrom Rack brand, reflecting the increasing popularity of these discount-focused stores.The company said it expect net sales of $15.2bn-$15.4bn in fiscal year 2018, just a hair over the $15.1bn in net sales recorded for FY 2017 and comparable sales growth of 0.5 to 1.5 per cent.Nordstrom shares, which fell just over 1 per cent in 2017, are up about 6 per cent so far this year.The founding Nordstrom family has been pursuing talks about a possible transaction to take the company private once more, as it tries to position itself to compete in a fast-evolving retail landscape. The company said on Thursday that it does not plan to make any further share repurchases while the talks are ongoing. About $414m in authorisations remain.Its shares were down more than 4 per cent in after-hours trading.
16;JWN;Nordstrom;2018-01-09T22:06:43Z;Holiday sales growth helps brighten Nordstrom’s profit forecast;;US luxury department-store chain Nordstrom is marking up the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast range after an upswing in sales during the all-important holiday shopping season.The company said on Tuesday afternoon that net sales rose 2.5 per cent in the nine weeks ending December 30, compared to the same period a year earlier. Comparable sales, a key industry metric, grew 1.2 per cent year-over-year.The biggest boost came from Nordstrom Rack, the company’s off-price brand, and its “Haute Look” members-only bargain site, which together saw net sales advance 8.2 per cent, and comparable sales increase 2.9 per cent.By contrast, sales from full-line Nordstrom stores — including Nordstrom.com — were up 0.7 per cent, with comparable sales advancing 1 per cent.Following the holiday results, Nordstrom said it is now looking for net sales to grow 4.2 per cent this year, including an 0.5 per cent increase in comparable sales. It has boosted thebottom line of its earnings-per-share forecast from a range of $2.85-$2.95 to $2.90-$2.95.“This reflects sales performance near the high end of the Company’s outlook range, continued stability in merchandise margins and expected deleverage from higher supply chain, technology, and occupancy expenses associated with Nordstrom’s growth initiatives,” the company said in a release.Nordstrom’s full-year and fourth-quarter financial results are due out March 1.Shares of the company had taken a hit last October after the company shelved plans to take itself private in 2017. It had said that it would restart the process after the holiday shopping season was over.Nordstrom shares were down 1.34 per cent in after-hours trading.
17;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-11-19T16:27:44Z;Investors bet against happy holidays for retailers;Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s are among the most heavily shorted retail stocks in the US;Investors have sharply increased their bets against the US retail sector ahead of the holiday shopping season, anticipating that shoppers will continue their migration to the internet from the local mall.So-called short interest in US retail stocks — the proportion of a company’s shares on loan to short sellers who are betting they will fall in value — has reached the highest level in at least two years, after jumping 17 per cent in the past month, according to IHS Markit.The holiday shopping season kicks off in earnest in the US this week, with the traditional “Black Friday” sales that draw shoppers after the Thanksgiving Day holiday.Macy’s, the department store chain, is among the most shorted retailers with short interest topping 17 per cent of the underlying shares, an increase of more than 40 per cent over the past month. Short interest for rival Nordstrom was 12 per cent, Kohl’s 11 per cent while Target topped 6 per cent.Across all of the S&P 500’s retail constituents, 5.6 per cent of shares outstanding were on loan to short sellers at the end of last week. By contrast, short interest for the benchmark S&P 500 index was 2.7 per cent.“This is one of the easier trades you put on around the holidays,” says Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, an investment newsletter. “You short retail before the holidays because invariably the reality never lives up to the hype.”He added that this year “it does seem like investors and traders are shorting retail because they feel Amazon and other online retailers will have a great year and take more share away from brick and mortar retail”.Short interest in Amazon amounted to just 0.14 per cent of its float.While analysts are forecasting record Black Friday sales, the holiday season caps off a torrid year for retailers.Department stores, the anchors of American shopping malls, have been particularly brutalised by the shift towards ecommerce. Macy’s this month reported same-store sales shrunk for the 11th straight quarter. Nordstrom last month abandoned plans to go private after financing dried up. Kohl’s in the third quarter squeezed out its first sales rise in nearly two years: of 0.1 per cent.“No one has yet proven that they can withstand the Amazon onslaught, particularly over Black Friday,” says Joel Bines, director at AlixPartners, a consultancy. Some retailers are slashing prices to try to maintain market share as fewer people walk into malls to shop, but this strategy eats into margins.Still, short selling can be a risky strategy for investors, as even modestly positive surprises in performance can prompt a big share price jump. In a “short squeeze”, short sellers are forced to buy stock to cover their positions, accelerating the upward move and exacerbating their losses.Last Friday, for example, Abercrombie & Fitch and Foot Locker jumped more than 20 per cent in a matter of minutes.”Retailers have done a very good job of lowering expectations dramatically,” says Mr Bines. “Even the slightest beat can result in a giant increase in market value on a percentage basis.”
18;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-11-10T15:14:04Z;Winners and losers emerge in US department store war;Retailers reveal diverging fortunes as they clear inventory for holiday season;A flurry of earnings results revealed diverging fortunes of US department stores as they tried to clear inventory ahead of the critical holiday shopping season.In the three months to October, which includes the back-to-school season, Macy’s lost 4 per cent of comparable sales, marking nearly three years of quarterly declines, while Nordstrom reported comparable sales fell 0.9 per cent, a steeper drop than Wall Street had expected.But striking a brighter note was Kohl’s, which squeezed out its first sales rise in nearly two years, and JC Penney, which reported sales double that of consensus forecasts. It has been a punishing year for US department stores, with investors broadly selling the stocks of the stores that typically anchor malls, as more people shop online. The department store sub-index of the S&P 500 has fallen by nearly a third this year, while Credit Suisse estimates more than 140m sq ft of retail will be shut this year. The tough trading environment forced JC Penney to issue a surprise profit warning last month, while Nordstrom suspended its efforts to go private after financing dried up in the wake of Toys R Us’ unexpected bankruptcy.Investors appeared poised to pick winners from losers based on the latest income statements, however. Macy’s stock was up 2.9 per cent in afternoon trade on Friday, despite its sales loss, as the company also maintained its guidance for the year. JCPenney surged more than 14 per cent. Kohl’s stock was 3.7 per cent higher, while shares in Nordstrom slid 1.7 per cent.JC Penney chief Marvin Ellison said the better sales proved its aggressive discounting was “the right decision” even as it hit profits in the quarter. The company has been slashing prices to get rid of leftover clothes, particularly in its women’s section, “allowing for an improved apparel assortment heading into the holiday season”, he said. Moody’s commended Kohl’s and Macy’s for controlling inventory tightly, a strategy that comes “in stark contrast” to JC Penney’s liquidation sales. The idea is to restrict inventory to avoid resorting to steep discounts for unsold items left on the rack, to “adapt to the changing competitive environment”, said Christina Boni, Moody’s vice-president.JC Penney has endured the steepest losses of the group this year, losing two-thirds of its value as it shut stores and revised down guidance. However, big sales helped increase like-for-like sales by 1.7 per cent, lifting its stock even as it revealed a loss of 41 cents a share in the quarter. The results were muddied by the impact from the severe hurricanes that ravaged Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, with all four of the department store chains claiming the storms had hurt sales in the quarter. Nordstrom and Macy’s said the hurricanes wiped $20m from sales, while Kohl’s estimated a $15m hit. The chief executives of Macy’s and Kohl’s also blamed soft sales on unusually warm weather, curbing shoppers’ appetites for winter jackets and boots.
19;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-11-09T21:48:24Z;Nordstrom shares slip as key sales figure falls more than expected;;Nordstrom shares fell in extended trading after the department store chain said on Thursday that comparable sales fell more than expected in the third quarter, even as earnings topped analysts’ estimates.Shares in the Seattle-based chain fell 4 per cent after hours to $38.50 after it said comparable sales — a measure of sales in stores open at least 12 months — fell 0.9 per cent, steeper than expectations for a 0.3 per cent slide, according to data provider FactSet.The department-store chain — which scrapped plans to take itself private this year following reports that banks were wary of providing financing for the deal — said net sales rose 2 per cent to $3.5bn compared to analysts’ expectations of $3.58bn. Total revenues climbed 2.5 per cent to $3.6bn.The company swung to a profit of $114m, or 67 cents a share, compared with a loss of $10m, or 6 cents a share, in the year-ago period. That eclipsed analysts’ estimates for earnings of 64 cents.Nordstrom said a string of hurricanes that battered Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas shaved about 4 cents off its earnings. Its previous year’s figures were impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $197m.At 34.7 per cent, tetail gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 12 basis points compared with the year-ago period.Nordstrom’s results follow mixed quarterly updates from Macy’s and Kohl’s earlier on Thursday. Department stores are struggling to revive sales at a time when rising online competition, a fall in mall traffic, and consumers’ preference for spending on “experiences” rather than things are dampening their business. Moreover, department stores, which bulked up during boom times, are also working to right-size their store fleet and inventory and to cut costs.Looking ahead, the company continues to expect net sales to rise about 4 per cent and for comparable sales to remain flat. However, it did lower the high-end of its earnings outlook to a range of between $2.85 to $2.95 a share, from $2.85 to $3.00 a share previously.Nordstrom shares are down nearly 17 per cent so far this year.
20;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-10-16T15:52:50Z;Nordstrom slides after move to go private is put on hold;Family behind US department store group postpones deal until next year;US department store chain Nordstrom has scrapped plans to take itself private this year, just weeks after reports that banks were wary of providing financing for the deal.The 116-year-old chain on Monday said it plans to restart the process of going private after the all-important holiday shopping season. It added that a special committee formed to oversee a sale was “prepared to thoroughly evaluate such a proposal from the group at that time, if one is made”. The company, co-founded by Swedish immigrant John W Nordstrom with money made in the Alaskan gold rush, stunned Wall Street in June when it said members of the Nordstrom family were considering a buyout as they look to navigate the industry-wide slowdown in sales. Family members own roughly 30 per cent of the group.Shares had initially jumped on expectations that Nordstrom was going private after nearly 40 years as a public company. However, those gains receded in recent weeks following reports that the family was struggling to secure the financing needed for the deal. The abrupt bankruptcy of Toys R Us, following others including Payless Shoes and Gymboree in recent months, also put lenders on edge. On Monday Nordstrom shares fell more than 6 per cent, pushing them to sit 15 per cent lower this year, on the news the family had put the brakes on a deal. Highlights of the FT’s coverage of how online shopping is disrupting the US retail sectorFounded in 1901 as a single shoe shop in Seattle, Nordstrom grew into a traditional anchor in American shopping malls. The company has fared better than peers, but has still been bruised as changing shopping habits and a glut of mall space has ravaged traditional US retailers in the past year. The largest US high-end department chain, with 360 stores that span 40 states and Canada, has sought to adapt with the expansion of its own discount chain Nordstrom Rack, which sells branded clothing at reduced prices. Nordstrom last month unveiled plans to open its first store without inventory, serving instead as a hub for customers to talk to a stylist or pick up their online purchases. According to the New York Post, the Nordstrom family has been in talks with private equity group Leonard Green, which was reportedly interested in providing $1bn to fund the deal. However, the firm’s participation was contingent on bank financing being arranged, given that a buyout could cost as much as $10bn. Any buyout deal would require the family to acquire the rest of Nordstrom’s outstanding shares. Nordstrom on Monday said it would “remain focused on running the business”.

According to the NY Post, the PE firm’s participation was contingent on bank financing getting arranged given that a buyout could cost as much as $10bn.Shares in Nordstrom, which had advanced by as much 24 per cent since June, were trading 7.2 per cent lower at $43,75, giving it a market value of $7.28bn.Any buyout deal would require the family to acquire 100 per cent of Nordstrom’s outstanding shares.
22;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-09-13T20:57:20Z;Traditional retailers outperform Amazon this month;Turnround after tough year for sector as S&P 500 moves to fresh high;Shares of retailers are on track for the best month in more than a year as investors return to a sector that has been cast into the bargain bin on fears that traditional bricks-and-mortar stores are destined to disappear.Experts have long been warning that online shopping would ultimately replace physical stores but concern over this trend accelerated this year with the stock of ecommerce behemoth Amazon surpassing $1,000 while shares tied to traditional retailers sold off.In September so far, however, the retailing sector of the S&P 500 has climbed 4 per cent — the best month since July 2016.“The greatest percentage of earnings per share beats and upward revisions in years triggered positive headlines and upgrades of several left-for-dead retail stocks,” analysts at Nomura Instinet wrote in a report this month, adding that “yet, despite the positives, [the second quarter] saw the worst EPS growth in years”.Shares of Macy’s are up 9.1 per cent so far this month, having lost 42 per cent from the start of the year through to the end of August.Amazon, which is also in the index, was lagging with a gain of 1.9 per cent in September, but it rose by about a third in the first eight months of this year.At the close in New York, Nordstrom had rallied 6 per cent to $47.74 on a report that its founding family was nearing a deal with Leonard Green, the private equity firm, to take the company private.Shares in the department store were down about 7 per cent from the start of the year through to the end of August.The broader US equity market was marginally higher on the day, with the S&P 500 ending at a record high.The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,498.37 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 22,158.18, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.1 per cent to 6,460.19.The gains by retailing shares has accompanied a drop in the cost to insure against their defaults, despite the issues that the industry still confronts.The cost to protect against a default by Macy’s slid to its lowest level since March on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg data. The cost to buy credit default swaps that insures investors in case of a default by Kohl’s hit its lowest level of the year while Gap CDS costs fell to near two-year lows.In spite of the price moves in September, the overall outlook for traditional retail remains bleak. Fitch Ratings on Wednesday warned about the potential fallout for credit in the event of a US retail “shock scenario”.“A hypothetical rapid rise in Amazon’s US apparel market share could have significant credit implications for existing retailers, [real estate investment trusts] and [commercial mortgage-backed securities] transactions,” the rating agency said.“Sharp declines in retailer revenue and margins and accelerated store closings would likely drive significant cash flow erosion and weaken credit profiles for apparel-focused retailers, mall Reits and retail-heavy CMBS deals in such a scenario.”Additional reporting by Eric Platt in New York

CNBC had reported that the founding Nordstrom family “is leaning towards a partnership” with private-equity firm Leonard Green, which would provide roughly $1bn in equity to help fund the deal.Nordstrom announced in June that members of its founding family had formed a group to study the possibility of taking the Seattle-based business private after more than 39 years as a public company, as they look to navigate the industry-wide slowdown in retail.
24;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-09-11T17:40:32Z;Nordstrom shares drop after it announces inventory-less store;;Wall Street isn’t lining up for Nordstrom’s latest retail foray — a store without inventory.The company’s shares fell more than 4 per cent on Monday after the US department store chain announced plans to launch its first “Nordstrom Local” store in West Hollywood next month.The move comes as retailers — and especially department stores, a traditional anchor of shopping malls — look to retrench to counteract declining customer foot traffic and online competition. Some companies, like Sears and Target, are exploring smaller-format stores to try to lure back shoppers.Nordstrom said on Monday that its Nordstrom Local will have a 3,000 square-foot footprint, compared to its average 140,000-square foot full store. Instead of dedicated inventory, the store will have just one “styling suite” and eight dressing rooms, where shoppers are meant to interact with “personal stylists” who can bring merchandise in for them to peruse. The store will also complement Nordstrom’s online offerings, serving as a hub for customers to pick up their digital purchases or have them altered or tailored.Shea Johnson, Nordstrom’s senior vice-president of customer experience, said in a statement:As the retail landscape continues to transform at an unprecedented pace, the one thing we know that remains constant is that customers continue to value great service, speed and convenience. We know there are more and more demands on a customer’s time and we wanted to offer our best services in a convenient location to meet their shopping needs.In recent quarters, Nordstrom has been seen as better positioned to weather broad retail challenges than department-store rivals like Macy’s, thanks in part to growing online sales and growth for its Nordstrom Rack discount-focused stores.Nevertheless, the sector’s headwinds prompted members of the founding Nordstrom family to form a group to explore the possibility of taking the company private.Year-to-date, Nordstrom shares are down almost 8 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data. By midday trading, it was on track for its worst one-day fall since last month at 4.3 per cent.

US department stores fight between themselves instead.The sector has been brutalised by the shift towards e-commerce. Sector earnings this week revealed a modest stabilisation at stalwarts, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Kohl’s that proved all-too fragile.On Friday, JC Penney said that heavy discounting had pushed it into a wider loss than expected. Shares in the company crashed by nearly a fifth.As department stores execute a painful retreat, the price wars they engage in to maintain market share resemble passengers on a sinking ship fighting over life vests.Macy’s said this week that it was comfortable with its full-year forecast of like-for-like sales down by 2-3 per cent.On this basis, earnings per share would fall by as much as nearly a tenth. It is furiously shutting down or monetising unproductive stores.But even after presenting a set of reassuring results, its shares have lost more than 10 per cent in the past week and have almost halved in the past year. This is the same sort of treatment meted out to Penney’s, whose prospects are far more dim.Each store faces pressure to keep fighting. In retail, that means cutting prices. Macy’s boss Jeff Gennette said: “We expect the fourth quarter to be very promotional. And it is — and we’re going to have all of our firepower ready to go for that.”Sears and JC Penney are cutting prices to keep their heads above water. Macy’s and other ostensible survivors have to cut prices, too.Hudson’s Bay, the owner of the Saks and Lord & Taylor chains, has an activist advising it to abandon retail and sell its flagship property. The Dillards chain is getting similar advice.The natural reaction would be for groups to combine. But complicated liabilities and integration constrain that.

26;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-08-10T20:37:23Z;Nordstrom bucks the department-store slump with upbeat earnings;;A better-than-expected showing at its annual “anniversary sale”, growing online sales and improving merchandise margins have helped Nordstrom beat the broader department-store slump and post stronger profits and sales growth than analysts had expected.On Thursday, Nordstrom said that second-quarter net sales rose 3.5 per cent year-over-year to $3.71bn, just a hair shy of the $3.75bn that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected. Comparable sales, a key industry metric, rose 1.7 per cent during the quarter, beating forecasts for an 0.4 per cent decline.Of that, comparable sales at Nordstrom-brand stores and online grew 1.4 per cent — led by women’s apparel and beauty divisions — while comparable sales at its discount-driven Nordstrom Rack increased 3.1 per cent.Net earnings came in at $110m, beating predictions for $108.2m, and earnings per diluted share were 65 cents, better than the 63.5 cents that Wall Street was looking for.The company credited its sales growth with an anniversary sale that “performed better than recent trends” as well “improved merchandise margins, reflecting the continued strength in regular price selling.” Online sales growth from Nordstrom.com also reached 20 per cent during the quarter, the company said.The solid second quarter performance prompted Nordstrom to boost the bottom end of its full-year forecasts. It is now looking for net sales to grow about 4 per cent, compared to a previous range of 3-4 per cent and earnings per diluted share of $2.85 to $3.00, versus previous forecasts for $2.75-$3.00.The results come after a grim day of earnings for fellow big US department-store chains Macy’s, Kohl’s and Dillard’s. While sales declines at the three retailers were not as steep as feared, news of falling profit margins was enough to trigger a fresh sell-off.The declining fortunes of department stores have recently prompted members of the founding Nordstrom family to form a group to study the possibility of taking the Seattle-based business private after more than 39 years as a public company.Nordstrom shares, which are down 6.7 per cent year to date, rose 1.8 per cent in after-hours trading after falling 4.3 per cent during the trading session.
27;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-06-09T04:01:59Z;Dealmakers flock to a retail industry in flux;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;The bloodbath among US department stores has quickly grabbed the attention of Wall Street dealmakers.On Thursday, Seattle-based Nordstrom said it would examine a go-private deal led by the Nordstrom family. The family owns about a third of the company (and three Nordstroms are co-presidents in lieu of a single chief executive).A deal would likely be valued at about $10bn. But, as Lex noted on Thursday, the family could buy out public shareholders without relying on a private equity infusion.This would require nearly $6bn of new debt. But overall leverage would still be below 5x ebitda, so an aggressive bank could make that number work. Centerview and Sidley Austin are working with the independent directors who will negotiate with the Nordstrom family, who are being represented by Moelis, on a deal.Financial engineers are hard at work across the department store industry. Neiman Marcus has been reported to be the target of Hudson’s Bay — which just announced 2,000 job cuts — the owner of Saks. But Neiman needs a debt restructuring, which apparently has slowed the merger talks.Meanwhile, industry stalwart Macy’s has some interesting choices to make. Its shares are down 70 per cent in the past two years. But with much of its real estate owned, it has a series of options on how to monetise its property. And no shortage of private equity and hedge funds are willing to help it figure out what to do.Retail M&A has reached its highest level since 2007, according to a May Dealogic report. That’s no surprise — there are few things dealmakers like more than an industry in flux.Welcome to the FT’s curated briefing on deals and dealmaking.

Due.Diligence@FT.comDonald Trump is bad for deals. Dealogic data show that so far this year M&A activity in the US is down 11 per cent compared with a year ago as a barrage of scandals inside the White House sparks uncertainty over the prospect of tax reform, forcing chief executives to put deals on ice. John Purcell, a veteran banker at JPMorgan Chase, said that Trump has had a “chilling effect on deal activity”. Speaking at a conference held by S&P Global Ratings in New York, he added: “Personally, I’ve had three M&A deals die since Trump was elected.”The opposite is true in Europe (as the chart above shows), where overall M&A activity is up more than 25 per cent so far compared with the same period last year. Some bankers told DD that the recent victory of Emmanuel Macron in France’s presidential election, as well as the defeat of far-right parties in the Dutch polls, had helped lift European business confidence.The deal bonanza in Europe was driven by a jump in activity in France and Italy. The chart below shows the bump nicely (particularly in Italy). Dealmakers insist that the appetite for deals in the US remains robust. The problem, they say, is the uncertainty and confusion created by the administration. If Trump manages to clear the clouds over his administration, we might just witness a boom in deals. But that’s a big if (see James Comey’s gripping testimony on Thursday). They say there’s no such thing as bad assets, just bad prices. It’s a motto toxic debt investors in China must be taking to heart as they take on some of the trickiest deals in the region. Global investors might be catching on to that idea too. ShoreVest, a distressed debt investor based in southern China, told the Financial Times that it is raising a $750m fund for buying bad debt portfolios in China, drawing in interest from sovereign wealth and pension funds. Over the past few months, major investors such as Bain Capital, Lone Star and Hong Kong’s PAG have also moved into the market.Bad debt deals in China are not for the faint of heart. Even experienced distressed-debt hands have steered clear of the market in recent years.China is in the throes of a bad debt epidemic — up to $3tn in the market now — and many of those assets will never be recoverable. The courts in China can make things more difficult. Many companies desperately need restructuring or liquidation but local courts often choose to keep zombie groups alive if it keeps people working.That leaves bad debt dealmakers with a surplus of risky opportunities. Only after years of experience do investors figure out where they can ultimately squeeze returns out of the unsavoury debt loads. The secret is pricing in hidden risks such as government interference in deals, and often paying pennies on the dollar for the murkiest loans.ShoreVest’s fundraising and the new entrants into the China distressed market indicate that investors are becoming more confident with dealmakers’ ability to pull it off.Paul Singer’s hedge fund Elliott has recruited Paul Best, a Warburg Pincus managing director, as it looks to expand into European private equity, the WSJ reports. It added that Best started this week in London and will report to Singer’s son Gordon, who runs the Europe office.Deutsche Bank has hired Nick Richitt as a managing director in its healthcare investment banking team. Richitt, who joins from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, will focus on healthcare IT and outsourcing.Matthew Zames, the chief operating officer at JPMorgan who was seen as a potential successor to chief executive Jamie Dimon, is leaving the bank, the FT reported.Andrew Hede and Adam Chepenik are joining the US restructuring advisory practice at EY.

28;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-06-08T18:47:38Z;Nordstrom: Ivanka be alone;Possibility that department store will go private signals bottom of retail market;The three members of the Nordstrom family who collectively run the eponymous US luxury department chain are driven by economics rather than sentiment.A shareholder recently asked why the retailer dropped Ivanka Trump’s clothing line. Co-president Peter Nordstrom calmly explained that the first daughter’s assortment “performed very, very poorly for us in the last year”.The Nordstroms are more bullish on their business’ broader prospects. The family, which owns a third of the Seattle-based company, is considering buying out the listed group. For the battered department store sector, the move signals the bottom of the market.Assuming a 25 per cent premium to Nordstrom’s closing price on Wednesday, the enterprise value would be $10.5bn. This values the company at a modest six times earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.Nordstrom would then need to come up with just under $6bn in debt to buy out public shareholders. With $2bn of borrowings outstanding, the ratio of debt to earnings before such deductions as interest and tax would rise to just under five times.Raising only debt finance at that level, without private equity, would be a huge vote of confidence in the Nordstrom business. The family has not mentioned any buyout group waiting in the wings to finance the bid.The shares have fallen 50 per cent since peaking in 2015. But it has been a leader in adapting to the trends in retail.A quarter of its sales are online and it has acquired upstart e-commerce concepts like Trunk Club and HauteLook. Nearly a third of sales come from its discount format, Rack. Still, the diminution of its core, high-touch department store experience is real. Nordstrom’s operating margin has halved in the past four years.Recalling the ruthlessness with which Nordstrom ditched Ivanka, independent shareholders should fear the same fate. The family knows the company’s prospects best and its offer looks opportunistic. The price should not be opportunistically cheap, too.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
29;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-06-08T16:02:32Z;Nordstrom family considers taking department store private;Group to study options as industry faces sales slowdown;"After more than 39 years as a public company, Nordstrom, the venerable US department store chain that started life as a single shoe shop more than 110 years ago, could well become private again.The upmarket retailer said on Thursday that members of the founding Nordstrom family have formed a group to study the possibility of taking the Seattle-based business private as they look to navigate the industry-wide slowdown in sales.The group — whose members collectively hold more than a third of Nordstrom stocks, according to Bloomberg data — has not made any formal proposals yet.Any deal would require the family to acquire 100 per cent of Nordstrom’s outstanding shares, however, and Nordstrom cautioned that there was no guarantee that an offer would be made or accepted by the company.Still, the prospect of a buyout sent shares in Nordstrom up by as much as 18 per cent, to give the company a market value of nearly $8bn.Before Thursday, the stock had shed more than 15 per cent of its value since the start of the year as it struggled to weather the malaise that has engulfed the wider US retail sector.Retailers are facing unprecedented upheaval amid falling mall traffic, shifting shopping patterns that prioritise recreation spending, and fierce competition from online and off-price retailers that offer branded goods at steep discounts.While Nordstrom, which was co-founded by Swedish immigrant John W Nordstrom with money made from the Alaskan Gold Rush, has arguably fared better than many of its mid-market rivals such as Macy’s and Sears, it has not been completely immune.The company, the largest US high-end department chain with 354 stores across 40 states, has sought to adapt with the expansion of its own discount chain Nordstrom Rack, which sells branded clothing at reduced prices.Still, same-store sales, a key industry metric, have fallen in four out of the past five quarters and shares tumbled by nearly a fifth over a two-day period last month following a particularly disappointing set of first-quarter results.A move to take Nordstrom private could potentially give the company space to rethink its long-term strategy without having to worry about short-term share price movements.The family members that are exploring the buyout include co-presidents Blake, Peter and Erik Nordstrom; president of stores James Nordstrom; chairman emeritus Bruce Nordstrom; and Anne Gittinger.Nordstrom said it has formed a special committee with independent directors to evaluate any offer from the Nordstrom family and has retained Centerview Partners to serve as its financial adviser with Sidley Austin to serve as its legal counsel."
30;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-05-13T12:05:29Z;US retail sector’s misery — in charts;Unexpectedly sharp decline in department store sales felt across the markets;"Investors wiped $4.6bn from the market value of the US department store sector in the space of two days last week, as concern mounted about sliding sales and the effects of online competition.The consequences are spilling into the real estate and derivatives markets, and the latest bad news has intensified the focus on the sector ahead of more earnings reports from retail heavyweights next week.A quintet of big US department stores this week disclosed declines in like-for-like sales for the first three months of the year. The figures that were revealed by Macy’s, Kohl’s, Dillard’s, Nordstrom and JC Penney were below most analysts’ forecasts, suggesting Wall Street has still not got a handle on how fast things are deteriorating in the sector.The disappointment ignited a sell-off that sent the market value of the S&P department stores index sliding from $27.8bn on Wednesday to $23.2bn on Friday, marking the biggest two-day wipeout in dollar terms since the 2008 financial crisis. This despite some commentary from executives that they had seen an improvement since the start of spring.Here is how the individual stocks fared:● Macy’s and Dillard’s each ended down 18.5 per cent● JC Penney fell 17.1 per cent● Nordstrom was down 15.9 per cent● Kohl’s fell 9.1 per centThe anxiety was not limited to the equities market.Investors marked up the cost of insuring against defaults on department stores’ debt, and on the debt of other groups that are vulnerable to consumers’ shift away from bricks-and-mortar shopping.Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s were three of the worst four performers in Markit’s index of credit-default swaps of investment-grade companies this week. Spreads also widened for the CDS tracking the debt of electronics retailer Best Buy, Simon Properties, the biggest US mall operator, and discount chain Target.Real estate investment trusts that own and operate retail properties, like shopping malls, were among the worst-performing industry groups on the S&P 500 index this week. The broad benchmark ended the week down 0.35 per cent, while the retail Reit group was off 4.1 per cent.The fall this week deepens the year-to-date decline for retail Reits to 12.3 per cent, versus 1.5 per cent for the whole Reits sector.Here is a round-up of how individual retail Reits performed this week:● Macerich, which operates malls in the western US, fell 5.6 per cent● Kimco Realty, which focuses on open-air shopping centres, was down 5.1 per cent● Simon Properties, the largest player in the group, slipped 4.3 per cent● GGP, the second-biggest group by market value, slipped 1.9 per centMarvin Ellison, chief executive at JCPenney: “While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp-store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February.”James Nordstrom, Nordstrom president: “While there may be opportunities to close underperforming stores, that’s not really part of our strategy. We don’t have a closure strategy. We have a market share strategy.”Jeff Gennette, Macy’s chief executive: “These are unusual and challenging times for retail, especially for mall-based department stores. We know that these changes we’re seeing are secular and not cyclical.”The weakness in sales is affecting the bottom line.According to FactSet, department stores and apparel retailers are expected to average declines of 6 per cent or more in net income for the first quarter. Profits at general merchandise stores are faring even worse, whereas internet retailers are on a tear. Their net income is expected to be up more than a quarter, on average.If department stores are uniformly losing out in the changing retail landscape, the companies that are reporting next week may be more of a mixed bag.So far off-price retailers, which offer rapidly changing selections of designer names at a sharp discount to retail prices, have bucked the gloom. Investors will tune in next week to see if TJX Cos, behind chains such as TJ Maxx and Marshalls; and Ross Stores, had a better start to the year than their traditional rivals, even though those traditional rivals have recently started to push their own lower-price offerings.Meanwhile, Target had a difficult holiday season as customers turned to Amazon and Walmart. But next week investors get to hear if chief executive Brian Cornell’s efforts to lure customers back by lowering prices, sprucing up stores, and introducing new brands is paying off."
31;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-05-11T20:31:49Z;Nordstrom shares slip further after it misses on key retail metric;;After a day-long retail bloodbath on Wall Street, US department-store chain Nordstrom saw its shares slip further in after-hours trading on Thursday after reporting that comparable sales — a key industry metric — fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.The company said that comparable sales were down 0.8 per cent versus a year earlier, compared to expectations for that figure to remain flat during the three-month period ending April 29. It’s the fourth department store today to miss comparable-sale estimates, which dragged on retail shares all day.Despite that miss, Nordstrom managed to eke out a beat on other earnings figures, reporting total revenue of $3.35bn, versus the $3.33bn expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings per diluted share were 37 cents on net earnings of $63m, beating the 27 cent-per-share estimate by a full dime.The company’s discount Nordstrom Rack line of stores remains a bright spot, however, with net sales increasing 8.7 per cent and comparable sales up 2.3 per cent for the quarter, compared to a 1.7 per cent decline in net sales and 2.8 fall in comp sales at its namesake department-store chain.Nordstrom also reiterated its earlier guidance for comparable sales to remain flat throughout 2017.Amid the earlier retail carnage, Nordstrom shares fell 7.6 per cent ahead of the earnings announcement, along with shares of rival US department store chains. Shares fell as much as 6 per cent after the announcement, although that had been trimmed to a 2.6 per cent decline at pixel time.
32;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-05-11T17:52:44Z;Nordstrom, JC Penney hit by retail fallout;;Last season’s fashions aren’t the only things getting marked down.US department-store chains Nordstrom and JC Penney are among the retail shares getting hammered after a dismal round of earnings released earlier in the day from competitors including Macy’s, Kohl’s and Dillard’s.Nordstrom — which is set to announce earnings later today — was down 7.7 per cent in midday trading. JC Penney shares were off 7.5 per cent, a day ahead of its own earnings release, while Sears was down 9 per cent. Some non-department stores were also feeling the pinch, with Gap off 3.7 per cent, teen-centric American Eagle Outfitters off 5.1 per cent and Urban Outfitters falling 3.7 per cent.The declines come as shares of Macy’s, Kohl’s and Dillard’s remain in a free-fall after reporting another quarter of steep declines in comparable sales, a key industry metric. Retailers are facing unprecedented upheaval amid falling mall traffic, shifting consumer shopping patterns and fierce competition, with department stores — a mall staple for decades — shouldering the brunt of the shift.
33;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-02-23T21:49:25Z;Nordstrom earnings top forecasts, sales boosted by Rack brand;;Nordstrom shares ticked higher after the department store posted upbeat fourth quarter earnings and said sales ticked higher as consumers flocked to its discount Nordstrom Rack brand.The Seattle-based company said total revenues rose 3 per cent to $4.3bn, broadly in line with analysts’ estimates. While sales at its full-line stores fell 1.1 per cent from a year ago, sales at the Nordstrom Rack brand climbed 10.7 per cent.Overall, comparable sales at the company slid 0.9 per cent, worse than the expected 0.3 per cent gain. However, comparable sales rose 4.3 per cent at the Rack brand.Nordstrom Rack has helped the company compete with discount retailers like TJX Cos that offer branded clothing at reduced prices. Indeed, the results showed that while the number of full-line US stores were unchanged at 118 at the end of fiscal 2017, compared with the year ago period, Nordstrom Rack stores climbed to 215, from 194.Profits rose to $201m, or $1.15 a share, in line with Wall Street estimates, compared with $180m, or $1 a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.37 a share topped forecasts.The company also noted that its gross margin improved by 112 basis points to 36 per cent and that its inventory declined 2.3 per cent.Nordstrom’s upbeat results follow disappointing earnings from rivals like Macy’s and Kohl’s. The department store complex has been challenged by increasing competition from fast fashion retailers like H&M and Zara and ecommerce markets like Amazon.The department store has also largely shrugged off criticism from US President Donald Trump, who said the company treated his daughter “so unfairly” after it dropped Ivanka Trump products from its stores and website — a move it attributed to the brand’s performance.Looking ahead, the company said it expects net sales to rise between 3 to 4 per cent in fiscal 2017, ahead of the 2.4 per cent advance registered last year. Comparable sales are expected to be flat. It also projected full-year earnings in the range of $2.75 to $3 a share.Nordstrom shares had dipped suddenly in the final hour of trade on Thursday along with other retailers and department stores, but were up 3.7 per cent in extended trading following results. Shares in the department store have declined more than 8 per cent so far this year
34;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-02-10T20:45:12Z;Ingram Pinn’s illustration of the week: The Trump effect;Presidential tweets do little for Twitter yet Nordstrom soars;Donald Trump, “the Twitter president”, seems to have done little to deliver the Trump bump to Twitter that had been predicted. Shares in the social media company fell 11 per cent on the week.Meanwhile Mr Trump’s angry tweets criticising Nordstrom, which had stopped stocking his daughter Ivanka’s clothing brand, seem to have had the opposite effect. The retail chain’s shares sprouted wings and ended the week 3.5 per cent higher.
35;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
36;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-02-09T10:30:03Z;Are Trump’s tweets a boost or a blow to companies?;FT analysis shows most stocks are little moved by presidential blame or praise;When Donald Trump tweeted his displeasure with Nordstrom on Wednesday for its decision to stop selling his daughter Ivanka’s merchandise, the retailer’s shares quickly dropped about 0.5 per cent. Yet within the hour they had rallied and by the end of the day they closed up more than 4 per cent.The same day, the president typed out words of praise for Brian Krzanich, after the Intel chief executive announced plans for a $7bn investment in an Arizona semiconductor factory. That tweet generated even less excitement, leaving Intel’s stock almost unmoved.Despite companies’ fears that one angry Trump tweet can decimate a group’s stock market valuation, these muted market reactions are the norm, according to a Financial Times analysis of the commander-in-chief’s use of Twitter since the beginning of 2017. On average, a tweeted Trump insult has almost zero impact on the targeted company’s share price within an hour of investors having a chance to react. Praise from Mr Trump, on the other hand, has on average led to about a 1 per cent bump in the target company’s stock price in the first trading hour that follows it, although that effect typically starts to dissipate within 24 hours.Praise does not guarantee a positive share price move. For example, in mid-January Mr Trump tweeted, “Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!”. In the hour after the tweet, Walmart stock rose a bit, but GM’s stock price sank about 0.3 per cent. Twenty-four hours later, the companies’ stocks were down about 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively.Media companies have been Mr Trump’s most regular Twitter targets since the beginning of the year. The New York Times, NBC and CNN in particular have each been subjected to presidential vitriol a few times, but if Mr Trump hoped to financially wound those organisations with his tweets, he fell short. Mr Trump’s opprobrium has had no negative effect, on average, on the share prices of the news outlets’ parent companies. A Trump Twitter insult targeted at a media brand correlates on average with a minuscule drop in share price over the course of an hour, followed by a slight bump by the end of the day.Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, reported on Wednesday that it beat fourth-quarter revenue estimates, thanks in part to CNN, which had a record year in 2016. The New York Times reported its biggest-ever boost in digital subscriptions, part of which came in a post-election surge.This is not to say that Mr Trump’s Twitter feed offers no opportunity for fast-moving investors. A report from S&P Global Market Intelligence shows that the president’s tweets do appear to have a short-term impact on how markets see a company’s credit risk. The commander-in-chief’s tweeting also seems to have an effect on the Mexican peso.The sample size so far in 2017 includes fewer than three dozen company-related tweets, and it is also possible that Mr Trump’s Twitter use could yet cause sharper share price moves. A tweet about a policy with large ramifications for a company, for instance, could have a more serious impact on its stock than a tweet expressing his distaste for a certain group. However, previous tweets about inflicting potential penalties on companies have had no such impact. When Mr Trump tweeted that General Motors should build its Chevrolet Cruze model in the US or pay a “big border tax”, the carmaker’s share price went up.
37;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-02-08T23:42:09Z;Donald Trump berates Nordstrom for dropping Ivanka brand;Attack on retailer marks president’s first comment on company with ties to his family;Donald Trump has lambasted Nordstrom for abandoning his daughter’s fashion label, tweeting that the department store chain had treated Ivanka Trump “so unfairly” when it decided not to buy her brand this season.The US president has been a vociferous critic of companies whose business decisions he feels clash with his policies, but he had refrained since his inauguration from commenting on any company with business relationships with his family members.His tweets and comments have left companies scrambling to respond out of fear of alienating either the new administration or consumers who disapprove of it.Nordstrom shares shrugged off the unwelcome attention, closing 4.1 per cent higher at $44.53 on a day when the S&P rose just 0.1 per cent.Late last week, the Seattle-based department store chain said Ms Trump’s clothes, shoes and accessories were selling too poorly to continue stocking the brand. Its decision followed the #GrabYourWallet campaign to boycott stores that carry Ms Trump’s label, but Nordstrom insisted at the time that it was driven by purely economic factors and had nothing to do with politics.“My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday.Highlighting the fine line between government and personal business that Mr Trump and his administration is treading, his spokesman Sean Spicer defended the president’s criticism of Nordstrom as a father’s duty after “an attack on his daughter”.“For someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is not acceptable. And the president has every right as a father to stand up for them,” Mr Spicer said at a briefing.In response, Nordstrom on Wednesday reiterated that the company’s decision was based solely on the brand’s performance.“Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,” it said in a statement.“We’ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. We’ve had open conversations with them over the past year to share what we’ve seen and Ivanka was personally informed of our decision in early January.”Nordstrom did not provide any sales figures, but data compiled by Slice Intelligence, the market intelligence firm, showed a 26.9 per cent drop in Nordstrom’s online sales of the Ivanka Trump brand last year, a reversal from the 67.3 per cent online revenue growth it saw in 2015.The president’s intervention came as the New York Times reported that TJ Maxx, the retailer of discounted brands, had written to its staff requesting them to remove signs promoting Ivanka Trump merchandise.TJ Maxx said it continued to stock the brand. “The communication we sent instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor,” it said in a statement.Having moved to Washington, Ms Trump said she would take “formal leave of absence” from her father’s property company and her fashion label, and would no longer be involved in management or operations.It is unclear whether this has yet taken place, with ProPublica, the US non-profit news organisation, reporting that she had yet to file the relevant paperwork with the regulators.
38;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-02-08T16:15:07Z;Nordstrom shares shrug off critical Trump tweet;;Department store Nordstrom’s shares bounced back quickly after dipping on Wednesday morning following a tweet in which US President Donald Trump said the company had treated his daughter Ivanka “so unfairly” by stopping sales of her fashion label.The company’s shares dropped about 0.5 per cent before quickly recovering to trade up 0.2 per cent in the minutes after the commander-in-chief’s latest social media missive.The quick shrug-off by investors suggests that perhaps Mr Trump’s tweets targeting specific companies may be starting to lose some of their immediate shock value – for now. Since Mr Trump took office, corporations have been treading carefully in their media messages and staying on alert in case they are the next to be named in a Twitter post or speech.Nordstrom announced last week that it had decided not to buy Ivanka Trump products for this season, not as a political statement but in response to what it said was the brand’s performance.
39;JWN;Nordstrom;2017-02-03T11:44:28Z;Nordstrom drops Ivanka Trump brand;US retailer says decision not ‘political’ but based on poor sales;Nordstrom is to stop selling the Ivanka Trump brand, in a setback for the fashion label of Donald Trump’s daughter amid pressure on retailers to boycott her products.The Seattle-based department store chain said on Twitter late on Thursday that it had “decided not to buy” Ivanka Trump products for this season, but said it was “not a political decision“ but instead “based on the brand’s performance”.Nordstrom said: “We’ve got thousands of brands, more than 2,000 offered on the site alone. Reviewing their merit and making edits is part of the regular rhythm of our business.“Each year we cut about 10 per cent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand’s performance we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.”Nordstrom did not disclose sales figures for the Ivanka Trump brand of clothes, shoes and accessories. But data compiled by Slice Intelligence, the market intelligence firm, showed a 26.9 per cent drop in Nordstrom’s online sales of Ivanka Trump last year, compared with 67.3 per cent online revenue growth in 2015.The poor performance at Nordstrom, historically Ivanka Trump’s biggest source of online sales, dragged down the brand’s overall online revenues in 2016 at its five largest merchants, according to Slice. Sales on Zappos.com of the Ivanka Trump brand were down 18.2 per cent last year. However, sales rose 22.5 per cent on Amazon and 35 per cent and 38.7 per cent at Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s respectively, during the year.By Friday, Ivanka Trump had been removed from the list of brands available on Nordstrom’s website. Four styles of the company’s women’s shoes remained for sale on the site, though all of the products were listed at a 40 per cent discount.The Ivanka Trump brand did not comment directly on the Nordstrom move but Rosemary K. Young, a senior marketing director, said in statement that it “continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016.”“We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains,” she said.Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of the US president, said last month that she would take a “formal leave of absence” from the Trump Organization and her eponymous label when her father took office, and would “no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company”.ProPublica, the US non-profit news organisation, reported on Thursday that Ms Trump had yet to file her resignation with regulators, and remained listed as a director of Trump businesses in Florida and New York.Ms Trump, who recently moved to Washington, has no formal role in the Trump White House. Her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser to the US president.Nordstrom’s decision to stop stocking the Ivanka Trump brand underscores the increasing complicated pressures placed on US companies, especially those looking to stay out of party politics.Many US consumers have rallied behind the #GrabYourWallet social media campaign, which urges shoppers to protest against the US president’s crude comments about women by boycotting retailers selling Trump brands, including Amazon, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus and Lord & Taylor. A search of the Neiman Marcus website on Friday yielded no mention of the Ivanka Trump brand.Shannon Coulter, who started the campaign, said on Twitter late on Thursday that she was “dazzled to see this many flexing their consumer power in favor of a more respectful, inclusive US”[sic].Retailers are not the only companies under pressure to cut ties with the Trump administration.Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick quit the president’s business advisory council on Thursday after mounting criticism over the president’s immigration order. Mr Kalanick’s decision is expected to put pressure on the other executives on the council, including management from Blackstone, IBM, GE, GM, Disney, Pepsi and Tesla.Meanwhile, Trump supporters have also taken to boycotting companies that have taken a stance against the US president.Last weekend, Starbucks chairman and chief executive Howard Schultz criticised Mr Trump’s immigration clampdown in a memo to staff, and said the coffee chain planned to hire 10,000 refugees in the next five years. Almost immediately, Trump supporters launched their own #BoycottStarbucks social media campaign.

Its net income was impacted by a non-cash goodwill impairment of $197m tied to TrunkClub, the personal styling service provider it acquired in 2014.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 84 cents, eclipsed expectations for 51 cents. Moreover, the company’s gross profit margin climbed 93 basis points year-on-year to 34.8 per cent.Nordstrom’s results follow upbeat commentary from other department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s on Thursday. Department stores had come under pressure from a rise in online shopping and off-price stores like TJX Cos, which sells discounted brands for cheap. But they have also benefitted from weaker year-ago comparisons in the third quarter.The company had previously forecast full-year earnings in the range of $2.60 to $2.75 a share. Excluding the impairment charge, Nordstrom now expects to earn between $2.85 to $2.95 a share. Including it however, it expects to earn between $1.70 to $1.80 a share.Meanwhile, net sales are expected to climb about 3.5 per cent, in the middle of its previous outlook, which called for between 2.5 and 4.5 per cent growth.Nordstrom shares are up 12.5 per cent so far this year.
41;JWN;Nordstrom;2016-09-06T06:00:15Z;Mutual fund managers find summer rewards in emerging markets;Top performers return more than 20% in 14 weeks between Memorial and Labor Day holidays;The summer of 2016 may have ended as one of the quietest and least volatile for US markets in memory, but there has been money to be made nonetheless. Just ask the fund managers who specialise in emerging markets or precious metals.In the 14 weeks between the Memorial day and Labor Day holidays — that period where market lore tells investors to “sell in May and go away” — the top-performing mutual funds managers returned more than 20 per cent this year.And even larger profits were available for the buyers of some exchange traded funds and individual stocks.The gains have gone disproportionately to asset classes that benefit from low interest rates, as markets settled into a view that the US Federal Reserve will keep rates low in the short term and may not ever raise them back to historical norms.“There is a lot of money in play on that single factor,” said Shanquan Li, manager of the Oppenheimer Gold & Special Minerals Fund, whose 27.4 per cent gain since Memorial day on May 30 is the best performance of all US mutual funds with over $1bn in assets.Mr Li’s $1.3bn fund invests in mainly small- and mid-cap gold mining stocks, to magnify the impact of changes in the gold price, which has risen 9.3 per cent over the summer. With rates staying low, the lack of yield on precious metals is less of a deterrent to investors, some of whom also see gold as a hedge against any inflation generated by loose monetary policy.Gold-focused mutual funds from Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and Tocqueville Asset Management are also among the best performers, according to data from Morningstar.Meanwhile, emerging markets have seen growing interest throughout the summer, as US fixed-income investors sought higher yields overseas and equity investors expected capital to continue flowing into emerging economies and forecast China would continue to stimulate demand.Two “smart beta” mutual funds from Pimco, which buy emerging markets stocks, are in Morningstar’s top 10, but the biggest gains have fallen to buyers of exchange traded funds designed to give exposure to individual countries.Investors’ enthusiasm for the change of political leadership in Brazil— plus early signs of an earnings recovery at the country’s recession-hit companies — has generated a 31 per cent gain for an iShares fund that tracks the country’s stock market. China funds also surged in value.After a sharp rise in the wake of the UK Brexit vote, volatility in the US stock market remained subdued as the summer came to an end, but individual stockpickers were still able to enjoy gains of more than 50 per cent on large-cap stocks.Chesapeake Energy, whose large debt burden has frightened many long-term investors out of the stock, jumped 59 per cent, the most by any S&P 500 constituent. It has been pulling itself back from the brink of bankruptcy, thanks to a debt restructuring and the sale of assets. And Seagate Technology, whose business manufacturing computer disks is under pressure, soared on news of a restructuring that involves laying off 6,500 employees, about 14 per cent of the workforce.Investors have also warmed to microchip stocks such as Micron Technology and Nvidia, and to retailers, including Gap and Nordstrom.The question is how markets will fare as traders and investors return to work following the extended break, and some strategists are warning that summer trends may cool, particularly the enthusiasm for emerging markets.“I believe there is a ‘one-offness’ to what has happened,” said Bhanu Baweja, strategist at UBS. “Emerging markets have had a tremendous and exceptional fair wind this year. We have seen the biggest decline in US real interest rates in years, but even if rates stay low, that is now priced in.”
42;JWN;Nordstrom;2016-08-12T21:22:37Z;Nordstrom adds cheer to retail shares;Strong week for department stores fails to lift S&P and Dow on the day;Nordstrom had another stock market jump on Friday, after its earnings beat expectations and the upscale US department store group lifted its outlook for the year.While the Seattle-based company’s net income fell more than 44 per cent to $117m in the three months through to the end of July, the drop was better than analysts expected, driven by investments in technology and ecommerce.Nordstrom also raised its full-year earnings outlook to $2.60-$2.75 a share. While this is still well below the $3.10-$3.35 range the company had targeted before a surprise profit warning in May, investors were cheered by the news.The department store’s shares — which had already bounced almost 10 per cent this week thanks to earnings beats by Macy’s and Kohl’s — gained another 8 per cent to trade at a four-month high of $51.38 by the close of trade in New York.“Over the past several quarters, our team has been actively addressing our inventory, expense and capital, and in the second quarter, made substantial progress by bringing down inventory in-line with sales,” said Blake Nordstrom, the company’s co-president.Despite US retail sales unexpectedly falling in July, which damped optimism that the economy is back on a recovery path, Nordstrom’s results and stock bounce caps a good week for US department stores. The S&P sub-index, which includes the Seattle company, Macy’s and Kohl’s, gained 16.4 per cent this week, its best weekly performance since November 2008.Shares in JC Penney also rose on Friday after the retailer reported a rise in sales and margins as Marvin Ellison, new chief executive, continues to turn round the company. Its shares gained 6.1 per cent to $10.55, the highest since April.“We are pleased with the sequential improvement we achieved throughout the second quarter, and our solid performance across all key metrics is encouraging,” he said.The strong week for department stores failed to lift the broader US stock market, however, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices slipping slightly after they and the Nasdaq hit a “trifecta” of record highs on Thursday. At the close, the S&P and Dow were down 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. The Nasdaq ticked up 0.1 per cent.A big contributor to the S&P 500’s dip was Microsoft, which fell 0.6 per cent to $57.94. Technology shares were overall down 0.1 per cent.Still, another bounce in crude oil prices helped US energy companies, with the sub-index gaining 0.7 per cent thanks to the 2.9 per cent gain in West Texas Intermediate oil. The US crude benchmark reached a three-week high of $44.70 a barrel. That boosted the shares of ExxonMobil, the biggest US energy company, by 1.3 per cent to $87.85.In Canada, attention was focused on Concordia International, a pharmaceuticals company. Its shares plummeted 39.1 per cent to C$12.95, a three-year low after it lowered its sales and profit outlook, suspended its quarterly dividend and said its chief financial officer was leaving.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed nearly unchanged at 17,526.62, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 4,739.12.Elsewhere, Lowe’s shares advanced more than 3.3 per cent to $78.60 after the DIY chain reported stronger than expected first-quarter profits amid strong demand for home improvement goods.Profits at the retailer rose to $884m, or 98 cents a share, up from $673m or 70 cents a share in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 87 cents a share topped expectations for 85 cents. Meanwhile, sales rose 7.8 per cent to $15.2bn, ahead of forecasts.Target shares fell 7.6 per cent to $67.99 after the company reported a smaller than expected increase in first quarter like-for-like sales during a challenging period for US department stores.The company said that same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 1.2 per cent, below expectations for a 1.6 per cent rise.The company said that it expected comparable sales in the current quarter to be in a range of flat or down as much as 2 per cent.The news sent shares in rival Walmart nearly 3 per cent lower to $63.14. Target’s soft sales figures followed dismal results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s.Meanwhile, shares in Hormel Foods, fell 8.6 per cent to $35.47 and were among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 after margins shrunk in its refrigerated foods division, raising concerns about the maker of Spam and Jenny-O Turkey.Profit margins for the company’s largest division fell to 11.9 per cent in the fiscal second quarter, from 14.4 per cent the previous quarter, said Akshay Jagdale, an analyst at Jefferies.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
44;JWN;Nordstrom;2016-05-13T18:58:57Z;US retail: in a box;Ecommerce is hardly a pot of gold;Successful retailing has two pillars. The aesthetics must to be right, and the supply chain must run smooth. America’s big apparel merchants, such as Macy’s, Gap, Nordstrom or Kohl’s are wobbly on both. All four announced sales shortfalls this week.No one disputes that the big chains have a glamour problem. Basics that are cheap and cheerful, found at the likes of H&M or Zara, and the fancier stuff on a discount rack at, say, TJX have beaten the middlebrow fare of department and speciality stores.Next, consider the choice of sales channel. Incumbents have started to boast of their “omnichannel” capabilities, with online and store sales complementing each other. This could have been one channel too many. Focus on online innovation may only have distracted from the creeping rot on the store side. Consultant Green Street Advisors thinks that anchor tenants in shopping malls would need to shutter a fifth of their stores to reach the productivity levels — sales per square foot — of a decade ago.Money has flooded into internet retail start-ups, but in the US there is no independent online fashion success story to match the UK’s Asos. Most are either flops (fab.com, Gilt Group) or burning millions in venture capital trying to get off the ground (Jet.com). The challenge of handling fast home deliveries is its own headache. The profits have slipped away from the big rag merchants. Will they reappear? Perhaps, once a lot of stores have shut and a lot of start-ups have wound down. Until then, invest elsewhere.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
45;JWN;Nordstrom;2016-02-19T22:22:36Z;Deere to cut profit forecasts on strong dollar;Dow edges lower while Nasdaq ticks up;Deere shares fell sharply after the largest maker of tractors and other agricultural equipment cut its sales and profit forecast for this year.The US company, which also supplies equipment to the construction industry, warned that it expected a “challenging year” as it chalked up a drop in quarterly profits.Like many US multinationals, the strength of the dollar is exacerbating the deterioration in the company’s underlying business. Deere said foreign-exchange will knock about 3 per cent off its full-year sales, which it now expects to be 10 per cent down on 2015.Just three months ago, Deere, which is based in the US farming heartland of Illinois, was projecting a 7 per cent decline. The steeper drop will trim profits for the year to $1.3bn, down from a November forecast of $1.4bn.The shares dropped 4.2 per cent to $77, making it one of the biggest decliners on the S&P 500.Samuel Allen, Deere’s chief executive and chairman, said “our forecast represents a level of performance much better than we have experienced in previous downturns”.Friday’s decline, though, wasn’t enough to knock the stock into negative territory for the year. The shares are up 1 per cent, comfortably outperforming the 6.2 per cent decline in the S&P 500.Shares in Nordstrom fell 6.7 per cent to $49.17 after the US department store chain issued a disappointing earnings outlook even as the company said it gained market share in both its full-price and off-price businesses.The Seattle-based company said it expected full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $3.10 to $3.35 a share, below estimates for $3.55. Sales are expected to rise between 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.The news came alongside a 1 per cent rise in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, ahead of estimates for a 0.4 per cent gain.Profits slid to $180m, or $1 a share, in the quarter ended in January, compared with $255m, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 5 per cent to $4.1bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $1.21 a share, on sales of $4.2bn.The retailer increased markdowns in response to elevated competitor discounting during the key holiday shopping season in the US weighed on profits.Department store chains have had a tough time as consumers spend less on clothes and the stores face increasing pressure from off-price retailers such as TJ Maxx, which offer branded clothing at a discount.Best Buy shares fell 2.6 per cent to $29.95, after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the electronics retailer to “neutral” from “buy” and lifted their price target by a dollar to $33.The “buy” thesis was based on Best Buy’s strength in the television market but Matthew Fassler, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: “We expect a sluggish wireless market to overshadow ongoing strength in TV sales, driving a choppy sales performance, particularly in the first half of 2016, when our sales and earnings forecasts stand below consensus.”The S&P 500 materials sector was the worst performing on the benchmark index.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,917.78, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 16,391.99. The Nasdaq Composite edged 0.4 per cent higher to 4,504.43.
46;JWN;Nordstrom;2015-12-29T12:08:24Z;Department stores: still serving;Despite existential threats, department stores can still make reasonable investments;A simple post-Christmas task to ease you back in after all the turkey: build a bear case for the department store. It should be straightforward. Assailed by the internet on one side and fast-moving, niche specialists on the other, the lumbering department store looks like a jack of all trades and a master of none. Its customers are ageing, and the next generation will shop elsewhere.With those principles laid out, you can present the evidence. Exhibit one: a profit warning from Macy’s in November, which bemoaned “tepid” spending by domestic customers. Exhibit two: data from Euromonitor showing that sales at US department stores have shrunk by 8 per cent since 2010. Exhibit three: shares in Macy’s, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Sears and JC Penney have all underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years (years when, remember, the US economy has been recovering). The case looks well proven. Shut them all down now.And yet somehow the department stores are surviving, on both sides of the Atlantic. Even those that may seem troubled are not doomed. Just look at JC Penney, which had a torrid time in 2012 and 2013. A turnround plan is in place and like-for-like sales have been growing nicely this year (third-quarter same-store sales were up 6.4 per cent). The shares have responded by rising a tenth in the year to date — at their September peak they were up 59 per cent. It is still possible to make money investing in department stores.Still, unless you are especially adept at picking the turnrounds, most of that money is likely to be made via dividends. There are some decent yields around — Macy’s, Kohl’s and the UK’s Debenhams and Marks and Spencer all offer around 4 per cent. The department stores may be able to arrest their decline with fresh looks, new ranges and click & collect services, but life is not about to get easier. Department stores are not finished yet, but stick with those that can offer relatively stable profits to fund decent cash returns.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
47;JWN;Nordstrom;2015-11-18T17:28:10Z;Warming US economy leaves retailers cold;Some of the biggest names at the mall report sluggish sales as their critical holiday season starts;The US economy is brightening, but consumers are not spending on clothes. As stores approach the critical holiday shopping season, third-quarter sales at some of the biggest names in retailing have been sluggish.Groups from Macy’s to Urban Outfitters have reported falling revenues and missed analysts’ estimates in recent days, pushing the S&P Retail Select Industry Index down 8.5 per cent last week to mark the sector’s worst week since May 2012.Urban Outfitters earlier this week reported a same-store-sales increase of just 1 per cent, short of analysts’ expectations for a 3.4 per cent gain, which sent the stock sharply lower as the fashion and accessories chain perplexed the market with a plan to buy a restaurant chain.Even Nordstrom, the usually resilient upmarket department store chain, has not been able to produce buoyant sales. “There area a number of [broad] economic indicators that look real positive for the US and the consumer and spending” Blake Nordstrom, co-president of the eponymous department store told investors, “yet all we can tell you is in our business we saw a slowdown and it was across the board.”Top line US consumer spending expanded 3.2 per cent in the third quarter, government data show. This helped the US market shine a little brighter than many in a global economy showing muted growth, saddled with slowing emerging market expansion and a eurozone struggling to find momentum. But the slower growth elsewhere has had an impact on tourist sales in the US, Macy’s has complained.Wage growth at home has shown signs of improvement, though plenty of people in lower income brackets are still very much feeling the pinch.If Mr Nordstrom is correct, and consumers are starting to hold back, that is worrying for other retailers, which are already struggling to differentiate themselves in an environment where the winners are either fast fashion companies, such as H&M and Forever 21, or groups with strong brands such as Nike.They are also having to compete for dollars that are going on higher rent and healthcare costs. Lower fuel prices have boosted consumers’ disposable income, but the benefit is being spent on activities such as dining out and entertainment a JPMorgan Chase Institute report showed. Auto sales have also been robust.As retailers enter the two-month holiday shopping period, which can account for as much as 30 per cent of annual sales, many of them now have lots of inventory to whittle down. Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell said, “we worry that promotional activity will likely lead to a fight to the bottom on margins, which could potentially lead to misses in fourth quarter”.Neil Saunders, an analyst at research group Conlumino, added in a recent report: “American consumers remain caught in a netherworld of being less gloomy than they were in the depths of the downturn, but far less optimistic than they were in the period before it. Many are uncertain about the future and this is colouring their spending habits.”Gap is being attacked from all angles. Its main brand has lost ground to fast fashion chains among younger shoppers, who prefer a wider choice of styles and do not want a brand name emblazoned across their clothing. At the same time, it has failed to cash in on the rise of athletic leisure wear — jeans sales are suffering, while yoga pants are increasingly being seen as acceptable at the office.It recently lost the head of Old Navy, Stefan Larsson— credited with turning round that brand — to Ralph Lauren, and the company appears to be caught in a cycle of constant promotions. Its third-quarter sales fell 2 per cent compared with last year, after dropping by the same amount in the second quarter, amid shrinking demand for its Gap and Banana Republic brands.It is closing 175 stores, leaving 800 in North America, and shedding head office staff as it seeks to to focus more closely on higher-growth areas such as e-commerce, factory outlet stores and international operations.Bridget Weishaar, an analyst at Morningstar, argues that once Gap has improved its supply chain and inventory management, and invested more in blending its online and bricks-and-mortar offerings, its 13 per cent average operating margin should start catching up with the high-teen levels seen at Inditex and H&M.All US clothing retailers are struggling with the same fundamental trend — the share of consumer spending devoted to apparel has fallen from 5.4 per cent in 1990 to 3.3 per cent last year.In the fight for that shrinking pie, Nordstrom has largely long been regarded as a winner.So its slowdown in same store sales growth to just 0.9 per cent in the third quarter took the market by surprise, not least because analysts approve of its business model, expansion plans and ecommerce arm.With little sign of rivals taking up the slack, and Macy’s warning that its full-year sales could fall as much as 3.1 per cent instead of the earlier forecast 1 per cent, Nordstrom’s surprise weakness suggested a “potential cautionary tale of the US consumers’ health”, wrote Deutsche Bank’s Mr Trussell.Nordstrom is slashing inventory and cutting costs, but analysts expect further challenges in the fourth quarter. This has weighed on its shares and bonds in the past week.But its troubles are not as great as those of Macy’s, whose struggle to lift sales on the back of investing in the in-store experience has left its credit default swaps trading at their widest in three years. Conlumino noted that Macy’s did not really have the financial muscle to upgrade all its stores, while it is also rolling out “off-price” stores, with lower-price ranges, to compete against Nordstrom’s off-rack stores and TJX, a growing area.“The wider truth is that Macy’s remains a business that is somewhat out of kilter with what modern consumers want,” Conlumino’s Mr Saunders said.Retailers face another threat besides the rise of ecommerce: back-breaking levels of debt.Companies in the sector have racked up nearly $183bn in debt to fund share buybacks, increase dividends and plot their expansions — more than double the level before the financial crisis and up 68 per cent from five years earlier, according to Barclays Indices.For the likes of Neiman Marcus, owner of the high-end Manhattan department store Bergdorf Goodman, the timing could not be worse. Executives find themselves using their cash to fund interest payments when analysts argue they should be investing in their underlying businesses to bolster sales.Neiman Marcus was forced to postpone a planned initial public offering this year amid wider market volatility, weighing on its $4.7bn in long-term debts.Previously, investors took the view that the gradual US recovery would allow retailers saddled with debt from leveraged buyouts — including Neiman Marcus, J Crew and Toys R Us — to begin to reduce their obligations. But with malaise hitting big rivals including Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s, a unit of Macy’s, upmarket Neiman has struggled to balance debt payments with its other priorities.The Texas-based retailer warned in September that same-store sales growth had slowed in its latest quarter, rising 1.9 per cent from a year earlier. In contrast, between fiscal 2012 and 2014 Neiman averaged comparable revenue growth of 6.1 per cent.“Retail is tough and it’s hard to make money,” Mary Bowers, portfolio manager with HSBC Global Asset Management, says. “In some of the more recent LBOs, the leverage was too high.”Bonds issued by the purveyor of posh offerings from Prada, Lanvin and Valentino have tumbled more than 10 per cent since the month began, last trading at 91.5 cents on the dollar.Executives keen to wean consumers off steep discounts have found the prospect daunting. Men’s Wearhouse, the suit seller that bought rival Jos A Bank last year for $1.8bn, fell into the same trap that befell JC Penney years earlier.The company has started to reduce the promotional blitz that drove men across the US to Jos A Bank stores: buy one, get three free. The unit’s same-store sales slid 14.6 per cent in the third quarter and are expected to decline as much as 25 per cent in the fiscal fourth as the number of customers to its stores dwindles.Bonds issued by the group have declined 25 per cent from a high in July, trading at 81 cents on the dollar, while its shares have plummeted more than 50 per cent.Debt investors are also growing concerned about other clothing chains as the prospect of a US rate rise looms. Yields on bonds issued by US retailers have climbed from 3 to 3.4 per cent since the beginning of the year.Analysts at Wells Fargo say that stores have been “less promotional” at the start of November than in past years as they attempt to break consumers out of their habit of waiting for a sale. But that may prove short lived as “elevated” inventory levels weigh on the sector, the bank adds.“We no longer have confidence,” is the view from analysts at Jefferies.

The news accompanied better than expected third-quarter results.Weight Watchers International shares gained more than 3 per cent to $23.66 after billionaire Steven Cohen’s Point 72 Asset Management disclosed a 5.7 per cent stake in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.Mr Cohen, who wound down his hedge fund, SAC Capital, after the company pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013, controls 3.8m shares through his investment firm Point 72. The news arrives after media titan Oprah Winfrey disclosed a 10 per cent stake in the company back in October.Dean Foods shares gained 5 per cent to $18.86 after the dairy company reported better-than expected third-quarter results and issued current quarter profit outlook that topped estimates.The Dallas-based company reported profits of $20.2m, or 22 cents a share, in the three months ended in September.Sales slid 14 per cent to $2.03bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of 17 cents a share, on sales of $2.04bn.The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 28-38 cents a share, ahead of estimates.US stocks sold off on Monday following six consecutive weekly gains.At midday, the S&P 500 declined 1.1 per cent to 2,075.95, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1 per cent to 17,719.88 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 5,091.76.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
49;JWN;Nordstrom;2015-10-02T17:04:19Z;Slower revenue fall boosts Macau casinos;Possible government aid for the region’s economy also helps;Shares of Macau casino operators jumped on Friday as the decline in gaming revenues slowed in September and on reports that the Chinese government was considering measures to support the region’s economy.Gross gaming revenue fell 33 per cent in September from the previous year to 17.1bn patacas ($2.1bn), according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.That figure compared with a 35.5 per cent drop reported in August and was much lower than the 49 per cent drop recorded in February.Local media reports that the Chinese government would support Macau’s growth “in all aspects” also gave casino stocks a shot in the arm.The crackdown on corruption and the economic slowdown in China has weighed on casino operators in Macau, with gaming revenues declining for 16 months straight, although the rate of decline has slowed over the past seven months.Junket operators, who lend to high-stakes Chinese VIP gamblers, also took a hit last month on reports that an employee had stolen investor capital from junket operator Dore Entertainment.Kenneth Fong, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said junkets reserved more capital to brace for withdrawals following the Dore incident, which “led to a temporary slowdown in revenue in the middle of September as system liquidity tightened”. However, the junket operators have said “liquidity has since then stabilised”. They added that they are “cautiously optimistic on mass traffic” ahead of the important Golden Week holiday in China.Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 with shares up 23 per cent to $63.47. Shares in Las Vegas Sands advanced more than 10 per cent to $40.87, shares in Melco Crown Entertainment gained 14 per cent to $15.51 and MGM Resorts International shares climbed 6 per cent to $19.79.Nordstrom announced a special cash dividend of $4.85 a share and an additional $1bn share buyback programme after the market closed on Thursday. The news pushed shares of the luxury goods retailer 5 per cent higher to $75.08.Micron Technology shares climbed 8 per cent to $15.91 after the chipmaker reported better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and said the outlook for memory chips looked favourable in the long term.Profits fell 59 per cent from a year ago to $471m or 42 cents a share, but well ahead of analysts’ expectations for earnings of 29 cents a share. Sales declined 15 per cent to $3.6bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.Favourable supply dynamics for its memory chip along with “Micron’s technology progress, and emergence of new categories of demand with smartwatch[es] and car[s], would allow Micron to grow its revenues and earnings faster than its peer group of tech companies over the next 12 to 18 months”, Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst at Jefferies said.Shares in Gilead Sciences slid as much as 2.4 per cent to $95.99 after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and maintained their $127 price target. Valeant Pharmaceuticals shares also fell 2 per cent after Morgan Stanley analysts cut their rating on the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and lowered their target price to $200 from $284. Valeant rebounded to close 1.6 per cent higher on the day.US stocks sold off after the latest report from the labour department showed the economy created 142,000 jobs in September and downwardly revised August’s figures.By end of day, however, the main indices had pared their losses. The S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 1,951.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 16,472.37, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.7 per cent at 4,707.77.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
50;JWN;Nordstrom;2015-08-14T17:18:01Z;Department stores prosper on sales boost;US stocks lack direction as consumer confidence slide offsets positive industrial production data;US retailers climbed on Friday as two stalwart department stores reported better than expected results, tempering concerns that consumer spending remains downtrodden.Shares of Nordstrom, the luxury goods retailer, were up 4.3 per cent to $78.13 after it lifted full-year sales and gross profit forecasts as revenues across its three main divisions rose.Nordstrom, which sells $99 slippers and $5,495 floral jacquard dresses, said it expected same-store sales, an important industry metric, to climb between 3.5 and 4.5 per cent for the full year, lifting overall net sales as much as 9.5 per cent.The outlook was rosier than similar projections in May when the company projected sales growth of as much as 9 per cent on a 2-4 per cent rise in same-store sales.Nordstrom lifted its full-year earnings forecast to between $3.85 and $3.95, ahead of analyst forecasts for $3.75 a share.Analysts at JPMorgan said the retailer was “pulling away from the pack” as it invested in its underlying business, while those with Cowen & Company expected it to outperform peers as its expansion to Canada, acquisition of Trunk Club and growth of its off-price website buoyed revenues.“The second-quarter strength with young customers — fastest growing categories — demonstrates Nordstrom is future-proofing its business to attract the millennial customer base,” said Oliver Chen at Cowen.JC Penney, the Texas department store chain in the middle of a turnround, said its restructuring efforts had gained momentum in the second quarter, bucking the trend of lacklustre same-store sales growth.A 4.1 per cent jump in like-for-like sales for the period beat expectations for a 3.9 per cent rise.Menswear, home, Sephora cosmetics and fine jewellery categories were its top performing merchandise divisions for the quarter.The department store said net sales had advanced 3 per cent to $2.9bn, while its loss narrowed to $138m, or 45 cents a share.JC Penney shares rose 5.5 per cent to $8.52, while shares in rival department store Dillard’s remained little changed.Several retailers and apparel manufacturers climbed following the two sets of results. Coach advanced 1.5 per cent to $31.93, PVH gained 2.5 per cent to $114.52 and Hanesbrands rose 1.8 per cent to $30.32. Michael Kors, however, decreased 0.6 per cent to $43.37.Kinder Morgan gained 2.5 per cent to $33.96 after analysts with Goldman Sachs added the energy company to its “conviction list”.Dupont, the maker of animal feed and crop protection, rose 1.6 per cent to $53.86 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”, citing its more than 20 per cent year-to-date decline.Restaurant chain El Pollo Loco declined 20.7 per cent to $14.56 after it dimmed its full-year sales growth forecasts.Overall, US equity markets rolled sideways as better industrial production figures than expected were offset by a slide in consumer confidence.The S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,091.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4 per cent to 17,477.40, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.3 per cent to 5,048.23.eric.platt@ft.comtwitter: @ericgplatt
51;JWN;Nordstrom;2015-05-27T17:22:10Z;Michael Kors plunges on sales outlook;Shares hit as decade of growth in same-store figures comes to an end;Michael Kors shares fell as much as 24 per cent on Wednesday, after the luxury retailer warned that same-store sales growth would be flat this year, ending nearly a decade of gains, with earnings expected to fall short of expectations.The New York-based company said comparable store sales growth, a key industry metric, would be short of Wall Street expectations for a 6.9 per cent rise and a sharp drop from the 10.3 per cent increase recorded in the yearFull-year total sales are expected to range between $4.7bn and $4.8bn, assuming a $200m hit from currency swings, with earnings ranging from $4.40 to $4.50 a share. Analysts had projected Michael Kors would earn $4.68 a share on sales of $5.1bn.The outlook accompanied fourth-quarter results that showed a 13.4 per cent jump in profits from a year earlier to $182.6m. Sales climbed 17.8 per cent to $1.1bn, roughly in line with consensus expectations.John Idol, chairman and chief executive, said the fourth quarter was hampered by weak traffic trends in North America, a drop in sales of watches and an impact from delays associated with issues at ports along the US West Coast.“While we were faced with a number of headwinds in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with the strong performance across our segments and geographies,” Mr Idol said.Sales in the quarter were buoyed by the opening of 121 net new stores over the past year, offsetting weakness in same-store sales. Michael Kors also reported strong gains in its ecommerce operations, echoing a shift in consumer trends already articulated by department stores including Nordstrom and Macy’s and a key point underlying the merger between Yoox and Net-a-Porter, the online luxury goods retailers.Revenues from the company’s digital business climbed 63 per cent in the year that ended in March from the previous period, aided by the launch of a new online website in the US. The company said its expenses in the current year would rise as it expands its ecommerce business abroad.JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight following the results, noting that the company’s outlook was “materially worse” than expected. Nomura added that despite the decline in the share price, investors would probably “need to see signs” of a trough in same-store sales before investing.Shares of the company slid more than a fifth to $46.90, taking their declines to more than 50 per cent since they touched a high of $101.04 in February 2014.Peers across the luxury goods space slid after the earnings report, with shares of Coach falling 5 per cent to $34.68, Vera Bradley declining 4 per cent to $13.48, and Fossil sliding 7 per cent to $70.55.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

Adjusted earnings of 17 cents a share topped forecasts for 12 cents.Newmont has been working to lower costs, as gold prices have fallen more than 35 per cent since a June 2011 peak. Its shares, which have advanced 37 per cent this year, climbed 4.58 per cent on Friday to close at $25.58.Deere underperformed the S&P 500, after it lowered full-year sales forecasts as lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes weighed on demand.The agricultural equipment maker, which is based in Moline, Illinois, said sales for fiscal 2015 would be 17 per cent lower than the previous year. In late November it had projected a 15 per cent drop. Profits are expected to be $1.8bn, just shy of the earlier forecast of $1.9bn.Sales declined for the fourth straight quarter, down 17 per cent to $5.6bn in the three months ended in January. Fiscal first-quarter profits fell to $387m, or $1.12 a share, compared with $681m, or $1.81 a share, in the period a year ago.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 84 cents a share on sales of $5.5bn. “Deere’s first-quarter performance reflected sluggish conditions in the global farm sector, which reduced demand for agricultural machinery, particularly larger models, and led to lower sales and income,” said Samuel Allen, chief executive.Deere shares nudged up to close at $92.43.Luxury department store chain Nordstrom advanced nearly 6 per cent to $81.74, after it said it would increase its capital expenditure plans nearly 60 per cent in 2015 as it attempts to capture consumer spending.The Seattle-based company said it would spend $1.2bn in the year to next January 31 to open more stores. The news came alongside fourth-quarter earnings that fell 5 per cent to $255m, or $1.32 a share, and missed analyst forecasts. Sales rose 9 per cent to $4.04bn, ahead of estimates.Intuit, the company behind TurboTax and QuickBooksOnline, led the S&P 500, climbing 6.16 per cent to $96.72, as it reported growth in its online subscriber base.

54;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Target axes struggling Canadian business;;Target abandoned its struggling Canadian business on Thursday after failing to turn around its operations, putting more than 17,000 jobs at risk and wiping out the company’s full-year profit with a $5.4bn writedown.The US retailer, celebrated for bringing fashionable offerings to middle and low income consumers, failed to connect with Canadian tastes and executives feared that the four-year-old venture would fail to reach profitability for another six years.Target, which operates 133 stores in Canada and employs 17,600 people, filed an “application for protection” under Canadian law as it liquidates the business.The company could record loss of more than $2.2bn for the year ending January 31, according to the latest Wall Street estimates, after taking a writedown of about $5.4bn in the fourth quarter.Cash costs to discontinue the Canadian business could reach as high as $600m and are likely to take place in the company’s upcoming fiscal year.Brain Cornell, who took the reins of America’s second-largest discount retailer last year, said that the company could not find a “realistic scenario” in which its Canadian operations would be profitable until at least 2021.“Of all the options that we evaluated, there is no question that a complete exit from Canada was the most difficult,” Mr Cornell said. “After extensive internal due diligence and research, paired with counsel from outside experts, we fulfilled our obligation to do what was right for our company and our shareholders.”The US retailer’s expansion into Canada, which began in 2011 with the first stores opening in 2013, was closely scrutinised and followed by American competitors who viewed the country as an untapped market.Nordstrom, the luxury department store chain, has opened the first of six stores, with plans to bring its low-cost Rack division in the coming years.Empire builders often fail to understand facts on the groundContinue readingTarget said it would set aside roughly $59m, pending court approval, for an employee trust that would provide nearly all of the unit’s staff members with 16 weeks’ pay.Jason Kenney, minister of employment and social development in Canada, said the government would “work as quickly as possible” to provide assistance to those retrenched.The Canadian arm, which was called a “mess” by some analysts, drew criticism from the start as Target opened stores rapidly but stocked shelves with merchandise that was met with antipathy from local customers.Target also drew ire for its prices in Canada, which were higher than those found in the US.Mr Cornell, who joined from PepsiCo, insisted that the exit was the “right decision for the company.” A cyber hack in late 2013 that exposed the details of millions of customers followed by lacklustre performance in the US sharpened the pressure on Mr Cornell.Wells Fargo said the move was “an indication of Cornell’s leadership style, that there are no ‘sacred cows’.” David Schick, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, noted Target could now return more capital to shareholders and invest in its digital operations.“This allows Target to refocus on the US and, over time, buy incrementally more stock back while reinvesting in the business transformation,” Mr Schick said.Shares in Target climbed 3 per cent to $77.50, nearing an all-time high reached earlier this month, after the company also said sales in the US eclipsed its expectations over the holiday period and that its adjusted fourth-quarter earnings would be about 6 cents higher than projected.eric.platt@ft.com@ericgplatt
55;JWN;Nordstrom;2014-11-14T17:45:06Z;Nordstrom up after overcoming warm weather;US stocks modestly negative despite upbeat economic data;Nordstrom was one of the best-performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 after the high-end retailer reported better than expected third-quarter results.Nordstrom said same-store sales, a closely watched measure for retailers, eclipsed Wall Street expectations despite a warm autumn. Same-store sales rose 3.9 per cent ahead of forecasts for a 3.3 per cent rise.Retailers such as Macy’s, which owns luxury department store Bloomingdale’s, and JC Penney blamed warmer weather in the third quarter for lacklustre results as consumers waited to purchase coats and outerwear stocked for the autumn.Nordstrom said profits increased 4 per cent from a year earlier to $142m, or 73 cents a share, in the three months to November 1.The quarter included a $9m accounting charge related to the acquisition of Trunk Club, a personalised clothing service for men.Sales climbed 9 per cent to $3.14bn. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 71 cents a share on sales of $3.1bn.Nordstrom said it expected full-year same store sales to rise 3.5 per cent, at the midpoint of its previous forecast.The retailer lowered its full-year earnings guidance to $3.70-$3.75 a share compared with a projection for $3.80-$3.90 a share earlier.“In our view, Nordstrom remains one of the only true growth stories in traditional retailing, with investments in Rack, ecommerce, and Canada positioning the company to deliver an acceleration in earnings, as revenue accelerates after several years of investments,” said Michael Exstein, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Shares of Nordstrom gained more than 1 per cent to $74.17 and are up 21 per cent so far this year.Shares of car rental company Hertz slipped 5 per cent to $21.69 after the company warned that it will have to restate its financial results for 2012 and 2013. Hertz had first disclosed accounting errors in June.Shares of the California-based airline Virgin America climbed 33 per cent to $30.70 in their debut on the Nasdaq on Friday, lifting the company’s market valuation above $1bn.Virgin America priced shares above the midpoint of its targeted range on Thursday, selling 13.3m shares at $23 apiece to raise $305m.The company also sold shares in a private placement alongside the initial public offering, taking total proceeds to $359m.Movado shares tumbled 32 per cent to $26.25 after the watchmaker warned that third-quarter profits and sales would miss forecasts.“I am disappointed in our third-quarter performance and our expectations for this trend to continue into the fourth quarter, which combined has caused us to reduce guidance for the full year,” Efraim Grinberg, chief executive, said.Movado expects earnings in the range of 86 to 87 cents a share, below estimates for $1.13. The company expects net sales of $188.6m, below expectations for $216.5m.For fiscal 2015, the company expects net sales will increase to a range of $585m to $590m, short of estimates for $634m. Earnings in the range of $1.80 to $1.85 a share were also short of estimates.US stocks were little changed despite better than expected consumer confidence and retail sales figures.The S&P 500 ended the session flat at 2,039.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 17,634.74 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 4,688.54.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
56;JWN;Nordstrom;2014-08-15T16:53:31Z;Retailers retreat as discounting hits margins;;The US retail sector weakened on Friday as discounting continued to weigh on margins of some of the country’s largest department chains, despite relative strength in the crucial back-to-school season.The week saw both Macy’s and Nordstrom report lower gross margins as each invests further in online operations, which has proven one of the few growth areas for legacy retailers.Executives with the two retailers also cited continued “promotional” activity across the industry as companies try to goad consumers back into their stores, although some commentary indicated discounting has moderated in recent months.“Each of the department stores attributed their gross margin performance to various factors: excess spring inventory, elevated promotions, mix shift, and expansion,” said Stephen Grambling, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.“In our view, promotions likely remained elevated but were more manageable as demand improved.”Nordstrom was among the hardest hit on Friday after reporting a sharp increase in inventories, primarily for its off-price Rack division, compared with same-store sales growth.“Nordstrom may face margin pressure as it adjusts its strategy in light of the highly promotional environment,” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said. “While high investment spending may be good for the long term, we expect it to continue to impede near-term results.”Shares of Nordstrom declined 5 per cent to $65.11, Macy’s fell 1 per cent to $57.45, Sears fell 2 per cent to $35.16 and Dillard’s, which also reported results, fell 8 per cent to $106.11.Shares of JC Penney, whose last two years have been scarred by a battle with activist investor Bill Ackman and the ousting of former chief executive Ron Johnson, slid after climbing 10 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday, following the broader sector lower.The initial investor enthusiasm followed quarterly results that showed same-store sales climbed 6 per cent in the quarter to August 2, ahead of consensus expectations.Overall sales advanced 5.1 per cent to $2.8bn while its loss narrowed to $172m, or 56 cents per share.Both figures topped Wall Street expectations. Since the return of former chief executive Mike Ullman in April 2013, the retailer has restored the coupons and brands that helped lure middle-income shoppers to its stores.JC Penney shares slid 2 per cent to $9.50.Coca-Cola agreed to pay $2.15bn for a 16.7 per cent stake in Monster Beverage, sending shares of the latter up 27 per cent to $90.73.Monster, whose energy drinks include Monster Energy, Monster Rehab as well as Peace Tea iced teas, has been mooted as a possible target for Coca-Cola as it seeks new sources of growth.Coca-Cola said it would transfer its worldwide energy drink business to Monster and would amend current distribution agreements to bring Monster drinks to markets outside of the US and Canada.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, said the deal would support the soft drink company’s long-term growth plans.“Coca-Cola has historically had a difficult time gaining significant traction in the energy category and with this partnership agreement, will be able to quickly gain access to one of the most attractive beverage categories in a capital efficient way,” Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Coca-Cola shares advanced 2 per cent to $40.88 while rival PepsiCo rose less than 0.1 per cent to $91.85.SeaWorld, the US theme park operator that has come under fire for its treatment of captive killer whales, advanced 4 per cent to $18.66 after it said it would build new facilities for the animals.The US company, which operates theme parks in Orlando and San Diego, will spend $10m creating new killer whale tanks.The announcement comes after SeaWorld acknowledged that the publicity generated by a documentary about its parks, Blackfish, had hit attendance. Its shares slumped 33 per cent on Wednesday.Overall, US equity markets ended flat after a day of volatile trading following reports of a military clash in Ukraine.The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged at 1,955.06 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 16,662.91.

57;JWN;Nordstrom;2014-08-13T16:09:17Z;Department stores slip on Macy’s warning;;Shares in US department store operators slipped after one of the country’s largest chains warned an improving second half would not fully compensate for weakness at the beginning of the year.Macy’s, which also owns the Bloomingdale’s luxury chain, said full year same-store sales – a key measure for retailers – would likely rise between 1.5 and 2 per cent, below initial projections as high as 3 per cent.The bitter US winter eroded first-quarter profits, increasing the importance of the so-called ‘back to school’ shopping period for both Macy’s and its rivals.Terry Lundgren, Macy’s chief executive, said the retailer was approaching the second half with optimism “tempered with the reality that many customers still are not feeling comfortable about spending more in an uncertain economic environment”.Overall revenues for the quarter ended August 2 climbed 3 per cent from a year earlier to $6.2bn. Profits edged 4 per cent higher to $292m, or 80 cents per share. Both figures were shy of analyst estimates.The results coincided with monthly retail sales figures from the Department of Commerce, which fell short of Wall Street expectations.The figures showed virtually no change in overall sales in July from a month earlier but a 0.7 per cent decline in sales at department stores.Analysts with Wells Fargo noted Macy’s had the poor fortune of being the first mall-based retailer to report quarterly results.“Once all have reported, we don’t think Macy’s will seem so bad,” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said. “After all, gross profit dollars increased showing that the company is at least driving sales with its promotions. Not all will be so fortunate.”Macy’s shares slumped 5 per cent to $56.50. Rival Nordstrom declined 1 per cent to $68.06, Sears fell 2 per cent to $35.89, Kohl’s declined 2 per cent to $54.94 and JC Penney slipped 2 per cent to $9.32.Yahoo shares climbed after Alibaba amended an agreement with the parent company of Alipay, the online payment processor it spun off three years ago, that capped the amount of money it could have earned in an initial public offering or other “liquidity event”.In a filing with US securities regulators, Alibaba said it would now receive at least $9.38bn in a liquidity event – representing its stake in Alipay’s parent, Small and Micro Financial Services Company. Alibaba was previously set to receive between $2bn-$6bn.Yahoo, which holds a 22.5 per cent stake in Alibaba, rose 2 per cent to $36.20.Shares in King Digital Entertainment, the UK gaming company, tumbled 23 per cent to $14.00 after it warned that the money players are spending on its flagship game, Candy Crush Saga, has moderated.As a result, King, which was valued at $7bn in its March initial public offering, cut its forecast for gross bookings to between $2.25bn and $2.35bn for the full-year.American Apparel shares slipped 5 per cent to $0.86 after the struggling retailer said sales stalled in the three months to the end of June.The Los Angeles-based company said its loss narrowed to $15m, or 9 cents per share, from $38m a year earlier. Analysts on Wall Street had expected a loss of 6 cents per share in the period.The company said it would also delay filing its quarterly report with US securities regulators to give new board members time to review its financials.Fossil Group, which makes watches for Burberry, Michael Kors and Emporio Armani, along with its own namesake brand, was under pressure after the company said operating margins declined as sales growth fell to its slowest pace since 2012.Second-quarter profits slid 22 per cent to $52.5, or 98 cents per share, as the company continued to invest in new stores.Sales climbed 9.6 per cent to $774m. Analysts had expected profits of $50.5m from sales of $771m.The figures are unlikely to allay concern as competitors prepare to unleash their own smart watches.Apple has marshalled the most attention for its possible entry into the watch market. Morgan Stanley estimates Apple will sell between 30m and 60m watches, generating sales of $9bn in its first year.Shares of Fossil slipped 6 per cent to $96.50.Overall, US equity markets firmed despite softer economic data. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,946.72 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 16,651.80.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1 per cent to 4,434.13.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
58;JWN;Nordstrom;2014-06-23T21:32:54Z;BlackBerry rises on ‘meaningful progress’;;BlackBerry shares rose above $10 apiece for the first time since March after brokerage Evercore lifted its view as the company makes “meaningful progress” on its turnround.Analysts with Evercore increased their rating on the company to equal-weight from underweight, marking the first time in at least two years that three-quarters of investment banks have rated BlackBerry a buy or hold equivalent.The smartphone maker, which has turned its focus to software and its BlackBerry Messenger service, said last week that it had swung to a profit in the three months to the end of May compared with a loss a quarter earlier.“We stick to our call that we like BlackBerry’s plan, albeit late, but now acknowledge stabilising cash burn . . . and a good plan to hold on to the core subscriber base,” Mark McKechnie said.Mr McKechnie projects the company will grow BlackBerry Messenger to a $230m business and continue to win back corporate subscribers who had switched to other platforms including Good, which recently filed paperwork to float shares publicly.BlackBerry shares climbed 3.24 per cent to close at $10.85.Shares of Micros Systems rose 3.36 per cent to $67.98 after Oracle agreed to buy the company, which sells internet-based cash registers to retailers, for $4.6bn in cash.Micros investors will receive $68 a share, according to the terms of the deal.Like other, older, software makers, Oracle is having to rapidly adapt to an era of so-called cloud computing, in which customers receive software online and pay for it as they use it rather than on an annual licence model.Oracle shares rose 0.69 per cent to $41.10.The merger blitz on Monday was not left solely to the tech industry after Wisconsin Energy agreed to buy rival Integrys Energy for $9.1bn in cash, shares and assumed debt.The deal expands Wisconsin’s customer base – for both gas and electricity – into Minnesota and Michigan.Combined, the company will have about 4.3m customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.Gale Klappa, chief executive of Wisconsin, will run the combined company and insisted on Monday that the acquisition would “create the premier regulated utility system in the Midwest”.The companies said the acquisition valued Integrys at $71.47 a share.Wisconsin, whose history dates back to the late 19th century, said the dividend of the combined company would be about 65 to 70 per cent of its earnings.Shares of Integrys rose 12.14 per cent to $68.35 while Wisconsin fell 3.45 per cent to $45.27.Lululemon advanced as speculation rose that the company’s founder could mount a bid to take the Yoga-apparel maker private.According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Dennis Wilson is working with Goldman Sachs as he debates launching a proxy fight for extra board seats.Mr Wilson may also partner with a private equity firm to purchase Lululemon outright.Shares in the Vancouver-based retailer rose 2.54 per cent to $41.25.Nordstrom was under pressure on Monday after broker Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the department store chain to neutral from buy.The investment bank, which expects overall discretionary spending to accelerate after the harsh winter, believes Nordstrom shares have outperformed and have little upside left.Nordstrom shares fell 0.53 per cent to $67.73.US equity markets ended the day flat after six consecutive advances despite better than expected manufacturing and home sales reports.The S&P 500 fell 0.01 per cent to 1,962.61 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.06 per cent to 16,937.26.

59;JWN;Nordstrom;2014-05-16T21:47:14Z;Department stores surge amid spring recovery;;Shares in Nordstrom and JC Penney, department store groups operating at opposite ends of the spectrum, surged after both reported better than expected earnings amid a spring recovery that has encouraged several retail executives over their second-quarter prospects.Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer that competes with Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale’s, said revenue growth had accelerated in the first quarter, driven by sales of cosmetics, shoes and women’s handbags, as well as by the company’s outlet business.Executives also said the company retained Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities to advise it on the potential sale of $2bn of credit card receivables, providing the motivation for an upgrade to ‘outperform’ from ‘neutral’ at Credit Suisse.“Last night’s announcement that Nordstrom would be putting its $2bn credit card receivables portfolio up for sale appears to be a bridge to the likely earnings acceleration in 2016,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Exstein said.For the quarter, net sales rose 7 per cent to $2.9bn while profits fell 3 per cent to $140m, or 72 cents per share. Its shares surged 14.73 per cent to close at a record high of $70.55.JC Penney was buoyed by the return of its customer base, lifting same-store sales 6.2 per cent in the quarter to May 3, comfortably ahead of forecasts. Overall, sales climbed to $2.8bn from $2.6bn, JC Penney said on Thursday.Parachuted back into the retailer in early 2013 after the troubled tenure of former Apple executive Ron Johnson, chief executive Mike Ullman has sought to revive sales by restoring the discounts and brands that lured middle-income shoppers.The second straight quarter of rising same-store sales overshadowed the loss that JC Penney reported for the period.The company also said it had increased its lending facility to $2.35bn, helping to alleviate some liquidity concerns.The company’s shares climbed 16.25 per cent to $9.73. Peer Macy’s rose 1.77 per cent to $58.07 while Hudson’s Bay was up 0.97 per cent at C$17.62.Shares in Darden, the US restaurant operator, fell 4.34 per cent to $48.49 after it said it had sold its Red Lobster seafood chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital for $2.1bn in cash.Activist shareholders, including Barrington Capital, had pushed Darden, which also owns the Olive Garden chain, to squeeze more value from its property portfolio.Darden said about $1bn of the cash from the sale would be used to pay off debt, with $500m to $600m going towards share buybacks.World Wrestling Entertainment shares tumbled by the most since its public offering after it said new subscribers to its online service would fail to offset lost pay-per-view and on-demand operating income until 2015.The company said it would need 1.3m to 1.4m subscribers to its online network to completely offset cannibalisation of its other businesses. Shares in WWE declined 43.45 per cent to $11.27 by the close.Rackspace, the cloud computing company, jumped by nearly a fifth on Friday after it disclosed with US securities regulators that it had hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic proposals that it had received.“Rackspace has been approached by multiple parties who have expressed interest in exploring a strategic relationship with Rackspace, ranging from partnership to acquisition,” the company said in a statement.Its shares climbed 17.73 per cent to $36.12, elevating the company’s market capitalisation above $5bn.Overall, US equities nudged up after two days of declines as stronger than anticipated housing starts in April were followed by an unexpected fall in consumer sentiment.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.37 per cent to 1,877.86 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.27 per cent higher to 16,491.31.

60;JWN;Nordstrom;2014-02-24T12:35:43Z;US retailers smarten up the shopping experience;;"As you jostle through US department store crowds in search of a pair of shoes, a buzzing smartphone alerts you to potential options in one of your favourite colours. Shopper tracker beacons, which talk to your mobile device via bluetooth, know when you are standing near a shoe stand and prompt retailers to send messages based on your personal preferences.Macy’s, American Eagle Outfitters and other companies are already piloting such initiatives in an effort to enhance the in-store experience for customers and lift sales amid a rapidly changing retail landscape.Welcome messages and discount notifications as consumers roam are growing in prevalence, while apps have been introduced that allow shoppers to scan items as they browse – to skip long queues at cash registers.In recent years, traditional US brick and mortar retailers have boosted their online presence in an attempt to keep up with web-based rivals such as Amazon. But recent research shows that physical stores remain more important than ever as shoppers search for a seamless shopping experience on and offline.As Macy’s, Target and Best Buy, among others, release their quarterly earnings statements this week, analysts will be watching out for signs of which companies are able to shuttle customers back and forth between their platforms and increase sales and profits without losing to online rivals. Retailers are already under pressure after months of heavy discounting and promotions over a weaker than expected holiday period.Companies must continue to invest in their physical stores in tandem with innovative digital offerings, said Renato Scaff, managing director of Accenture’s retail practice. “Consumers like what they’re now getting online and mobile and have new expectations of their in-store experience,” he said.In common with technology companies that accumulate personal data, retailers face privacy questions, particularly in light of recent cyber security failures at Target and Neiman Marcus. Also, while a customer may opt in, when do such services become intrusive or bothersome?Some 21 per cent of US shoppers plan to increase their in-store purchases this year, from 9 per cent in 2013, according to an Accenture survey published this month. Close to 90 per cent of people surveyed said they would travel to a store as well as buy online if retailers offered real-time product availability.Bill Martin, president at research group ShopperTrak, said retailers had to spend as much time focusing on their physical stores, where more than 90 per cent of all commerce continues to take place.Industry watchers say the most successful companies will most likely be the retailers with the most savvy “omnichannel” operations: those that gather personal data on exactly which products a customer wants, understands when and how they might want to purchase it and have the ability to deliver the same services online, in-store or via mobile flawlessly.Roughly the same number of people said they bought in-store after browsing online (78 per cent) as those who bought online after browsing in-store (72 per cent), said Accenture.Those people who shop through multiple channels are these retailers’ most valuable customersCoupons and loyalty programmes that shift shoppers between stores and their corresponding websites have been popular as have store apps that can leverage push notifications and personalised pricing. Tablet-laden sales assistants that can sell products from the shop floor and smartphone technology for customers to track store inventory are being used more by retailers.“We are always on the lookout for how much online sales are camouflaging store erosion or who is not maximising their online opportunities,” said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel. “Those people who shop through multiple channels are these retailers’ most valuable customers, so companies have to be able to provide these numerous selling options.”Nordstrom stores have free WiFi to enable customers to make purchases online from the store if items are out of stock; Macy’s and Urban Outfitters have moved towards store-based completion of online purchases; while Best Buy and Sears have created in-store pick-up options for web-based sales.Indicative of a mindset change, Macy’s said in December it would stop recording sales by purchase platforms, as part of an effort to close the gap between store, desktop and mobile.But as traditional retailers continue to jostle within an already overcrowded marketplace, online competitors are not standing still. Amazon and eBay have both recently introduced plans for one-hour delivery.“While Macy’s, Urban Outfitters and Gap are doing well, others such as Nordstrom, which has a robust and technologically-advanced ecommerce experience in and out of store, has trouble growing store sales even as online sales are going gangbusters,” said Mr Jaffe.Consumer electronics retailers in particular, he said, are under pressure. “No one can guarantee what exactly is going to work.”"
61;JWN;Nordstrom;2012-10-04T17:57:56Z;US retail sales growth slows;;US retail sales growth slowed in September but was in line with expectations against the backdrop of uncertainty over the economic recovery and the presidential election, writes Barney Jopson in New York.Like-for-like sales rose 3.6 per cent from a year ago in September at 17 retailers that report monthly figures, according to Thomson Reuters, after a 6.1 per cent rise in sales during back to school shopping in August.“It’s not hot, it’s not not, it’s just ‘meh’,” said Barbara Kahn, marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, as economic data continues to send mixed signals to consumers. Gap, Costco and the TJX Companies narrowly beat expectations with gains in like-for-like sales of 6 per cent each. Department stores had a relatively weak month as Nordstrom and Macy’s posted smaller gains that fell slightly short of expectations. At Kohl’s, another department store, sales fell 2.7 per cent.The figures indicated the sector was on course for a “decent” but not spectacular end-of-year shopping season, Ms Kahn said, but she added that the impact of the November 6 presidential election was a wild card.“From a consumer point of view you may have very strong expectations and if your candidate wins maybe you’ll be jubilant and it’ll be reflected in higher shopping,” she said. “If your candidate loses maybe you’ll think the country will go into a tailspin and you’ll be pessimistic.”Joel Bines, a consultant at AlixPartners, said retailers were likely to start their end of year marketing blitz later than normal because of the election and the associated heavy spending on political advertising. “With media prices being what they are and the general distraction of the nation, retailers are being prudent about their marketing dollars. They’re saying ‘Let’s just wait till November 7’,” he said.Discounts and promotions are expected to be abundant this year as retailers battle for market share, promising a concentrated blizzard of activity. Mr Bines said consumers had held back in September after a splurge of back-to-school spending.Target, a mass market discounter, posted a 2.1 per cent gain in sales. Rises in house prices and the stock market are lifting consumer sentiment, as is the Federal Reserve’s attempt to stimulate the economy by loosening monetary policy.On the negative side are higher gas prices and worries about the jobs market, the US budget deficit and eurozone crisis.
62;JWN;Nordstrom;2012-01-12T23:15:14Z;Target seeks to refocus its image;;"Target, the US discounter that brought cheap chic to big box retail, is to open 25 mini Apple stores within its own shops as sector analysts say it is facing an identity crisis.The retailer won the faux French pronunciation Tar-zhay from admirers by selling designer clothing and funky housewares at low prices. But by diversifying more recently into fresh food and pharmacies, it has diluted its brand in the eyes of some experts.Ed Little, a retail marketing specialist, said: “They’ve been a leading innovator for so long. But the general feeling in the marketing world is they’re going through an identity crisis, really trying to figure out who they want to be.”At its root lies a tension between two different ways of pulling people through its doors. One is to become a one-stop-shop where customers can buy everything, including bananas and ibuprofen; the other is to be a beacon of style not available anywhere else.“All the emphasis they put now into food is a diversion from the hip, trendy, design-focused brand personality that they worked so hard to develop,” said Mr Little, who previously worked at Nordstrom, Macy’s and J Crew.Target on Thursday signalled an effort to regain the edge once encapsulated by its “design for all” slogan. It confirmed the partnership with Apple and announced that five small boutiques – selling products as diverse as antique-style dishes and dog food – would spearhead its launch of stores-within-stores in May.Mr Little said: “I think it is a step in the right direction for Target to differentiate and innovate, distancing themselves from the mass marketers of commodities.” Target did not provide further details about the mini Apple stores.The announcement comes during a period of upheaval. Target reported a disappointing 1.6 per cent rise in December sales. Last week, it ended its six-year partnership with Wieden + Kennedy, its lead advertising agency. It is still without a chief marketing officer after Michael Francis left last October to join JC Penney.Asked how food and drugs could sit under the same brand as Apple iPads and Missoni’s Italian handbags, Stacia Andersen of Target’s home division said: “Our guests expect to be able to find a wide variety of things. So, while we have food and pharmacy, and that meets their everyday needs, our job is really to delight and surprise them with new things.”While a Target spokeswoman said the end of its work with Wieden + Kennedy was not linked to any one thing, she said: “We’re looking at 2012 to provide a fresh, innovative look.” Target also announced a $5bn share buy-back plan on Thursday.Until last year, Apple’s retail division was run by Ron Johnson, a former Target executive who is now chief executive of JC PenneyWith its mix of clothes and home goods, electronics and music, food and drugs, Target’s competitors range from department stores (which have mimicked its design partnerships) and Best Buy, the electronics chain, to Amazon, the online retailer, and Walmart, the behemoth of discounting.Some analysts said Target’s holiday sales fell short of expectations because it lost customers to Walmart as the world’s biggest retailer by sales moved aggressively to cut its prices amid intense competition.Target’s sale of designer products began with architect Michael Graves in 1999 and since then it has worked with a variety of partners, including Liberty of London and Rodarte, a US fashion label.Its five boutique-in-a-store partners – Privet House, Cos Bar, The Webster, Polka Dog Bakery and The Candy Store – currently run no more than a handful of stores each. Target’s ambitious plan, which it will fund itself, is to give them a place in each of its 1,700-odd stores, but only for six weeks. They will then be replaced by other boutiques.Walter Loeb, a veteran retail consultant, agreed that Target was struggling to define itself and praised the Apple initiative.“Apple stores will attract young customers and that’s the challenge for all retailers today,” he said. “Young customers love to shop in speciality stores and in stores that are convenient. They don’t spend a lot of time in malls and stores where older people go.”"
63;JWN;Nordstrom;2011-12-01T18:44:48Z;Winners and losers in Black Friday sales;;Strong shopping traffic over the Black Friday holiday weekend failed to provide a boost to all retailers, with November sales figures revealing a clear separation of winners and losers.Like-for-like sales across the sector increased by 3.2 per cent in November from a year ago, but some retailers reported declines, according to Retail Metrics, a research group. Bargain-hunting shoppers in the days after Thanksgiving account for between 20 and 30 per cent of most retailers’ November revenue.In spite of a strong Black Friday, shares in Barnes & Noble, the book retailer, plunged by 16 per cent on Thursday after its latest quarterly results revealed slowing revenue growth and a bigger-than-expected loss as it invests in its digital business to take on Amazon and Apple.Among department stores, Macy’s reported a 4.8 per cent rise in sales in November thanks partly to the buzz generated by its decision to open at midnight on the cusp of Black Friday. But sales at JC Penney, which stuck to a 4am opening, fell 2 per cent.No clear recipe for success emerged. Kohl’s, which also opened at midnight, reported a 6.2 per cent fall in sales, while sales at Nordstrom, which kept to normal openings hours and did not offer big discounts, grew by 5.6 per cent.“You still have the consumer dichotomy,” said Joel Bines of consultancy Alix Partners, referring to shoppers who split their spending between high-end luxuries and cut-price basics. “And within each retail segment you are seeing a separation of the winners and the losers.”Barnes & Noble said its sales grew by 11 per cent over the Black Friday weekend, compared with retail-wide growth estimates that ranged from 9 to 16 per cent.But investors were unnerved by a sharp slowdown in sales growth for its Nook e-reader business in the three months to October 29 – which preceded the November launch of its own tablet computer – as total sales slipped 0.6 per cent to $1.89bn.Barnes & Noble shares were down 16 per cent at $14.62 at midday in New York after Standard & Poors lowered its rating on the company to sell and other analysts said they were reviewing their sales and profit estimates.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said that the November sales figures for the sector suggested “a good, but not great, start to the holiday shopping season”.Gap, the clothing retailer, reported another weak performance in November as it struggles to revive its business, with like-for-like sales at Gap-branded stores in North America falling 2 per cent and the group’s international sales down 9 per cent.Megan Donadio, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consultancy, said: “The companies that have had negative [sales] have lost touch with their target consumer. They’re clearly not able to give consumers what they want.”
64;JWN;Nordstrom;2011-10-12T03:19:03Z;Franklin leads fall in US money manager stocks;;US money manager stocks fell on Tuesday after Franklin Resources, parent of Franklin Templeton Investments, revealed an unexpected decline in fixed income assets under management during September.Overall assets under management at Franklin Resources fell from $716.4bn at the end of August to $659.9bn at the end of September – principally due to falling asset prices, with Barclays Capital estimating investor outflows from equity funds were only $2.4bn and outflows from fixed income funds less than $1bn.Equity withdrawals had been expected, but the fall in fixed income assets under management from $314.6bn to $297.7bn worried some analysts.“We had previously factored in a much lower growth rate in global fixed income [but] now we expect negative flows [in the last quarter of 2011],” Chris Spahr, an analyst at CLSA wrote to clients. Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62.

65;JWN;Nordstrom;2011-08-12T20:54:54Z;US stocks end week on a high note;;US stocks ended an historically volatile week on a high note, paring their losses from Monday’s session, which saw the biggest one-day drop in share prices since 2008.In focus on Friday were retail groups, which gained initially on strong earnings and macroeconomic data. But those gains were cut when the University of Michigan consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly sharply, to its lowest in three decades.Nordstrom, which was up as much as 7 per cent at the opening bell, was up 4.6 per cent to $44.27 at midday on Friday. The high-end goods retailer topped earnings forecasts and brought its full-year profits projection back to where it began the year, after lowering it earlier. Polo Ralph Lauren, which reported strong earnings earlier this week, was up 5.5 per cent on Friday to $137.70.Kohl’s, the department store chain, also beat forecasts and opened higher, jumping 5 per cent. However, executives said they “weren’t happy” with their sales, and the stock ended just 0.1 per cent higher on Friday, at $47.54.It was reported on Friday that US headline retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, while June’s increase was revised from 0.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent, with notable improvements in electronics goods sales that do not simply reflect rising gas and food prices.“The consumer is at the centre of the weak economy debate,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. “Even a modestly better than expected number provides us with some level of relief.”By the closing bell on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,178.80, with industrials and consumer groups advancing, but financials declining.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent higher at 11,269.40, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to 2,507.98.The S&P 500, despite extraordinary volatility– the index moved 50 points each session from Monday to Thursday for the first time – lost just 1.8 per cent this week, and the Dow just 1.6 per cent.That pales in comparison with last week’s S&P decline of more than 7 per cent, the market’s worst five days in two years. The index is down 6.3 per cent on the year.But buyers began to emerge as the week wore on. Factors in their favour included resistance to falling below 1,100 points on the S&P 500 index, as well as some timely and unexpected economic data, such as a fall in jobless claims.There were also tempting bargains such as Apple, which at one point fell into “correction” territory, down more than 10 per cent from the year’s peak price. Apple was up 0.9 per cent on the week to $376.99. The biggest gainer on the week, MEMC Electronic Materials, maker of solar panel wafers, was rebounding from its lowest price since the dotcom bust in 2002. It added 17.8 per cent to $6.53.Financial groups were the worst performers of the week, haunted by concerns ranging from a slowing economy to spillover effects from European bank troubles and the impact of near-zero yields on their deposits. The KBW Banks index fell 8.9 per cent on the week, adding to its 10 per cent decline the previous week.Bank of America, fell 12 per cent over the week, bouncing back somewhat from a 20 per cent drop on Monday. It was the worst performer in the Dow, however, and was trading at $7.19 on Friday – below the $8 level for the first time since early 2009.Citigroup fell 10.7 per cent on the week, to $29.85. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were among the better performers, with analysts citing them as potentially better able to weather the storm, falling 4.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively.Despite the rout, analysts continued to recommend that investors buy or hold their shares. “We struggle to find the source of another US banking crisis: liquidity is high, capital is high and changes in asset prices are more subdued,” said Brian Foran at Nomura.“The big risk, we believe, is re-rating for limited growth and low rates,” he added, terming it “the ‘Japan-isation’ of US banks.”Stocks that offered dividend yields higher than Treasuries did well on the week. Mortgage-buying real estate investment trusts, which return their cash flows directly to investors, were up for the week. Annaly Capital Management added 2 per cent to $17.88, and Capstead Mortgage rose 5.6 per cent to $12.90.Materials was the only sector to rise this week, up 0.2 per cent, amid expectations that it would benefit from higher commodity prices – which many believe the Fed’s low rates could bring. CF Industries, the fertiliser group, added 14.7 per cent to $168.20 on the week. Newmont Mining, the gold miner, added 5.6 per cent to $57.44.News Corp, the media group headed by Rupert Murdoch, jumped 10.6 per cent on the week to $16.23, after it promised share buy-backs and Mr Murdoch said he would remain in charge. Analysts at Citigroup recommended selling the stock, citing how much it had risen.
66;JWN;Nordstrom;2011-08-02T21:02:39Z;US stocks tumble most in a year;;US stocks fell the most in a year on Tuesday, their seventh straight losing session in a row, as worries about the economy outweighed the resolution of the debt ceiling deal.The resolution of the debt ceiling deal, with the Senate’s “yes” vote and President Barack Obama’s signature, only served to unleash a wave of selling, driving the S&P 500 index down 2.6 per cent, its biggest single-day drop since August of last year. The broad index is now down 0.3 per csent for the year.“Stock market sellers had been held in check by the prospect of a debt ceiling relief rally,” said William Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “The largest effect is that it allows investors to focus more fully on the deterioration in the economic fundamentals.”Consumer discretionary and industrial groups were pacing declines, dropping 3.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.Traders were disappointed early on by earnings at Archer Daniels Midland, the food processing group, and by a poor report on consumer spending.The S&P 500 index ended the session at 1,254.05, well below its 200-day moving average of 1,284. Technical analysts said the next resistance level was 1,250, its March low.The Nasdaq Composite index was 2.8 per cent lower at 2,669.24 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.2 per cent to 11,866.62.ADM shares fell 6.2 per cent to $28.60 after it reported second-quarter earnings of 60 cents per share, missing analysts’ target of 84.8 cents.Shares in Emerson Electric, a manufacturing conglomerate, slipped 4.1 per cent to $47.06 after the company warned that orders would slow in the latter part of the year. “US and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft patch,” it said.Parker Hannifin, a manufacturer of mechanical equipment, fell 8.5 per cent to $70.88, its lowest for the year, after it warned that orders from the military and defence sector would be soft, and provided guidance for the year below what analysts were expecting.Retailers began their portion of the earnings reporting season on Tuesday with Coach, the high-end designer, seeing sharp falls after it was reported that personal spending slipped 0.2 per cent in June, below the 0.1 per cent growth expected by economists.“The data on personal income and spending suggests that the third quarter begins with no momentum from the consumer sector,” said Mr Delwiche.Coach shares were off 6.5 per cent to $61.03, down from their all-time highs of $67 reached in July.Retailers are the last major economic segment to report earnings. Many of those reporting later this week were down, including Nordstrom, down 5.8 per cent to $47.05, and Macy’s, off 5.6 per cent to $27.63. Tiffany, the jeweller, paced all declines in the S&P, falling 8.2 per cent to $73.38.The fear is that the non-farm payroll report on Friday, a key measure of consumers’ ability to spend, could be as poor as last week’s GDP figures and Monday’s industrial production survey.“If retailers report weak numbers or guidance, we could see another leg lower in the S&P index,” said David Rovelli, managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Genuity.The debt deal itself is, in part, adding to consternation as those who believe that US stimulus spending has played a crucial part in supporting markets fear that spending caps will make it nearly impossible to approve any additional government help.“We’ve been operating under the assumption for the last two years that equity investors should be bullish until the bill comes due, as democracies rarely choose deflation,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas. “But the bill has come due and we have to reduce our outlook.”Trading in consumer groups would be weaker if not for McGraw-Hill, the US publishing group that also owns Standard & Poor’s.Its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $44.43 after Jana Partners, a hedge fund, revealed that it had taken a stake, leading to speculation that the company may be broken up .Shares in Pfizer, the drugmaking giant, dropped 4.6 per cent to $18.14 despite it topping second-quarter earnings-per-share targets, coming in at 60 cents versus 58 cents. It said it was bracing for further declines in sales of established drugs such as Lipitor.Exchanges group NYSE Euronext was off by 4.9 per cent to $31.40. It reported earnings of 61 cents in the quarter versus forecasts of 59.5 cents, but warned that revenue capture could slow if trading volumes rebound.MetroPCS, the US wireless group, fell sharply by 37 per cent to $10.26 after it reported earnings well wide of the mark at 24 cents per share versus the 28 cents per share forecast.That result dragged down competitors as well with American Tower falling 3.8 per cent to $50.50.
67;JWN;Nordstrom;2011-04-07T19:08:44Z;Luxury US brands enjoy sales boost;;"Luxury and specialist brands such as Victoria’s Secret enjoyed an uptick in US retail spending in March, while middle-market retailers led by Gap suffered as consumers grew in confidence but shopped selectively.Retail sales grew by about 2 per cent year on year as the impact of high fuel prices and worries over crises in the Arab world and Japan were offset by an improving US labour market.But while Victoria’s Secret, a lingerie chain owned by Limited Brands, reported sales up 19 per cent at stores open a year or more, sales for Gap in North America fell by 9 per cent.“It is not a rising tide that lifts all ships,” said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “The consumer is discerning. The more premium products and brands seem to be faring better; the less-prestigious brands and the lower-priced products are not faring so well.”Gap’s woes were exacerbated by an effort to revamp its product line-up and marketing, which the company acknowledged have been problematic. It shook up its management in February, including the appointment of a new creative director.Luxury department stores also reported strong figures, with sales up 11.1 per cent at Saks and 8.8 per cent higher at Neiman Marcus. Sales at Nordstrom, an upmarket fashion store, rose 5.1 per cent.“The retailers have to be happy with how things shaped up this month. The consumers have been resilient,” said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics. “What was underestimated was the improving jobs picture over the past several months, which is giving consumers more confidence to spend.”In March, the US economy generated a stronger-than-expected 216,000 jobs, the second consecutive month of growth.But on the divergence in retailers’ fortunes, Mr Perkins said: “Strong performers are gaining strength and the weaker ones not.”Among mid-market and low-end department stores, sales were down 1 per cent at Dillards and 6.5 per cent at Kohl’s. Target, a discount retailer, reported a 5.5 per cent fall.Headline figures from Retail Metrics showed retail sales up 2.2 per cent in March while the International Council of Shopping Centers reported a 2 per cent gain.The growth was down from an expansion of 4 per cent in February, but would have been higher had it not been for distortions stemming from the late timing of Easter this year.Many Americans buy clothes in a new season splurge in the weeks leading up to the Easter break. With Easter Sunday falling on April 4 last year, March caught a large chunk of that shopping. But with the holiday this year on April 24, it had no impact last month.Sherif Mityas, a partner in the retail practice at AT Kearney, a management consultancy, said: “People need to be encouraged but still cautious, because there are a lot of pressures.“Unemployment is better, but there are still a lot of people out of work. Inflationary pressures are rising and at some point those costs are going to need to be passed on.”"
68;JWN;Nordstrom;2011-03-03T19:02:53Z;US retailers report robust February sales;;US consumers returned to shopping malls in February, shrugging off harsh winter weather and demonstrating a renewed willingness to spend.Sales at large US retailers were stronger than analysts had expected, with luxury chains and department stores leading the way and robust demand at merchants such as Saks and Nordstrom.The 4.3 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales surpassed the 3.8 per cent advance that was projected and was stronger than last year’s increase, according to data from Retail Metrics.“February 2011 will go down as a month where improved consumer sentiment, tax refunds in hand and stimulus in pay cheques created a spark in the minds of consumers to buy discretionary goods and not be so stringent on the type and amount of daily necessities bought,” said Brian Sozzi, a retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies.Same-store sales at Saks rose 15.3 per cent on the back of greater demand for women’s apparel, men’s apparel, shoes, handbags, fashion jewellery, cosmetics and fragrances.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie chain, benefited as purchases heated up around Valentine’s day and it reported a 12 per cent increase in comparable store sales.Meanwhile, Macy’s sales were up 5.8 per cent thanks in part to a surge in online shoppers.“Consumer reaction to new spring merchandise has been encouraging,” said Terry Lundgren, Macy’s chief executive.February tends to be a weaker month for retailers. However, last month was an exception for many after a stormy January held shoppers back.But in spite of rising sales, signs of inflation could create a spring lull, as consumers are forced to spend disposable income on more expensive food and fuel.“We’re starting to see inflation flow through at this point,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.“The question is how much will consumers be able to take in terms of price increases before they stop buying.”On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said that retailers in many parts of the US were implementing price increases or planning to do so in the next few months.Analysts argue that rising petrol prices have a two-month lag before they have a negative impact on retail sales, potentially posing a problem in May and June.So far, high-end and discount stores have fared the best, while mid-range retailers such as Gap, Kohl’s and Dillard’s have experienced slower sales.David Bassuk, head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consultancy, said that consumers at high-end chains have been helped by a wealth effect from elevated stock prices and discounters have benefited from the ability to offer aggressive promotion schemes.“We see it as the hour glass effect, where the ones at the top and bottom are finding their place, but those in the middle are squeezed,” Mr Bassuk said.
69;JWN;Nordstrom;2011-02-18T03:17:55Z;Nordstrom to acquire HauteLook;;Nordstrom, the upmarket US fashion department store chain, is acquiring HauteLook, one of a new generation of online “flash sale” marketplace sites, in a deal reflecting the merger of digital and “bricks and mortar” stores.The retailer is buying HauteLook, founded four years ago, for $180m in stock, with the possibility of the cost rising to $270m dependent on its future performance.Blake Nordstrom, president, said “continuing to find ways to use technology to serve customers the way they want to be served is critical” for its business.HauteLook is one of a number of flash sale sites established during the past few years that offer limited time deals on fashion and other goods, and whose success has attracted the attention of strategic bidders.In 2009 GSI Commerce, a web services company, bought Rue La La for $350m, while Amazon, the online retailer, acquired BuyVIP, a European site, last year for about $100m. Nordstrom is the first established bricks and mortar retailer to acquire one of the leading sites.Other retailers, including Ebay and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, have set up their own versions of the concept, with Neiman running a “Midday Dash” sale every Friday lunchtime. Nordstrom said it plans to run the HauteLook site as a stand-alone business and retain the existing management.Nordstrom operates 115 department stores and 86 Nordstrom Rack stores selling excess and “off-price” merchandise.The move also reflects the growing interest of Nordstrom and its rivals in off-price selling of excess and lower priced fashion merchandise. Both Neiman and Nordstrom have been expanding their off-price store chains, with Nordstrom planning to open 19 off-price Nordstrom Rack stores next year, and three of its main fashion department stores.The department store has also been a leader in the US luxury sector in developing its online presence. Last year, it relaunched its website to incorporate customer reviews and community discussion pages.It has also pioneered technology that allows it to serve its web customers from available inventory in any of its stores, rather than relying on distribution warehouses. The system contributed to its annualised inventory turnover reaching a record 5.6 per cent during the fourth quarter, up from 5.4 per cent a year earlier.Nordstrom also reported strong fourth-quarter results on Thursday, with earnings up 35 per cent at $232m, or $1.04 per diluted share, on a 10.9 per cent sales increase to $2.82bn. Its sales and earnings have now risen above the pre-crash levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the recovery in spending by its largely affluent customer base.The retailer said it plans to open 19 new Nordstrom Rack stores in the coming fiscal year, and three full-price department stores.
70;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-11-27T00:44:33Z;Black Friday brings mixed cheer;;US stocks slipped as eurozone worries and concerns about Korea overshadowed hopes for a bumper “Black Friday” shopping day.Stocks oscillated during the week as investors were torn between being cheered by unexpectedly good data on the US economy, and worried by the European sovereign debt crisis and the possibility of conflict on the Korean peninsula.But during a short and low-volume trading day following Thanksgiving, investors were avoiding risk.The S&P 500 slid 0.8 per cent to close at 1,189.26, lower by 1 per cent on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to close at 11,089.80, falling 1.1 per cent over the week, and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,534.56 but rose 0.4 per cent on the five days.The S&P 500 materials index lost 1.3 per cent, with Alcoa, the aluminium producer, declining by 0.9 per cent to $13.19 and Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore producer, also sinking 0.9 per cent to $69.03.Del Monte gained 4.5 per cent to $18.80, and 7 per cent over the week, after the food producer agreed to a buy-out by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity house. The deal values Del Monte at about $5bn, including debt, or $19 per share.KKR edged lower by 0.8 per cent to $12.74 after it made the acquisition.CPI International, the telecoms equipment maker, was bought by an affiliate of Veritas Capital for $19.50 per share in cash, or $525m. The shares jumped 33.5 per cent to $19.31 after the offer, which was made at a 35 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price.Retail stocks were mixed even though investors were expecting a bumper start to the holiday shopping season. The S&P 500 retail index dipped 0.4 per cent, after climbing 2.7 per cent during the week.Stores offering large discounts to get customers queueing outside in the middle of the night included Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Best Buy nudged down 0.1 per cent to $44.75 as Brian Dunn, chief executive, said in the mid-morning that the consumer electronics retailer was “pleased with our traffic so far”. But Walmart lost 0.5 per cent to $53.73 and Target was lower by 0.7 per cent to $56.88.Online retailers were not left out of the Black Friday excitement with Amazon.com offering special deals throughout the week. Shares in Amazon added 0.1 per cent to $177.50. Department stores were also mixed. Macy’s gained 0.4 per cent to $26, while Nordstrom fell 0.3 per cent to $43.60 and JC Penney slid by 0.9 per cent to $32.51.SanDisk climbed 11.1 per cent over the week to $44.99. The maker of flash memory cards received positive analyst coverage from UBS and a ratings upgrade from “neutral” to “outperform” by Robert W Baird.
71;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-11-23T20:07:43Z;Low-cost stores expand as bigger shops falter;;TJ Maxx has opened its third store in Manhattan on 57th Street – with the “off-price” retailer moving into space previously occupied by a branch of Gap, the leading US speciality clothing retailer.Marshalls, another off-price retailer owned by TJ Maxx’s parent company, TJX, is opening an outlet in the city’s Chelsea district, selling a similar selection of end-of-range mid-price and aspirational branded merchandise.Nearby on Union Square stands the recently opened Nordstrom Rack store, operated by the upmarket Nordstrom department store to dispose of out-of-season or excess clothing stock.For once, Manhattan’s retail changes are accurately reflecting changes in the country as a whole – with TJX and its rivals continuing to open stores at pre-recession rates, as mainstream rivals pause or slow expansion.Over the past two years, the largest off-price retailers – TJX and Ross Stores – have regularly reported sales growth outperforming conventional department stores, with comparable sales gains running in the mid-single digits. Their stores, known for their overflowing racks and discounts of up to 60 per cent, were prime beneficiaries of shoppers abandoning traditional department stores to “trade down” by searching for brand-name bargains.But both claim they can continue to expand even as the economy improves, benefiting from changed shopping habits among customers across all income levels.Michael O’Sullivan, Ross’s chief operating officer, has told investors that from experience of past downturns, “when we pick up new customers …we tend to hold on to [them] even when the economy picks up”.The two groups also argue that their established position in the stock liquidation business – which accounts for about 7 per cent of US clothing sales – will help them stave off competition from online competitors such as Ebay and Overstock.com.Laura Champine, retail analyst at Cowan & Co, says the scale of purchases by the largest off-price retailers – who buy with short lead times of four to six weeks – gives them the market power that should guarantee them adequate supplies of excess branded merchandise even in a recovering economy.“A vendor who does not sell to them runs the risk of not being able to move excess inventory,” she says.TJX, which also operates the TK Maxx stores in Europe, has 2,799 stores, and had sales of more than $20bn last year. Ross Stores, with more than 1,030 stores in the US and sales of $7.2bn, has hopes of eventually doubling the number of its US locations.
72;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-11-16T22:23:11Z;Show of retail strength fails to halt wider US retreat;;Concerns about the risks of Chinese inflation and Eurozone sovereign debt overshadowed increases in forecasts from US retailers Walmart and Home Depot.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent. The materials and energy sectors led the decline, losing more than 2 per cent as they followed commodity prices lower.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 1,178.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had also lost 1.6 per cent to close at 11,023.50 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.8 per cent lower at 2,469.84.However, a flurry of retailers reporting earnings helped the S&P 500 retail index limit its losses to just 0.6 per cent.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, added 0.8 per cent to $54.50 after it raised its full-year guidance. Earnings rose during the quarter as income from international operations jumped.Elsewhere in retail, Home Depot also lifted its full-year earnings outlook even though the home improvement retailer cut its forecast for sales growth.In the third quarter it outperformed Lowe’s as same-store sales increased 1.5 per cent compared with largely flat sales at its rival.Shares in Home Depot added 1 per cent to $31.71 while Lowe’s shares rose 0.5 per cent to $21.57.Saks and Nordstrom saw a rise in luxury spending. But Saks fell 1.4 per cent to $11.16 after it reported an unexpectedly high quarterly profit as sales rose. The high-end department store chain forecast a mid-single digit rise in sales during the fourth quarter.In contrast, department store owner Nordstrom narrowed its forecast for the full year to a range below average analyst expectations. Nordstrom shares dropped 3.1 per cent to $40.55 even though surging sales helped the retailer report a better-than-expected profit for the quarter.Liz Dunn, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said there could be upside to the retailer’s guidance if the high-end customer continued to show resilience.Competing department store stocks also fell, with Macy’s losing 2.2 per cent to $24.15 and Kohl’s nudging down 0.6 per cent to $50.65.Among other retailers announcing their earnings, clothing chain Abercrombie & Fitchbeat expectations.International demand helped Abercrombie & Fitch and the shares, which have risen 29 per cent since the retailer reported its second-quarter earnings in August, advanced 0.8 per cent to $45.68.Sales from the Urban Outfitters website and the fashion retailer’s catalogues jumped 31 per cent in its third quarter, helping total sales rise by double-digits and lifting the chain’s earnings above expectations. Shares in the chain rose 11.9 per cent to $36.64.

The fashion and luxury brands company said it expects sales in its fiscal year 2011 to rise by a low double-digit percentage, higher than it previously forecast.But the company also said margins would decline in the second half of the year because of rising labour, raw material and transportation costs.Macy’s, the department store chain, adapted to local tastes and benefited from a rise in spending at its high- end Bloomingdale’s stores.The retailer beat expectations, reporting a quarterly profit compared with a loss for the same period last year.Sales were higher than expected and the company reaffirmed its forecast for same-store sales in the fourth quarter to rise 3-4 per cent. The chain also edged its full-year profit outlook higher to a range above some analyst estimates. However, its shares slipped 1.4 per cent to close at $24.86, after rising 28 per cent in the last three months. Rivals rallied with Nordstrom higher by 1.2 per cent to $42.39 and Saks gaining 1.1 per cent to $11.56.But Michael Exstein, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said that a sharp recovery in department store stocks meant that they were already 80 per cent of the way to their prior peak and may be nearing the top of the cycle.“This has, and always will be, a cyclical group due to the high fixed-cost nature of the business,” he said. “Once again, investors may be focusing too much on the upside and should consider where the group is today relative to prior cycles.”The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,218.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,357.04 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.6 per cent higher at 2,578.78.“Essentially what we’re seeing right now is profit-taking, we’ve had a nice-sized run and people are a little bit nervous,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research.Investors, still recovering from last week’s quantitative-easing fuelled rally, were not inspired by the better-than-expected initial jobless claims, which fell to a four-month low. The US trade deficit narrowed more than was expected in September as the weak US dollar helped American exporters offset near-record imports from China.Some pharmaceutical stocks fell, with Eli Lilly declining 0.8 per cent to $34.99 and Pfizer dropping by 1 per cent to $16.83.In industrials, Boeing shares were sent 3.2 per cent lower at $67.07 after the emergency landing of a test flight of a 787 Dreamliner. It was reported that the aircraft was forced to land due to a fire on board. The new model has been delayed six times because of a combination of problems with new materials, parts shortages and redesigning work.Research in Motion, the maker of BlackBerry handsets, jumped 6.3 per cent to $58.44 after it said that the PlayBook, its tablet computer, will sell for less than $500, making it cheaper than Apple’s iPad.But Apple shares still edged up 0.6 per cent to $318.03.Shares in Campbell Soupsuffered, falling 3.3 per cent to $34.85 after the company lowered its full-year forecast as shoppers shied away. Earnings per share will climb 2-4 per cent for the year that ends in July compared with its previous guidance of 5-7 per cent.Kelly Services, the employment agency, beat expectations in its third quarter as demand for temporary employees rose.

74;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-11-05T00:01:08Z;US shoppers regain taste for ‘luxury light’;;From lingerie and handbags to organic vegetables and lattes, America’s middle-class shoppers are regaining some of their taste for the aspirational and discretionary products that were hard hit by the economic downturn.In a sign of the changing mood, Victoria’s Secret, known for its $50 bras and sexy marketing, said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year had risen 14 per cent in October compared with the same period last year.Starbucks, home of the indulgent $3 coffee, saw an 8 per cent increase in comparable sales at its US stores during its most recent quarter, continuing a yearlong revival of its fortunes.Shares in Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural grocer whose sales slumped at the start of the recession, rose 15 per cent to $47.27 after it reported an 8.9 per cent increase in identical-store sales over the past five weeks.Joel Bines, a retail consultant at AlixPartners, said there was growing evidence of a return of what he called “luxury light” spending by aspirational consumers, on top of the recovery at the top-end luxury market seen since the start of the year.“In 2008 and 2009, the aspirational consumer evacuated the segment . . . and then began slowly to creep back in again. They are starting to unlock the purse strings a bit,” Mr Bines said.Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, underlined the continuing strength of demand from the wealthiest US consumers, with October’s comparable sales up 11.5 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department store, reported a 4.8 per cent increase in October same-store sales at its full-price stores.The figures released on Thursday followed the announcement of a strong quarterly performance last week from Coach, the handbag and leather accessories brand, which predicted double-digit sales increases in the holiday season.Blue Nile, the online jeweller, is also forecasting a holiday quarter sales rise of between 3 and 12 per cent.Overall October sales figures from US chain retailers presented a more mixed pattern, with the Retail Metrics monthly index rising 1.5 per cent, its smallest gain since April, with unseasonably warm weather weighing on clothing sales.Additional reporting by Greg Farrell in New York
75;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-10-25T17:58:35Z;US retailers tackle unsold stock problem;;US retailers are stepping up investment in new technology that will allow them to connect shoppers with items lurking unsold on their shelves, as they battle to increase sales and earnings in a sluggish economy.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer by sales, has said it is working on a new “ship from store” system, that will make the hoodies, blouses and khaki trousers in its 1,040 US Gap stores available to online customers as well.Toby Lenk, head of Gap’s online business, told investors this month: “We can book an order online, and then send that order to the store for fulfilment. It’s going to allow us to stay in stock longer at the website …There’s great business potential from that.”As with most retailers, orders from Gap’s e-commerce operations are currently filled from warehouse distribution centres, with an inventory system that evolved separately from that used by their brick and mortar stores.Its planned embrace of “ship from store” technology follows other retailers, including Sports Authority, the sporting goods retailer, and Jones Apparel, the fashion retailer, who both launched similar systems this year. Toys R Us, the toy retailer, introduced a similar system for some of its stores this month.Nikki Baird, a consultant at Retail Systems Research, says that while some retailers recognised the need to bring store and online inventory together in the early years of the decade, they initially focused technology spending elsewhere.Unlike investments in new customer-facing technology, such as mobile phone marketing campaigns, the investment in backroom store systems offers a way of boosting sales and profits at a time when most retailers are no longer able to grow sales by opening new locations.Nordstrom, the fashion department store, linked inventory at its 115 stores to its e-commerce site in September last year, saying it led to it selling more stock at full price, and contributed to a “dramatic” improvement in inventory turns. Nordstrom’s inventory turns – the number of times it sells the total value of its stock – rose to 5.46 at the end of July, against 5.16 a year previously.Ms Baird says that for fashion retailers facing short seasonal windows, “there is a huge amount of value for the retailer to go to that effort to match that customer up with that item at another store”.Fiona Dias, head of strategy at GSI Commerce, the retail web-services company, says the systems address a long-standing retailing challenge. “Merchants in big retailers are just salivating. All of them have this problem of odds and sods littered all over their company …nobody in Bloomington, Indiana, wants it, but someone in Alaska does.”
76;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-10-07T14:42:15Z;Late back-to-school buying lifts retail sales;;US chain retailers reported broadly better-than-expected store sales during September, supported by last minute back-to-school and college shopping that boosted teen and youth retailers in particular.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales rose 2.7 per cent in September. He cited strong back-to-school selling “coupled with attractive fall fashions, aggressive promotions and a near-record September stock market rise” as factors supporting the performance.Limited Brands, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works, reported a 12 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, with margins up “significantly” as the company avoided the price-cutting promotions seen last year.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, said same store sales rose 4.8 per cent. Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the back-to-school period was “one of our most successful in years”. He highlighted the performance of its Material Girl teen clothing collection, a joint venture with Madonna, and its American Rag clothing for teen boys.JC Penney said its sales rose 5.1 per cent, ahead of expectations. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales up 3 per cent. Kohl’s said on Wednesday that it would increase its temporary holiday staff hiring this year by 20 per cent, reflecting new store additions and increasing confidence in holiday demand.Luxury and high-end stores also performed well, with Neiman Marcus reporting same store sales up 4.7 per cent, Nordstrom up 7.5 per cent and Saks up 6.5 per cent.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the strong performance of higher-end spenders was “especially encouraging for the economy and the upcoming holiday-shopping season because the top 20 per cent of households by income account for nearly 40 per cent of total consumption”.Several teen and youth fashion retailers who have struggled over the past year with sluggish discretionary spending also fared better than expected. Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 13 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Zumiez, a teen retailer, said its same store sales rose 17 per cent, and raised its earnings guidance for the quarter. Buckle and Aeropostale both saw comparable sales up 3 per cent.But Target, the discount retailer, said its 1.3 per cent increase in comparable sales was lower than it had expected, despite being pleased with its back-to-school performance. Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, reported a 1 per cent drop in same store sales, saying that September had been more challenging that it had expected.Sales at its Gap stores in North America fell 1 per cent, despite efforts to draw sales with a large marketing focus on black denim pants that the company said would increase inventory levels. Gap’s lower-price Old Navy stores reported a 5 per cent drop.Costco, the warehouse club, said on Wednesday that its same store sales rose 5 per cent, also slightly above Wall Street’s expectations, although US store sales excluding fuel were slightly below forecasts, at 2 per cent.

JP Morgan Chase declined 1.4 per cent to $38.41 and Bank of America lost 1.2 per cent to $13.11.But AIG rose 0.4 per cent to $37.45 after the bailed-out insurer said its board would meet later in the day to discuss an exit plan for the US Treasury.Citigroup gained 1 per cent to $3.92 after the US Treasury said it plans to sell a portion of $2.2bn of its Citigroup debt securities.The S&P 500 technology index was lifted for much of the day by Hewlett-Packard raising its forecast for 2011 but it ended the day flat. Intel fell 1.4 per cent to $19.24 and Microsoft declined 0.7 per cent to $24.50.Hewlett-Packard predicting 12 to 14 per cent growth in earnings to between between $5.05 and $5.15 per share compared with the current consensus estimates of about $4.99 per share.The technology company said it was adding thousands to its salesforce and forecast a 5 per cent to 7 per cent rise in revenue.However, the company did not announce a new chief executive, which many analysts hoped it would. Its shares rose 2.2 per cent to $42.53.Standard Microsystems, which makes circuits and systems software for personal computers, consumer electronics and the industrial and car markets, reduced its forecast for the third quarter, saying that earnings will be no more than 43 cents per share. The average analyst estimate was 45 cents, but its shares rose 1.3 per cent to $22.78.The oil price rose after inventories fell last week and pushed up energy stocks by 0.7 per cent.Natural gas producer EQT Corp gained 4.6 per cent to $35.48 after it announced strong production figures from two wells in Pennsylvania.

Fred Smith, chief executive, said he was “very bullish” on the outlook for next year, saying it was seeing a rebound in demand for express shipping and that it intends to raise ship-ping rates.In earnings news, Family Dollar Stores beat expectations as more shoppers turned to the discount chain for bargains.In its fourth quarter, earnings per share were 56 cents compared with forecasts of 51 cents.The retailer raised its expectations for its first quarter in 2011, with predicted earnings per share between 55 cents and 60 cents.Following retailers from Nordstrom to Gap, which have all recently announced share buy-backs, Family Dollar said it may repurchase up to $750m in shares. Its stock rose 1.6 per cent to $44.05.
78;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-09-02T21:35:25Z;Retailers help Wall St amid positive economic figures;;US stocks rose on Thursday after slightly better-than-expected data on initial jobless claims, pending home sales and retailers’ same-store sales boosted investor confidence.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent at 1,090.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 10,320.10 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent higher to close at 2,200.01.Initial jobless claims fell slightly last week, to 472,000 from a revised 478,000 for the week before. Economists had forecast an increase to 475,000 from a previously reported 473,000.“Thank heavens for small mercies,” said John Ryding, of RDQ Economics.He said the rises in jobless claims might have been because of changes in legislation authorising people to renew their benefits.“It would take a sustained move above 500,000 in claims to signal that the economy might be slipping back into recession,” he said.“However, even if claims fall back into the 450,000 area – as we judge likely over the coming weeks – they would still be at a level that historically has not been consistent with solid job creation.”Pending home sales increased unexpectedly in July, rising 5.2 per cent compared with the consensus forecast for a 1 per cent decline.The S&P 500 homebuilders index rose 2.2 per cent with DR Hortonleading the risers, gaining 2.5 per cent to $10.98. Home improvement retailers, which are heavily dependent on the housing market, also rose with Lowe’s up 3.3 per cent to $21.94.Factory orders edged up 0.1 per cent in July after declines in May and June.Most retailers reporting same-store sales from August – the key back-to-school season – beat analyst expectations.The S&P 500 retailers index climbed 1.9 per cent, pushing up the wider S&P 500 consumer discretionary index by 1.8 per cent.Costco, the largest US warehouse club operator, reported a 5 per cent rise in same-store sales in August, excluding gasoline. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $58.59. Same-store sales at Family Dollar Stores rose 6.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, beating the consensus forecast of 3.1 per cent. Its shares were 0.5 per cent higher at $43.50.Department store chains also did well, with Saks, Macy’s, Nordstromand Kohl’sbeating expectations. Saks, which was subject to bid speculation in the week, surged 10.8 per cent to $7.90 and Macy’s was up 2.6 per cent to $20.71. Nordstrom jumped 8.1 per cent to $32.76 and Kohl’s added 1.9 per cent to $49.31.Limited Brands posted a same-store sales increase of 10 per cent, helped by a 15 per cent sales rise at its Victoria’s Secret underwear chain. Its shares advanced 6.1 per cent to $25.75.But Abercrombie & Fitchfell 3.9 per cent to $35.16, in spite of beating sales estimates, after an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said promotions may have contributed to the gain and sales growth was slowing.The bidding war for the 3Par cloud computing company finally concluded after Dell, the original bidder, walked away. Hewlett-Packard raised its offer to $33 a share. Dell had proposed $32 but 3Par’s board declared HP’s bid the “superior proposal”. Shares in Dell rose 2 per cent to $12.36. 3Par rose 2.5 per cent to $32.88 and HP nudged up 1.2 per cent to $39.68.Burger King, which soared 14.7 per cent on Wednesday, jumped 25.1 per cent to $23.59 after it agreed to be bought by investment firm 3G Capital for $24 per share, or $4bn including debt.In other deal news, Avis Budget Group raised its offer for Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group to $40.75 a share in cash and 0.6543 of Avis stock, which it said was superior to the offer from Hertz Global Holdings.Dollar Thrifty had signed a deal with Hertz, but Avis said it would increase its offer to make up for any fee payable to Hertz to break the contract.Shares in Dollar Thrifty rose 1.2 per cent to $48.05.

Hertz rose 4.2 per cent to $9.47.Mariner Energy slid 2.6 per cent to $22.75 after an oil rig it owns in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire and there were reports of a mile-long oil sheen.
79;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-08-30T21:39:43Z;Retailers and financials lead Wall St lower;;US stocks dropped on Monday after data showed personal incomes rose less than expected, raising questions about the sustainability of consumer spending.The S&P 500 closed down 1.5 per cent at 1,048.93, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.4 per cent to close at 10,009.95 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.6 per cent lower at 2,119.97.Figures on consumer spending and personal incomes kicked off a bumper week for economic data that culminates in the release of the non-farm payrolls report on Friday.Personal incomes rose less than forecast in July, climbing just 0.2 per cent compared with the projected 0.3 per cent. Even though consumer spending rose slightly more than expected at 0.4 per cent (compared with economists’ estimates of 0.3 per cent) the gap between the figures raised concerns that the rise in spending may not be sustainable.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, said that the data, although slightly below expectations, did not point to anything the market did not know already but simply highlighted the high rate of unemployment.“If you had to summarise the situation in three words it would be jobs, jobs and jobs. The market is predominantly focusing on jobs and the Federal Reserve is exclusively focused on jobs,” he said.He added that soon he expected many corporate earnings forecasts to be revised lower. “They’ll have to come down and be more in line with the economic growth outlook. The central scenario is sluggish, sloppy, ugly growth, [but] not a double-dip recession.”Shares fell further after President Obama failed to address economic concerns. In an afternoon speech, he said that he and his economic team had looked at ways to bolster the economic recovery, including tax cuts for businesses, but did not provide an action plan.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index fell by 1.8 per cent and the index of retailers was down 2.2 per cent. Ralph Lauren declined 3.5 per cent to $75.46, department store owner Nordstrom fell 5.2 per cent to $28.72 and Home Depot lost 2.6 per cent to $24.32.The financial sector suffered the most in the S&P 500, down 2.2 per cent, with AIG falling 3.4 per cent to $34.00, Wells Fargo sliding 3.1 per cent to $23.25 and US Bancorp 4.4 per cent lower at $20.71.In technology, Cisco fell 2.4 per cent to $20.32, Microsoft was down 1.3 per cent to $23.64 and Google lost 1.3 per cent to $452.69.Deal activity continued to dominate the market as both Intel and 3M completed acquisitions.

US-listed shares in Infineon, which is based in Germany, fell 5.6 per cent to $5.61.Cogent, which makes technology for biometric identification, rose 24.4 per cent to $11.09 after industrial conglomerate 3M said it had agreed to buy the company for $10.50 a share, or $943m. 3M was down 1 per cent to $80.20.United Airlines rose 1.3 per cent to $20.71 after the US government cleared its merger with Continental Airlines, which nudged up 0.4 per cent to $21.89. The deal is still waiting for shareholder approval.3Par, the “cloud computing” company at the centre of a battle between Hewlett-Packard and Dell, fell 2 per cent to $31.82 as the bidding war continued. 3Par’s board said on Friday that HP’s most recent bid of $2bn was a “superior proposal”. Dell, previously the favoured bidder, responded by saying it was assessing making another offer.Dell rose 1.1 per cent to $12.02. HP was buoyed after it authorised an additional $10bn for share buy-backs, on top of $8bn announced last November. HP gained 1.5 per cent to $38.56.In other deal news, Genzyme was up 3.4 per cent to $69.91 after it rejected an $18.5bn offer from Sanofi-Aventis as “unrealistic”.Sanofi-Aventis had reiterated the proposal it made a month ago. The Paris-based pharmaceutical company said Genzyme was refusing to discuss the offer and that it was prepared to take the bid hostile.US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis fell 1 per cent to $28.63.

The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,173.48, down 5 per cent over the five days.Fears about the pace of the economic recovery dominated markets this week after the Federal Reserve downgraded its outlook for the economy.Weak Chinese economic data weighed on the industrials, materials and energy sectors. Data showed on Friday that US retail sales rose less than expected in July,
up 0.4 per cent compared with a forecast increase of 0.5 per cent.Excluding cars and petrol, purchases fell 0.1 per cent, showing that underlying consumer confidence remained shaky.Separate data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent and by 0.1 per cent excluding food and energy.Lawrence Creatura, vice- president and portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said July was not a significant month in the retail calendar and investors would be focusing on the back-to-school season as well as retailers reporting earnings next week for indicators of consumer confidence.The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose slightly more than expected in August but investors were un-moved by the data. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector declined 1.1 per cent, with the S&P 500 retailers down 1.4 per cent.JC Penney, the department store chain, warned of an “uncertain” outlook for consumer spending and lowered its profit forecast for the year.

81;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-08-13T18:05:06Z;JC Penney lowers earnings forecast;;Mike Ullman, chief executive of US department store chain JC Penney, painted a sombre picture of the economic health of his store’s core middle-class customers on Friday, as the chain lowered its earnings forecast for the year, citing weakening consumer sentiment.Mr Ullman, who is also a member of the board of the Dallas federal reserve, said JC Penney’s middle-income customers “have had the brunt of the effect of the job situation”, with the number of new entrants to the job market continuing to exceed new jobs created on a monthly basis.“To be realistic, the consumer restriction on credit, the job situation and the protracted housing situation has had the biggest impact on the middle-income consumer,” he said.He contrasted the situation with more prosperous households “that never ran out of money”, and lower-income consumers where “families are getting by taking care of the needs of their families, and they don’t have much flexibility beyond that”.JC Penney, with more than 1,000 stores in the US, lowered its earnings forecast for the full year to $1.40-$1.50 per diluted share, below a consensus forecast of $1.64, despite reporting stronger than expected second-quarter earnings.Its rival Kohl’s also lowered its full-year earnings guidance on Thursday, with its chief executive Kevin Mansell saying the store was still seeing a “cautious consumer”.“We see one that’s reluctant to spend. We see one that’s focused on the long-term value of what she buys,” he said.Kohl’s trimmed the top of its earnings forecast by 5 cents to $3.70 a share.Mr Ullman said that he expected virtually all of JC Penney’s forecast 2-3 per cent increase in comparable store sales in the third quarter would come from new initiatives, such as the launch of the MNG by Mango fashion units in its stores, rather than from strengthening underlying demand.The diminished expectations at Kohl’s and JC Penney contrasted with a more optimistic outlook this week from Macy’s and Nordstrom, department store chains that target more affluent customers.Nordstrom left its earnings guidance unchanged, with Blake Nordstrom, its president, saying management had not detected any changes in customer behaviour during the year, either upwards or downwards. It did not expect to see changes “in the foreseeable future,” he said.Macy’s raised its guidance for the full year, after reporting a stronger than expected second quarter, saying it was gaining market share from competitors, and citing “strong performance” at its Bloomingdale’s top end department stores.Macy’s also said it was pleased with initial demand this month at the beginning of the important back-to-school shopping season. However, Mr Ullman said he expected consumers to delay spending on items such as clothes and bedding for college as close as possible to the reopening of schools, with consumers trying to focus spending on the tax-free shopping days used by many states to support retail spending.
82;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-08-05T22:52:25Z;US store sales data give subdued picture;;US chain retailers’ July sales reflected the fitful nature of the recovery, with data released on Thursday showing pockets of strength offset by an overall picture of subdued demand.Several stores that hold the middle ground in the US retail landscape did well, with Macy’s, the largest US department store by revenues, reporting a 7.3 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Limited, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, saw same-store sales rise 7 per cent and raised guidance for the second quarter, as did Kohl’s, a mid-cost department store, whose sales rose 4.6 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said its same-store sales rose 1 per cent, with continued strength at its lower-cost Old Navy stores, and growth at Banana Republic. But sales at its Gap brand stores fell 6 per cent. Gap also raised earnings guidance for the quarter.JC Penney, a mid-price department store, reported its comparable sales fell 0.6 per cent.Dillards and Bon-Ton, two regional department store chains, reported comparable sales falls.Saks, the luxury department store, said comparable sales rose 6.4 per cent, while its rival Nordstrom reported 7.6 per cent growth.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 3 per cent, missing the 3.2 per cent forecast based on Wall Street analysts’ views. The index was pulled down by weakness at teen and youth retailers.TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded clothing, also saw sluggish sales growth of 2 per cent, after seeing much stronger growth from bargain-hunting shoppers during the recession.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the subdued overall picture came despite stepped up discounting and promotions by retailers.
83;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-07-08T14:33:48Z;Wall Street gains on positive data;;US stocks held on to the previous day’s gains on Thursday as a positive jobs report and decent retail sales data helped ease worries about a potential double-dip recession.Jobless claims were 454,000 last week, modestly better than the 460,000 expected. However, continuing claims dropped to 4.41m from 4.63m last week, significantly better than the 4.6m consensus estimate.“We’re getting a lot of mixed signals at the moment,” said Andrew Neale, partner and portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners. “The data are still not looking great. Earnings estimates have been cut so I am not surprised if companies are beating the reduced forecasts.”Volumes were relatively low, suggesting a lack of broad investor conviction.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent to 1,070.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.2 per cent to 10,138.99 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent to 2,175.40.Same-store sales for the past month from the big retail chains came in mixed on Thursday, helped by warm weather and promotions around the Memorial day holiday. June is traditionally a clearance month for retailers.Macy’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brandsall beat analysts’ average estimates.Macy’s rose 3 per cent to $18.44, Limited Brands rose 2.2 per cent to $24.21, JC Penney advanced 6.7 per cent to $23.24 and Abercrombie was up 7.8 per cent to $35.45. Nordstrom fell 0.2 per cent to $33.69.However, Costco, Target and Gap came in below expectations.Target dropped 0.8 per cent to $50.02 and Gap was down 7.6 per cent at $18.22. Costco still rose 2.6 per cent to $55.71.“June [figures] were lacklustre at best,” said Robert Samuels, senior retail analyst at Phoenix Equities. “Given that retail has significantly underperformed the market over the past month, we think a lot of the bad news is already in most of these names. However, we think a round of earnings cuts is in store for the back half and 2011 as spending remains choppy.”Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent to $26.64 as the fourth-largest US bank by assets said it would cut about 3,800 jobs and close its consumer finance business.

It said its Shanghai store, which is opening this weekend, is one of “many” it plans in the country.“The Chinese consumer’s love of luxury goods is an enticing opportunity for Apple,” said Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Xcel Energy, an owner of utilities assets that operate in eight US states, gained 1.1 per cent to $21.60 as the company restated its earnings guidance for the full year of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.
84;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-06-04T01:00:57Z;US store recovery slows in May;;The gradual recovery in US shoppers’ discretionary spending showed signs of slowing in May, according to monthly sales data from leading chain retailers released on Thursday.But several leading retailers suggested that bad weather in the first part of the month, and a shift in the timing of Memorial Day holiday shopping, may have affected spending more than continuing macroeconomic concerns.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 2.7 per cent against the same period last year, 130 basis points below initial expectations.Mr Perkins said the data suggested that consumers had “pulled back the reins on what looked like a fledgling spending recovery in the first quarter”.But the monthly figures were also affected by the timing of the Memorial Day holiday, which pushed sales from the last Sunday and Monday of the month into the retailers’ June reporting period.Sales of summer clothing were also affected by unseasonably wet and cool weather during the first half of the month.Frank Badillo, senior economist at Kantar Retail, argued that the “results provide some sign that the retail recovery will persist” in spite of wealth declines and economic uncertainties.Monthly sales at Target, the discounter whose performance has become a bellwether of broad consumer sentiment, increased 1.3 per cent against a year ago.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said in a statement that the retailer’s “recent experience reinforces our belief that we will continue to experience volatility in the pace of economic recovery”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, which reported a 1.4 per cent increase in comparable sales, cited the impact of the weather, saying its “business trend strengthened toward the end of the month as the weather turned warmer”.Kohl’s, the lower price department store, noted that business improved during the last week of the month, with its comparable sales up 3.5 per cent, better than it had expected.Neiman Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom, the luxury and high-end department stores also continued to provide evidence of the recovery in spending by better off consumers.Neiman Marcus said same store sales rose 7.8 per cent, and noted that its store sales growth was led by its locations in New York City and Texas. Saks comparable sales were up 5.8 per cent, and Nordstrom’s were up 3.7 per cent, with slower growth due to the later start of an annual half-year sale.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent, with only its North America Gap brand stores seeing a sales decline, by 2 per cent.Discount retailers also continued to outperform their full price competition, with TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded goods, reporting same store sales growth of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.Despite the continued sales growth seen by most retailers, their overall sales remain below levels seen in 2007 and the first part of 2008.
85;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-06-03T20:32:04Z;Wall St rally wanes after tepid retail sales;;"US stocks continued the previous day’s rally on Thursday, helped by some positive macroeconomic news, but lacklustre retail sales figures weighed on sentiment.Initial jobless claims were 453,000 last week, compared with the 455,000 consensus estimate, boosting hopes that Friday’s much-awaited non-farm payrolls would at least match expectations.However, ADP private sector payrolls increased by 55,000 last month, less than the 60,000 expected.The rally has been boosted by the recent entry of bargain-hunters into the market, said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities. “Never failing to look a gift horse in the mouth, however, we are quick to acknowledge that structural problems in the economic, political and ecosystems abound and remain threatening overhangs to the longevity of any near-term rally,” he added.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,102.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 10,255.28 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,303.03.The retail sales results were mixed with discounters broadly faring best, even if they fell below some analyst expectations.TJX Companies, owner of the TJ Maxx discount retail chain, added 0.4 per cent to $46.30 as it posted a better-than-expected increase in same-store sales last month and said it saw demand pick up substantially in the second half of the month as the weather turned warmer.Family Dollar Stores lost 3.6 per cent to $38.66 as the discount retailer gave a third-quarter profit outlook that missed analysts’ consensus estimates.BJ’s Wholesale Club, a warehouse discounter, fell 2.6 per cent to $38.76 in spite of an increase in same-store sales that topped analysts’ average expectations for a 6.6 per cent
gain.Costco Wholesale, BJ’s main rival, declined 1.7 per cent to $57.93 after the company reported sales data for May that missed average analyst estimates.Sales in stores open at least a year rose 9 per cent compared with expectations of 9.7 per cent.Abercrombie & Fitch, an upmarket teen fashion retailer, advanced 6.6 per cent to $37.58 after its May sales beat analyst estimates.It also said its average unit retail price declined by 6 per cent last month compared with a drop of 10 per cent last quarter.Rival Aeropostale gained 5.7 per cent to $30.01 as its sales last month topped expectations.Limited Brands, a clothing retail chain, gained 1.2 per cent to $26.26 as it said same-store sales had risen 5 per cent in May, easily beating the 2.1 per cent gain analysts had forecast. The company said it expected June same-store sales to be flat or slightly higher, in the low single-digits.Department store chains Macy’s and Saks reported better-than-expected same-store May sales. Their shares were up 0.4 per cent to $22.49 and 0.7 per cent to $9.14, respectively.However, rivals Nordstrom and JC Penney missed average expectations, sending their shares down 4.3 per cent to $38.52 and 0.3 per cent to $27.07, respectively.JPMorgan pulled back 1.1 per cent to $39.10 as its securities arm was fined £33.3m ($48.7m) by the UK’s Financial Services Authority for failing to protect billions of dollars of client money by not segregating it into separate accounts.Had the bank run into financial difficulties, its clients would have been at risk of losing their money. It is the largest penalty ever levied by the regulator.Shares in Joy Global, a maker of mining equipment, rallied 2.6 per cent to $53.81 after the company raised its full-year profit outlook and reported better-than-expected second-quarter results.Dynamex, a provider of same-day delivery services in the US and Canada, retreated 10.7 per cent to $14.35 after it lowered its earnings forecast for the current fiscal year to as low as $1.05 per share. The average analyst estimate is for $1.21 per share.However, FedEx and UPS, its main rivals, were up 0.8 per cent to $83.98 and 0.7 per cent to $63.01, respectively. AutoNation climbed 4.1 per cent to $21.32. The largest US new car dealer said revenues rose 22 per cent last month."
86;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
87;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-05-19T20:00:33Z;Jaeger buttons up for global expansion;;Jaeger, the fashion chain owned by entrepreneur Harold Tillman and retailer Belinda Earl, is eyeing international expansion as it increased underlying profits.Ms Earl said Jaeger had just opened within Galeries Lafayette, the French department store chain. It would open outlets in Ogilvy, the Montreal retailer, and the US’s Nordstrom department store from this autumn.Jaeger also plans to open more stores in continental Europe and expand its presence in the Middle East, while also looking to open a stand-alone store in the US.Ms Earl said overseas demand was being driven by the exposure of the Jaeger London brand, its most cutting-edge collection, to a wider audience.“We have been showing Jaeger London on the catwalk for the past five seasons. We are starting to really be desired by international customers,” she said.Jaeger is also looking to add further stores in London, where demand has been particularly strong, helped by the weak pound, which is encouraging overseas tourists to splash out.It is eyeing online expansion and will also introduce Boutique by Jaeger, its high street fashion range aimed at 20 to 25-year-olds, for the autumn-winter season.But Ms Earl denied that the expansion meant Jaeger, which was acquired by Mr Tillman six years ago having started life in 1884 when German doctor Gustav Jaeger extolled the benefits of wearing natural fibres, was being groomed for a sale or flotation.“We are quite happy with the ownership structure as it stands,” she said. “It is not something we are really considering at the moment.”Jaeger increased earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from £6m to £7m in the year to February 28, on flat sales of £85.5m ($123.3m).Sales were held back by the tough economic conditions, as well as the snowy weather over Christmas and the new year.Conditions improved throughout Jaeger’s financial year, with overall sales currently 12 per cent ahead of the year earlier. Jaeger concentrated on lifting profits, with fewer mark-downs and a tight control of stock and costs.Ms Earl said Jaeger was planning for VAT being increased to 20 per cent by the new government.But she was confident Jaeger’s own plans would offset any consumer weakness. “There is still an element of uncertainty on the political scene, but I think customers are responding to value and to great products,” she said.

Analysts said programme trades may have exacerbated the fall.At mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was down about 4 per cent to 1,120, and then plunged to its intraday low of 8.6 per cent.Tom Schrader, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus, says that once stocks reached 1,200, it triggered computer programmes that were set up to sell off at that level.“There is the possibility of some programme trades going wrong, and trades being executed in error.”“Liquidity at that point was thin, exacerbating the drop,” he added.Rich Adamonis, spokesman at NYSE Euronext, said: “There were a number of erroneous trades…Nasdaq is investigating.”At the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 3.2 per cent to 1,128.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.2 per cent to 10,520.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was 3.4 per cent lower at 2,319.64.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility rocketed up 39.1 per cent to $34.65, its biggest one-day change since February 2007.An unusual move in the Procter & Gamble share price, with the stock dropping to $39.37 from about $62 in a matter of minutes was being investigated by Nasdaq as trading error.

Aeropostale sales fell 5 per cent and its shares lost 6.7 per cent to $27.66.Gap fell 7.2 per cent to $22.91 after its sales fell 3 per cent; analysts were looking for a 1.3 per cent rise on average.Shares in Nordstrom, the high-end department store chain, pulled back 2.3 per cent to $42.49 even as its sales beat expectations to rise 7.5 per cent in the quarter. Rival Macy’s edged 3.5 per cent lower to $22.42 even after it reported a 1.1 per cent increase in same-store sales last month, exceeding its own and analyst forecasts.The company also raised its first-quarter profit forecast to 4 cents per share, excluding some items, compared with the average analyst estimate of 2 cents per share.Warehouse club operator Costco tumbled 3.9 per cent to $58.03 after its April sales data came in slightly lower than expected, rising 11 per cent versus average analyst estimates of a gain of 11.2 per cent.Americold Realty Trust, a warehouse operator owned by billionaire Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos, postponed its $660m initial public offering after slashing the mid-point price by 33 per cent.The offering, which was expected to be the year’s largest US listing, was originally priced at about double the average valuation of property firms worldwide.Internet stocks were in focus as the Federal Communications Commission said it would seek stronger authority to regulate companies that provide internet access after a recent court ruling reduced its powers.Cable operator Comcast and phone company AT&T have both warned that more regulation could damp investment.

But it also reported that a combined March-April rise of 3 per cent was its best sales jump in two years.Speciality were hit hard. Gap sales fell 3 per cent, while they had been expected to grow 1 per cent. Abercrombie & Fitch sales fell 8 per cent in April, well past its 2 per cent forecasted decline.Off-price clothing stores reported higher sales, though they also missed forecasts. Ross Stores reported a 3 per cent jump, and TJX rose 4 per cent.A few stores did exceed expectations, notably higher-end retailers. Nordstrom jumped 7.5 per cent, versus a 6.5 per cent forecast. Limited Brands reported a 4 per cent rise against expected flat growth.The rise in sales matches an uptick in consumption generally. First quarter US consumer spending rose 0.6 per cent, and personal consumption represented 2.6 percentage points of the first-quarter GDP growth figure of 3.2 per cent.“The trend is still upwards, but it’s not going to be a smooth ride,” said Julia Coronado, senior US economist at BNP Paribas. “There will be less government support for incomes going forward, but we are starting to see the labour market turn the corner.”The US is expected to have added jobs again in April, which would provide support for shoppers. The forecast is that Friday’s non-farm payroll figures will show growth of 189,000 jobs.

Same-store sales last month rose 3.7 per cent, versus analysts’ average projection of 2 per cent.Rival Nordstrom gained 1.4 per cent to $38.32 after the company’s same-store sales last month were almost double expectations.Limited Brands, which owns clothing retailers including the lingerie chain Victoria’s Secret, increased 1.5 per cent to $22.98 after posting an increase of 10 per cent in sales in stores open at least a year, beating the 9.3 per cent average analyst estimate.Retail Metrics, a research firm, estimated a total rise of 3 per cent in US same-store sales in February, which would represent the sixth straight monthly gain.Health insurance stocks were under strain as chief executives from the leading companies were summoned to Washington to discuss the rates they charge with Kathleen Sebelius, President Obama’s health and human services secretary.Cigna lost 1.9 per cent to $34.04, Aetna was 2 per cent lower at $30.65 and WellPoint declined 1.8 per cent to $61.23.UnitedHealth Group, the largest health insurer by market capitalisation, fell the most, losing 3.4 per cent to $32.95.Coca-Cola climbed 1 per cent to $54.47, helped by an upgrade by UBS from “neutral” to “buy”. UBS analysts cited last month’s deal to buy the North American operations of its bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises.PetSmart increased 8 per cent to $29.93 after the largest US pet store chain released fourth-quarter results and full-year earnings estimates that were better than expectations.“[The results showcased the company’s] attractive blend of non-discretionary and discretionary sales, its margin expansion potential and its evolution from a growth story to a cash flow story,” said Michael Lasser, analyst at Barclays Capital.Shares in Walt Disney gained 2.9 per cent to $32.57 on an upgrade by Bank of America Merrill Lynch from “neutral” to “buy”.“We believe the cyclical advertising recovery, a nascent consumer recovery, capital expansion projects, a new film creative cycle, retransmission deals and continued cable network growth foster multiple catalysts that could aid Disney’s fundamentals,” the broker said in a note.

98;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-02-23T23:27:20Z;Optimism dip fails to sink US retail hopes;Shoppers shift away from the bare necessities;"Some of the largest US retailers expressed growing confidence on Tuesday in the revival of discretionary spending by middle-class consumers, even as survey data showed a sharp decline in consumer confidence in February.Kathy Tesija, a senior executive at Target, the mass discounter with more than 1,700 stores, said the retailer’s customers were shifting away from a focus on necessities seen in the depths of the recession and “beginning to show signs of conscious optimism”.“Once hesitant and even fearful, they are now taking price in their new-found financial discipline, and their confidence is leading them to add a few more apparel and home items to their [shopping] basket,” she said.Karen Hoguet, chief financial officer of Macy’s, which runs 850 department stores, said the retailer was feeling “cautiously optimistic” about 2010, after a fourth quarter that saw improved spending on clothing and home goods.“We are seeing more balance in the business, with customers ready to buy brands that are better,” as long as they are appropriately priced, she said.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, reported improvements in its fourth quarter sales of expensive items such as kitchen cabinets, mirroring results on Monday at rival Lowe’s. Like Lowe’s, it forecast a return to same store sales growth in the year ahead, after almost four years of declines.The comments reinforced the picture of the US consumer that has emerged from other retailers and consumer goods companies in recent weeks of a split between those with jobs and the estimated 16.5 per cent of the workforce that is unemployed or obliged to work part time.Macy’s said its 40 upmarket Bloomingdale’s department stores had a “terrific” fourth quarter, following a 6.9 per cent increase in comparable store sales reported by its rival Nordstrom late on Monday. At Home Depot, transactions above $900, which account for about 20 per cent of sales at its US stores, declined less than
1 per cent during the quarter, against the double digit declines seen in the first three quarters of the year.Retailers reporting on Tuesday stressed their continuing concerns over unemployment and tight credit, concerns underlined by consumer confidence figures for February from the Conference Board, whose index fell to its lowest level in 10 months on short -term job worries.Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Macy’s, said the stores would continue to take a conservative approach to clothing inventory, while possibly taking a more aggressive approach in areas such as cosmetics.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer of Target, said the pessimistic consumer confidence reading reflected his view that there would be sometimes contradictory signs on the state of the broad consumer economy.”I think we’re going to be in the kind of environment where there’s going to be a lot of mixed signals,” he said."

Same store sales fell 1.6 per cent during the quarter, beating the company’s forecast that they would fall 2 per cent.Earnings guidance for the first quarter and the coming year were lower than analysts’ average expectations.Bank of America rose 2.1 per cent to $16.21 after it announced that its settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission had won court approval. Under the deal, Bank of America legacy shareholders will share $150m due to alleged mis-statements made by the bank about the purchase of Merrill Lynch in 2008.Judge Jed Rakoff said that he approved the deal “reluctantly”.Campbell Soup Company declined 1.3 per cent to $33.50 following disappointing results.Revenues in the second fiscal quarter were $2.15bn versus average expectations of $2.23bn.The company said it now expected 2010 revenues to rise 2.5-3.5 per cent, down 1.5 percentage points from its forecast in November.Campbell Soup said it would continue to focus on expanding its footprint in Russia and China.Falling natural gas and copper prices sent commodities stock lower.Chevron lost 1.5 per cent to $72.96 and ExxonMobil was 0.7 per cent lower to $65.40.Barrick Gold declined 2.5 per cent to $38.37, Goldcorp lost 1.7 per cent to $38.04, while Newmont Mining fell 1.7 per cent to $47.73.Clothing retail group Gap slipped 0.4 per cent to $19.77 as analysts at UBS downgraded their target price for the stock from $23 to $21 and reiterated a neutral rating.

100;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US shoppers splash out on luxury items;;More prosperous American shoppers seem to be defying continuing high unemployment levels and economic uncertainty to renew their spending on luxuries such as jewellery, fashion and cosmetics.That is the picture emerging from the current round of US earnings and sales reports.Tracey Travis, chief financial officer of Polo Ralph Lauren, said last week that the fashion brand and retail company had “slowly begun to see the gradual return of our core luxury customer”, including buyers of couture dresses that sell for more than $4,000.Fabrizio Freda, chief executive of Estée Lauder, has said that sales of its beauty products at “prestige” stores – such as traditional department stores – had grown faster than at “mass” drugstores and discounters during November and December, reversing the trend seen earlier in the year.“We view this as a return of the aspirational consumer,” he said.Sales of cognac in the US had jumped 19 per cent by volume during the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year, according to BNIC, France’s trade association of cognac makers.Last week’s January sales figures from leading US chain stores reinforced the picture of growing readiness to spend, with Neiman Marcus, Saks, ­Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s – the top upmarket US department stores – reporting strong sales growth, albeit from the depressed levels of a year ago.Neiman Marcus, which operates about 43 luxury fashion stores serving the most affluent US consumers, said that its strongest categories included women’s couture clothing and precious jewellery.Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth retailer known for its $60 polo shirts, reported that comparable sales had risen 8 per cent, its first monthly increase for 20 months, in spite of teenage unemployment running at about 26 per cent.The evidence of greater readiness to spend comes in spite of continuing high unemployment, with about 20 per cent of the US population unemployed or working casually or part time.Richard Hastings, retail strategist at Global Hunter Securities, said that roughly half of the 80 per cent of Americans fully employed were not affected by the depressed housing market and were now more ready to spend as they had become less concerned about their own jobs.The strength in the January sales numbers “suggests that sufficient spending is coming from the least affected parts of the consumer universe”, he said.
101;JWN;Nordstrom;2010-02-04T18:59:39Z;US retailers boosted by strong January;;Spending by US shoppers continued to bounce back from last year’s post-crash lows, with retailers ranging from luxury department stores to teen fashion boutiques on Thursday reporting stronger sales in January.Retail Metrics said its index of chain retailers’ same-store sales figures rose 3.3 per cent, higher than the 2.4 per cent forecast, the fifth successive month of positive year-on-year sales growth shown by the index.Retailers including Gap, Kohl’s and Macy’s, saw their shares rise as they raised expectations for their fourth-quarter earnings.The monthly sales numbers offered further indications of returning demand for prestige and luxury goods, with Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion department stores, reporting increases of 6.8 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, saw its comparable sales jump 14 per cent.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, highlighted a strong performance from its luxury Bloomingdales stores, as it reported a 3.4 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month and raised its earnings guidance.The performance of the prestige stores fits with recent comments from Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing brand company, and from Estée Lauder, the cosmetics maker, which have both reported stronger demand for their higher-priced products.The more mainstream retailers also enjoyed sales that were stronger than had been expected.Comparable sales at Kohl’s, the discount department store, rose 6.5 per cent, although Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said customers “remain conservative in their discretionary spending”.Kohl’s rival JC Penney reported a 4.6 per cent decline in comparable sales, but said this was better than the forecast decline of 5 to 8 per cent.Speciality clothing retailers also fared significantly better than last year, with Aéropostale’s same-store sales up 6 per cent, American Eagle up 10 per cent and Abercrombie & Fitch up 8 per cent.The Limited, which owns the Victoria’s Secret lingerie stores, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales while Gap, the largest US speciality clothing seller, reported a 5 per cent gain, led by a 10 per cent increase at its low-cost Old Navy chain in the US and positive sales at its Gap and Banana Republic brands.Comparable sales at Target, the discounter, rose 0.5 per cent, lower than Wall Street had expected. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports its same-store sales on a monthly basis.January is traditionally a month of transition for retailers, as they dispose of excess holiday inventory and prepare to bring in the spring ranges.
102;JWN;Nordstrom;2009-12-09T18:54:25Z;Neiman Marcus sees weak luxury demand;;Neiman Marcus, the US luxury retailer, said on Wednesday it was seeing “some encouraging signs” of a recovery in parts of its high-end business, while warning that it expected overall demand to remain weak for some time.Burt Tansky, chief executive, said: “It is hard to predict whether we have bottomed out, hopefully we have . . . If nothing unusual occurs, I feel we can see continued improvement.”Mr Tansky, a veteran luxury retailer, cited recovering sales at its main New York store, Bergdorf Goodman, which he said was supported both by regular customers and by foreign tourists taking advantage of the weaker US dollar.Bergdorf’s “business is starting to bounce back”, he said. The store accounts for about 10 per cent of Neiman’s total sales..He also said the retailer had needed to reorder items including some women’s shoe lines and contemporary fashion, after experiencing stronger-than-expected holiday demand.The retailer’s 41 luxury fashion department stores have reduced stock levels by more than 20 per cent since last year’s post-crash slump in luxury sales.Mr Tansky said items selling strongly included cashmere sweaters, women’s flat shoes and over-the-knee boots. But he also warned affluent customers remained cautious. “We are aware our customers are still concerned about both the current economy and the future . . . Today we find the customer is very measured and deliberate in her purchasing,” he said.Neiman Marcus and rivals have been seeking to tempt customers back to full-price shopping, after the price discounts of 60 to 70 per cent seen in last year’s holiday shopping season. The retailer has been offering customers gift cards against future purchases, and offering extra points on its customer loyalty cards.Neiman Marcus has also worked with its luxury vendors to increase the range of products available at opening and middle price points. Mr Tansky said Neiman Marcus was also considering establishing an international e-commerce business, to supplement online and catalogue sales that account for more than 15 per cent of business. Its rival Nordstrom announced plans for international online sales last month.The retailer reported a 13.7 per cent decline in comparable sales for its first quarter ending October 30 against the same period last year. It posted an 8 per cent fall in operating earnings to $74.8m, with an 11.9 per cent decline in total revenues to $868.9m.Neiman Marcus was acquired by an investor group led by Texas Pacific Group and Warburg Pincus in October 2005.
103;JWN;Nordstrom;2009-11-27T12:52:58Z;US retailers turn to social media on ‘Black Friday’;;US retailers were on Friday unleashing a traditional barrage of post-Thanksgiving holiday shopping promotions, with the National Retail Federation expecting 134m Americans to head for the stores.This year, however, the retailers have reinforced their traditional efforts with an array of social-networking weapons including Twitter, the micro-blogging website.Retailers including discounters Target and Walmart, and department store groups Macy’s, Kohl’s and JC Penney have used Facebook pages to publish the “doorbuster” and “early bird” deals traditionally announced in newspaper advertising inserts on Thanksgiving, the day before “Black Friday” – so called because it was once the day on which retailers’ ledgers for the year moved out of the red and into the black.Brad Smith, head of social networking at Best Buy, said the electronics retailer had targeted its more than 1m Facebook fans when it decided this year to publish its Black Friday deals early for the first time.“We released the deals at 2am last Sunday, and even at that time of night we had literally 1,000 responses within an hour or two,” said Mr Smith.Best Buy is also using Twitter for the first time to publicise its “deal of the day” running on the shopping days leading up to Christmas. “This is the first year in which social media is playing such an important role for all of our marketing,” said Mr Smith.Other stores planning to use Twitter to pull in shoppers include Target, JC Penney, American Eagle and Nordstrom.Further, more than a dozen top retailers are launching customised mobile e-commerce sites ahead of the holidays.Alongside traditional buy-one-get-one-free deals, more conventional strategies have included stores opening early, with Toys R Us joining a handful of retailers that planned to open at midnight for the first time. Some stores, such as Old Navy and Gap, were even opening at midday on Thanksgiving itself.Other retailers including Target, the discounter, and Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing chain, are for the first time offering money-back gift cards on sales.Toys R Us is also seeking to woo shoppers by guaranteeing the first 100 people in queues outside its stores the chance to buy a $10 Zhu Zhu Pet robotic hamster – the season’s hottest toy.But the retailers’ promotional activity this year will also reflect less desperation than last year, when the slump in spending after September’s Wall Street slide forced drastic price cuts to clear stock. Clothing retailers in particular have entered the two-month holiday season with inventory levels that are more than 10 per cent below last year.In spite of the marketing hullabaloo, retail analysts point out that the day is not necessarily an indicator of how retailers will perform over the entire holiday shopping season.Mike Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the day was “typically is not a precursor of the entire holiday season’s sales picture”.Follow Jonathan Birchall’s Black Friday at http://twitter.com/Birchall_Jon

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 10,270.47 and the Nasdaq was up 0.9 per cent to 2,167.88.“Overall trading suggests that sentiment appears indecisive heading into the weekend and that investors may look to Monday’s US retail sales report to set direction for next week,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.US stocks hit fresh highs for the year this week after assurances from the Federal Reserve over low interest rates lured in more investors.A rush of deal activity also raised hopes that corporate America was returning to health.Kraft launched a hostile bid for Cadbury on Monday, which the British chocolate-maker promptly rejected.After the closing bell on Wednesday, Hewlett-Packard announced that it had struck a deal to buy 3Com, sending shockwaves through the rest of the networking gear industry.Over the week, the S&P gained 2.3 per cent, the Dow was up 2.5 per cent and the Nasdaq 2.6 per cent.“It’s been a slow news-week and volumes have been light but we expect economic data to continue to drive this market higher,” said Ryan Detrick, senior strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.Positive surprises from the consumer discretionary sector helped to lift the market further on Friday.Shares in Walt Disney rose 4.8 per cent to $30.44 after the world’s largest media and entertainment group reported an 18 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profit.The company also lifted the mood across the industry after optimistic comments about the prospects for television advertising over the next six months.Abercrombie & Fitch, the fashion retailer, also surprised analysts by reporting a smaller decline in profit than had been expected, mainly due to aggressive cost cutting. Its shares rose 10.7 per cent to $40.68.Elsewhere in the retail sector, Goldman Sachs upgraded PetSmart to “buy” from “neutral”, citing the prospect of improved margins. Its shares gained 3.9 per cent to $25.67.Nordstrom, the department store chain, warned that its gross margin would not increase in 2009 as much as analysts had hoped. Its shares slid 1.5 per cent to $33.99.Shares in JC Penney, the third-largest department store in the US, gained 6.2 per cent to $31.21 after the retailer raised its annual profit forecast.In its market debut, Dollar General, the discount retailer that is almost entirely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, rose 8.2 per cent to $22.73 after pricing shares at the lower end of estimates.Goodyear Tire & Rubber also added to the market’s optimism after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”.Earlier in the week, the group said it would raise prices on consumer replacement tyres in North America by up to 6 per cent to help offset higher raw materials costs. Its shares rose 4.4 per cent to $14.34.Blockbuster, the largest movie rental chain in the US, posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss after the closing bell on Thursday. Its shares fell 6 per cent to 78 cents.Lime Energy was one of the day’s biggest fallers after the engineering company reduced its sales forecast.Shares in the group, which specialises in energy-efficient products, plunged 23 per cent to $4.88.
105;JWN;Nordstrom;2009-11-05T16:26:28Z;US shoppers still cautious in October;;US chain retailers’ October sales figures on Thursday underlined shoppers’ cautious mood, with many mainstream retailers still seeing flat or declining sales against the lows seen a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store, reported comparable sales at stores open at least a year that were only slightly down from October 2008, decreasing 0.8 per cent. Target, the discounter, also reported sales slightly down at 0.1 per cent, with Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, describing the performance as “slightly better than our expectation”.But sales at JC Penney, the mid-range department store with around 1,000 locations, decreased 4.5 per cent. The company said it had seen better-than-expected sales during the first half of the month, but that sales “turned softer and were below expectations in the final week”. Its rival Kohl’s reported a 1.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, missing Wall Street’s forecast of a gain of almost 5 per cent.Teen retailers also continued to struggle. Abercrombie & Fitch saw its comparable sales fall 15 per cent, and American Apparel saw a 6 per cent drop. Aeropostale reported a positive 3 per cent, but far below the 14 per cent gain expected by Wall Street.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, delivered a positive surprise, reporting a 4 per cent increase that marked its first company-wide comparable-sales increase for two-and-a-half years.Gap’s improvement came against the 16 per cent fall in same-store sales it saw last October, underlining the fact that most full-price retailers are still seeing sales subsantially below pre-crash levels.More well-heeled customers also showed some readiness to spend. Nordstrom, the fashion department store, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales, while Saks saw a 0.7 per cent increase - against last October’s 16.6 per cent fall.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales data, said its index of comparable-store sales rose 2.2 per cent, a second consecutive monthly increase.The index was boosted by continuing stength of off-price retailers TJ Maxx and Ross Stores, which reported same-store sales gains of 10 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, continuing to benefit from consumers’ frugal focus.A monthly survey of consumer confidence released on Thursday by RBC also highlighted a mood of continuing caution. RBC’s consumer attitudes and spending by household index fell to 30.5, down 21.6 points from October’s 51.8 reading. The group described the fall as “the sharpest one-month drop in consumer sentiment since last autumn’s financial crisis”, and cited factors including unemployment concerns.“Although we have pulled back from the abyss, consumer attitudes remain susceptible to negative news,” said Ira Jersey, head of US interest rate strategy for RBC Capital Markets.
106;JWN;Nordstrom;2009-11-02T21:49:00Z;Ford drives Wall St higher;;US equities were volatile on Monday, turning sharply negative during the afternoon as financials slumped, before recovering some lost ground.Initially, stocks rallied, boosted by upbeat economic reports and a surprise swing to profitability for Ford.The US carmaker posted its first quarterly profit in more than a year as cost-cutting and the government’s “cash-for-clunkers” rebates helped produce earnings of nearly $1bn, or 29 cents a share, during the third quarter.That confounded expectations of a 12-cent-a-share loss and Ford closed up 8.3 per cent at $7.58.After the closing bell, Stanley Works announced it would acquire Black & Decker in an all-share deal valued at $4.5bn.After dipping as much as 0.7 per cent during the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent higher at 1,042.88, half its earlier rise of 1.5 per cent.It was a wild ride on Monday for Vix, the index of S&P options volatility. After dropping 8.5 per cent to 28, Vix powered back above 30, only to ease a tad as stocks recovered. Last week, Vix closed above 30, for the first time since July a sign of rising fear for stocksThe S&P financials also rebounded from an afternoon slide of 1.8 per cent, sparked by worries that the banking system remains vulnerable in the wake of CIT filing for bankruptcy on Sunday.“Weakness among financials was also likely reflecting investor concerns as how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will build reserves against future loses in an environment that’s already seen 100 banks fold this year,” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.Elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite closed higher by 0.2 per cent at 2,049.20, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,789.44.The behaviour of equities on Monday came after last week’s decline of 4 per cent for the S&P, which helped drag the broad benchmark into negative territory for October, its first monthly decline since February.Investors enter November facing a busy week of data, the end of the earnings season and a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Any change in the central bank’s policy statement as to the timing of removing easing policy could weigh on sentiment, notably in the bond market.Later in the week, attention will focus on the release of the October employment report. Economists expect a decline of 175,000 jobs during October with the unemployment rate rising 0.1 percentage points to 9.9 per cent.“The bottom line in Friday’s jobs data is likely to be that the labour market remains a significant source of vulnerability for the economic recovery,” said Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson Icap.On Monday the market was propelled to its intra-day highs after the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index was 55.7 for October.That was higher than an expected rise of 53 and was the best reading since April 2006. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion.Meanwhile, construction spending for September rose 0.8 per cent, its biggest gain since September 2008, and pending home sales for September were up 6.1 per cent as the home buyer tax credit boosted activity.Sentiment for stocks was also boosted by other earnings, brokerage actions and a deal in the energy sector.Denbury, the oil company, announced a deal to buy Encore for $3.2bn with Encore shareholders receiving $50 a share, consisting of $15 in cash and $35 in Denbury common stock.Denbury fell 10.3 per cent to $13.09 while Encore rose 20.5 per cent to $44.67.In other earnings news, Humana, the health insurer, posted a 65 per cent rise in third-quarter profit.The company reported earnings of $301.6m, or $1.78 a share, up from $183m, or $1.09 a share, a year before. Revenue rose 8 per cent for the quarter to $7.72bn and the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $37.01.Shares in Loews Corp rose 2.4 per cent to $33.90 after the conglomerate reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit of $469m, or $1.08 a share, beating a forecast of 89 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $144m, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Sysco Corp, the food distributer, recorded an 18 per cent rise in quarterly profit, just above estimates. The stock gained 0.2 per cent to $26.50 as sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.Shares in Clorox rose 0.3 per cent to $59.40 after the maker of bleach products posted a 23 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit, beating estimates.Shares in Motorola rose 5.4 per cent to $9.03 after Citigroup upgraded it to a “buy” from a “hold” and raised the target price to $10.50 ahead of the new Droid cell phone.Nordstrom gained 1.6 per cent to $32.29 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the retailer to a “buy” from a “hold” with a target price of $45 from $36on expectations of better store sales in October.

However, after gaining strongly on Thursday, materials led Friday’s selling.Alcoa, the aluminium company, lost 3.2 per cent to $13.27 while Freeportthe gold and copper miner, fell 3.7 per cent to $63.65.This saw the S&P close 0.9 per cent down at 1,004.09. It lost 0.6 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.8 per cent to 9,321.40, a weekly drop of 0.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,985.52, finishing the week 0.7 per cent lower.“We have had a string of better-than-expected data but over the past two days it has been very disappointing,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “And we think the market will continue to be dictated by the direction of future economic data.”The falls in consumer stocks dragged two leading clothing retailers lower, even after they both raised full-year forecasts following their quarterly results.JC Penney lost ground in spite of making a narrower loss than expected. Its higher profit forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations and the stock declined 6.2 per cent to $31.29.Nordstrom also fell as its new forecast could not counteract slightly lower profit than expected.The shares gave up 6.4 per cent to $27.87. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “People have assumed that the recovery will be consumer led. We have known for many months that that won’t be the case, but it is only just sinking in.”But Abercrombie & Fitch, which has suffered recently as cheaper competitors have eaten into its share of the teenage fashion market, bounced 3.9 per cent to $34.25. Its quarterly loss did not deter investors, who focused on some encouraging sales trends.Boeing slid further than the rest of the industrial sector after the company encountered fresh problems with its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.Boeing said it had stopped work on two parts of the fuselage but denied this would further delay the launch, which is already two years behind schedule. The shares fell 3.8 per cent to $44.87.Elsewhere, struggling DVD rental chain Blockbuster was one of the day’s heaviest fallers after it made a worse loss than expected on weak sales.The results forced
management to cut the full-year forecast and the shares shed 16.3 per cent to 72 cents.Autodesk the graphic design company, beat analysts’ estimates on slightly stronger revenues than expected, which were particularly strong in Asia-Pacific and emerging countries. Its shares rose 4.9 per cent to $25.38."
108;JWN;Nordstrom;2009-07-16T18:59:44Z;Suppliers braced for CIT funding crisis;;Joe’s Jeans, an upmarket denim brand, sells to Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and other leading US retailers, with sales last year of almost $70m.But Joe’s also depends on advances of up to $6m made against its inventory by the commercial services unit of CIT, the troubled bank.With the lender on the brink of bankruptcy, Joe’s is one of potentially thousands of small and medium sized suppliers that will need to look elsewhere for the credit they need to survive, risking disruption of supplies to retailers.The National Retail Federation, the leading US retail industry group, unsuccessfully called on the federal government this week to step in to help CIT.“Our primary concern is the retail supply chain,” says Mallory Duncan, the NRF’s general counsel. “If you interrupt the chain by possibly removing CIT as a funding source then you have vendors that aren’t able to produce goods and that’s going to create a crimp in the retail supply chain.”CIT provided more than $18bn in trade and vendor financing last year, much in the form of “factoring” arrangements like the one with Joe’s Jeans, which provide funds to cover operational costs while awaiting payments from retailers.Mr Duncan says that, in the short term, vendors will have to seek funding either from other banks – at a time when financing is “extraordinarily difficult” to obtain – or from the retailers themselves, which would have to draw on their own credit lines with the banks at a time when they are themselves fighting to retain cash.Doug Hart, a retail consultant at BDO Seidman, noted that, while factoring arrangements could be transferred to another provider with comparative ease, a bankruptcy at CIT would create questions about completing the current financing cycles.“[The] question is what happens in the interim period . . . if you have a cycle of receivables that you loose. A lot of sectors they play in, such as apparel and footware and so on are really hurting right now. These are customers that might not be able to afford that,” Mr Hart says.William Sussman, president of Financo, an investment bank that specialises in retail, says that, as the leading player in the factoring business, CIT had detailed expertise in assessing probable credit risks. Its failure, he says, will “raise the price and lower the availability of capital to the industry”.“For the strong retailers, they will be able to weather that, but for the smaller ones, just getting by it could be a problem.”Both the International Franchisee Association, representing business franchise operators, and the American Small Business League lobbied unsuccessfully for support for CIT, reflecting the group’s role in small business financing.Its national business partners also include Yum Brands Dunkin Donuts fast-food restaurants, with which it has a franchise financing relationship, and Dell Computers, with CIT currently providing about 25 per cent of the consumer finance for Dell’s direct sales to US customers.CIT has also been the biggest issuer of loans backed by the US Small Business Administration, making 1,195 loans through the SBA’s programme last year, totalling $766.6m.Marc Grossman, CEO of Joe’s Jeans, told investors on Wednesday night that he was confident his company would be able to shift factoring agreements to a new provider, with adequate cash available to cover what could be a 30-day gap.However, he also warned of the possible impact of CIT’s demise on small independent boutique operators, “mom and pop” stores that account for about 10 per cent of Joe’s Jean’s sales.“I’m sure some would go away if they didn’t have access to capital and couldn’t switch over to Wells Fargo or one of those fellows,” he said.

Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers. The bank started coverage on Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest, recommending a price target of $9 after recent selling pressure.The shares climbed 0.5 per cent to $5.88.Morgan Stanley also upgraded shares in Continental Airlines, saying it was a likely survivor from the fall-out in the industry.There was some pressure on the stock from news on Wednesday evening that its revenue per seat may have fallen more than 20 per cent in June compared with a year earlier. But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders. The shares lost 12.3 per cent to $33.46."

They failed to recover fully during the rest of the week as moderate gains on Thursday were followed by another dip on Friday.Further worries about consumer activity came on Friday after two leading clothing retailers announced worse results than expected.JC Penney reported profit marginally below consensus estimates and lowered its full-year estimates, saying it expected consumer spending to remain weak. The shares lost 0.4 per cent to $26.54.Designer brand name Abercrombie & Fitch lost ground after posting a steeper than expected first quarter loss. Its shares fell 4.2 per cent to $26.10.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, bucked the trend, beating analysts’ estimates in spite of falling sales. It raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 7.8 per cent to $22.58.Analysts warned that sales figures gave a more accurate picture of consumer behaviour than surveys on confidence.The economic outlook saw equities markets fall on Friday, on a day of raised volatility, as many investors moved to cover their positions on options, which were about to expire.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.1 per cent to 882.88 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 8,268.64 points.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed, finding relative strength in technology stocks, which fell during the early part of the week. The index dropped 0.5 per cent to 1,680.14 points, taking it to its first weekly loss in 10. The three main market measures fell between 3.3-5 per cent in the week.Energy stocks were some of the heaviest fallers on the day as the price of oil fell
3 per cent. Chevron lost 2 per cent to $65.88 and ExxonMobil gave up 0.9 per cent to $69.11.Industrial and materials stocks outperformed after figures showed that manufacturing output in New York state is falling at a slower rate than expected.Financial stocks were weak on worries over the economic outlook. This weakness affected insurers even after several companies were approved for bail-out funds from the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).After early gains, insurers fell during the broader sell-off. Hartford, which has approval for $3.4bn, fell 1 per cent to $14.60, while Lincoln National which may take $2.5bn, lost 0.7 per cent to $16.12.Technology companies have proved stable this year, and have outperformed every other sector.That changed during the week as investors banked profits and shares fell, but the sector held up amid the wider sell-off on Friday, losing 0.1 per cent to 262.15 points."
111;JWN;Nordstrom;2009-01-14T23:30:24Z;US banking shares slide to 13-year low;;Banking stocks slid to a 13- year low on Wednesday as the wider market suffered from the latest in a series of sharp sell-offs that have now erased all of the gains made over the past six weeks.Not a single stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was spared in the broad-based retreat, although financials were once again were among the heaviest hit.The KBW Bank Index dropped 7.5 per cent, beneath a nadir hit last November to its lowest level since 1995.A further epic loss in the shares of Citigroup, this time of 23.2 per cent, pushed them to $4.53, their lowest level since the bank’s rescue towards the end of last year.Concerns that Citi’s “financial supermarket” model could become a thing of the past weighed on the wider financial sector, which fell 5.7 per cent overall to lead the retreat.The sell-off came following its deal to spin off Smith Barney, its US brokerage business, into a joint venture controlled by Morgan Stanley, which dived 8.9 per cent to $17.19.Wells Fargo lost 5.4 per cent to $23.07 after Atlantic Equities warned the group was short of at least $10bn in common equity and said the sustainability of its dividend was under question. Richard Staite, analyst, downgraded his view to “underweight”.RBC analysts said: “At Wells, and across the industry in general, it is our view that the influx of [Troubled Assets Relief Program] funds has not been deployed ­efficiently due to a lack of loan demand, low securities yields, and the desire for excess capital.”Bank of America shed 4.2 per cent to $10.20 after analysts at Barclays became the latest to forecast a fourth- quarter loss, while JPMorgan Chaselost 1.7 per cent to $25.91 ahead of results on Thursday.A profit warning from Deutsche Bank and a Morgan Stanley analyst forecast that HSBC would have to raise fresh capital and halve its dividend added to US investor concerns over the state of the sector.Among the hard-hit regionals, Huntington Bancshares sank 16.2 per cent to $4.95 following a management shake-up.The S&P 500 closed down 3.4 per cent at 842.62, its lowest closing level since December 1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average took its bad run to a sixth consecutive loss, off 2.9 per cent at 8,200.14 while the Nasdaq Composite Index finished 3.7 per cent lower at 1,489.64.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped 13.6 per cent and was earlier above 50 for the first time in nearly a month.Consumer discretionary stocks came under heavy pressure, off 2.3 per cent overall, after Commerce Department figures showed US retail sales dropped twice as much as forecast last month.Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch were among the hardest hit, down 8.2 per cent at $12.04 and 6.3 per cent to $19.48 respectively, as investors fretted the poor sector sales during the vital Christmas shopping month augured badly for the rest of the year.“The holiday season was truly disastrous,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics.Telecoms stocks fell 2.7 per cent overall after Nortel Networks – a key supplier for the sector – filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.Meanwhile, a host of other US companies report earnings in the forthcoming days. Investors fear bleak figures from aluminium group Alcoa this week are merely the precursor to a glut of heavy losses during earnings season.Technology also did poorly, off 3.5 per cent ahead of results due on Thursday from Intel, which was down 4.3 per cent at $13.08.The selling pressure came even though the average rate for US mortgages fell to its lowest level since records began in 1990, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Homebuilders were 7.5 per cent lower overall.Among them, Lennar dropped 8.8 per cent to $7.89 after the company said it would pursue legal action against Barry Minkow and his company, Fraud Discovery.Energy stocks also did poorly, down 4.3 per cent overall as oil prices retreated back beneath the $38 a barrel level. All ten economic sectors were in the red, and although traditionally defensive stocks held up better than the wider market, they still sustained sizeable losses. The healthcare and utilities sectors were each off 1.5 per cent.
112;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
113;JWN;Nordstrom;2009-01-06T22:43:09Z;US stocks shrug off glum data;;"Technology stocks were among the big favourites on Wall Street on Tuesday as the market hit a fresh two-month high.Investors snapped up cash-rich blue chips in the sector, which rallied 3 per cent overall after more gloomy economic data provided fresh insight into the depth of the recession. Cisco and Intel climbed 4 per cent to $17.79 and 3.1 per cent to $15.37, respectively.Western Union jumped 8.5 per cent to $15.76 after Morgan Keegan upgraded its view of the money-transfer stock to “outperform”.“The global remittance market place is likely less sensitive to an economic downturn than Western Union shares currently reflect,” wrote the analysts.Microsoft added 1.2 per cent to $20.76 following the release of Xbox sales figures, while Ciena soared 18.6 per cent to $8.40 on a tip from Barclays, which cited confidence in the communications equipment maker’s cash balance.However, Apple’s recent good run came to an end. The shares had gained further ground in the morning session after Oppenheimer analysts, who last month removed their price target on the stock, upgraded their view to “outperform” in the wake of Steve Jobs’s health update.Yet they later fell back to finish 1.7 per cent lower at $93.02 as the Macworld conference drew to a close without any blockbuster product announcements.The benchmark S&P 500 index overcame the previous session’s losses, up 0.8 per cent to close at 934.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 9,015.10 and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,652.38.Yet traditionally defensive sectors lost ground as investors dipped their toes into riskier stocks in areas such as retail. Healthcare, consumer staples and utilities – which outperformed the wider market last year – were the worst performing sectors.Celgene was among the poorest performing healthcare stocks, down 7.2 per cent to $50.47 after Baird downgraded its recommendation on the biopharmaceutical group to “neutral” due in part to concerns over Revlimid, a blood cancer drug.Johnson and Johnson dipped 0.6 per cent to $59.69 after Citigroup warned the coming year “looks more challenging than we realised”. Wall Street’s earnings estimates appear to be “too high”, wrote Matthew Dodds, Citi analyst, unless the group “either cuts expenses dramatically and/or does a massive stock buy-back”.The energy sector, which pared the market’s losses in the previous session, performed well in the morning session after oil prices hit the $50 a barrel level. Yet it later lost ground to enjoy only modest gains as crude fell back.Devon Energy eased 0.9 per cent to $70.37 after Barclays downgraded its
recommendation on the stock from “over weight” to “equal weight”.Thomas Driscoll, Barclays analyst, said the group had only hedged about 10 per cent of its 2009 natural gas production. “Devon is nearly alone among the large cap producers in that it has not hedged a substantial portion,” he wrote, “and as such could be most exposed to falling natural gas prices.”Prudential Financial was among several strong performers among insurers, up 14.9 per cent to $35.11 after Standard & Poor’s lifted its price target from $30 to $40. Bret Howlett, analyst, noted that the shares had more than doubled since they hit an all-time low in November.“The sharp rebound is a reflection of improved investor sentiment in the life insurance group as the spreads have tightened in the credit markets, the equity markets have rallied off of lows, and capital positions appear to be holding up,” he wrote.The wider financial sector gained 1.9 per cent overall.Elsewhere, Best Buy advanced 4.2 per cent to $31.25 after the electronics retailer disclosed plans to sell used iPhones for $50 less than new models. Among other consumer discretionary stocks to do well, Office Depot and Nordstrom added 8.1 per cent to $4 and 4.7 per cent to $15.91, respectively.The homebuilding sector rallied 5.1 per cent even though figures showed pending home sales sank to a seven-year low in November.The market had earlier trimmed more sizeable gains after Commerce Department figures showed US factory orders fell by 4.6 per cent in November, much more than expected and the fourth consecutive monthly decline."

Nordstrom, another department store chain, bounced 6.5 per cent to $13.98 and the retail sector stood 1.8 per cent higher overall, helping pare the market’s losses.“It’s a good sign for the retailers, that’s for sure,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. He said the move could be a sign that banks were “being a little bit less restrictive”.The market overall failed to hold gains enjoyed in the previous session, when the Federal Reserve’s historic move to cut rates to virtually zero spurred a 5.1 per cent rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent on Wednesday at 904.42 after drifting between positive and negative territory throughout the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.1 per cent lower at 8,824.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent weaker at 1,579.31.Trading was largely muted, however, as investors digested the effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate policy.Financials finished 1.3 per cent lower overall. Shares in Morgan Stanley lost as much as 8.3 per cent in the morning session as the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss that was wider than even the most bearish predictions. The figures prompted Moody’s to downgrade the bank’s senior debt rating.Yet the shares finished 2.3 per cent higher as traders were encouraged by the bank’s attempt to reduce its leveraged capital structure. Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, lifted his price target on the stock to $18.Goldman Sachs, which jumped 14.4 per cent in the previous session following its fourth-quarter results, added a further 3.7 per cent to $78.78.However, regional banks, off 2.3 per cent overall, underperformed the wider financial sector after Fifth Third’s move to cut its fourth-quarter dividend to 1 cent a share sparked concerns others may be required to take similar action. Fifth Third fell 6 per cent to $7.51 while KeyCorp lost 4 per cent to $8.33.Among other consumer stocks, ConAgra and General Mills jumped 8 per cent to $16.25 and 0.2 per cent to $61.35, respectively, on the back of better-than-expected second-quarter profits.Newell Rubbermaid was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, pushed 27.3 per cent lower to $9.58 by a profit warning that prompted analysts at BMO Capital Markets to question whether the company would retain its dividend.Investors did not appear reassured by plans from the maker of Sharpie pens, among other products, to cut up to 10 per cent of non-
manufacturing jobs.Meanwhile, the materials sector provided the market with support, up 0.1 per cent overall. Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold advanced 4.5 per cent to $26.01 as gold prices enjoyed strong gains.However, the energy sector came under selling pressure as US crude prices neared $40 in spite of Opec’s production cut.Elsewhere, Apple continued its bad run, down a further 6.6 per cent to $89.16, after the withdrawal of Steve Jobs, chief executive, from the group’s main event of the year prompted Oppenheimer to downgrade its view of the stock to “perform”.“It’s past time for Apple to either disclose the state of his health or elaborate a viable plan for eventually transferring power,” the analysts wrote, removing their price target. “Until such time, we can no longer continue to recommend Apple as a long-term investment.”Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Adobe afforded the technology sector scant comfort.Shares in the software group were dragged 2.8 per cent lower to $21.69 as the wider sector fell 1.7 per cent.Barclays noted the company did not give guidance for next year. “We believe the near-term environment will continue to pressure the top-line,” wrote the analysts, although they maintained their “overweight” stance."
115;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-11-21T20:00:50Z;Luxury goods;;"Just weeks ago the world of bling and posh frocks clung to hopes for a soft landing. A crash now looks more likely. Sales at Richemont, owner of Cartier, rose 16 per cent year on year in constant currency terms in the half-year to September 30, but fell 2 per cent in October. Burberry’s like-for-like sales also turned negative last month. Bulgari has issued a profit warning, the first among luxury brands, while Saks, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, top-end US department stores,have all seen double-digit sales declines.Bain & Co now forecasts that luxury goods sales will fall by as much as 7 per cent next year. Some worst-case forecasts see 2009 sales in developed markets reverting to 2005-06 levels.Where past recessions hit the toiling masses harder, the rich are this time sharing the pain. Even more corrosive than numerical falls in wealthy consumers’ property and portfolio values is the psychological impact. No one feels much like spending; ostentation is out.Emerging market sales – source of about four-fifths of luxury brands’ growth – are also dropping. Growth is slowing in China. Russia’s oligarchs are worth $250bn less than a few months ago, while India’s top 40 Bollygarchs have lost $212bn – or 60 per cent of their combined wealth – over the past year.One saving grace for luxury merchants is the dollar’s rebound against the euro and yen, which may flatter reported figures next year. With the sector on an average of about 11 times forecast current-year earnings, and names such as PPR and Burberry in mid-single digits, luxury goods shares – unlike their products – now look cheap. But the only buyers are likely to be those who can take a very long-term view.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

116;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-11-18T17:56:30Z;Burberry swept up in steep US downturn;;"Burberry, the luxury-goods brand, has been swept up in the steep deterioration in US retail sales after recording six months of solid growth.US department stores, including Saks, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, have reported double-digit sales declines in recent weeks as mid-to-high-end products were crossed off consumers’ shopping lists.Burberry said its like-for-like sales had swung to negative territory since the end of September in spite of continued progress outside the US.“In US retail, a higher proportion of sales is now going through outlets at a lower gross margin,” the company said. “In US wholesale, Burberry anticipates lower department store re-orders.”Adjusted full-year profits would be towards the lower end of expectations if trading continued at current levels, the company said.A consensus of analysts’ pre-tax profit forecasts before the statement was £200m, with a range of £160m to £215m.In the six months to September 30, Burberry announced an increase in pre-tax profit of 1 per cent to £97m on sales that rose 20 per cent to £539m. Diluted earnings per share rose from 14.9p to 17p. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.35p.Burberry’s sales, which are flattered at a reported level by their exposure to stronger currencies than sterling, were 21 per cent higher through its own stores or 14 per cent on an underlying basis; wholesale sales were up 23 per cent or 15 per cent underlying; and licensing revenue was unchanged but down 3 per cent on an underlying basis.Although the profit increase was slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations, shares in Burberry fell 22¾p, or 11 per cent, to 177½p.Angela Ahrendts, chief executive, noted that the company had achieved its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth but acknowledged the weakening economic outlook since September had brought about a reversal in its fortunes.“We paid a lot more attention to battening down the hatches on costs,” Stacey Cartwright, finance director, said of the half year.Burberry said planned savings would amount to £15m-£20m in the next financial year. Further options for cutting costs were under consideration with details to be announced in January.John Guy, analyst at MF Global, said the company was outperforming the market and could be an attractive acquisition for a larger luxury-goods groups.“We have high conviction that trade bidders such as Coach and Richemont will bid for Burberry in an effort to maximise sourcing and supply synergies and extend product sales diversity,” he said."
117;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-11-14T22:09:27Z;Wall Street ends a wild week lower;;Another highly volatile session on Friday that rounded off a wild week ended sharply in the red as investors took fright at the latest round of bleak economic data.The market remained downtrodden for much of the session after retail sales figures showed a worse-than-expected 2.8 per cent drop last month, the latest dramatic sign of a collapse in consumer spending.Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets said the figures were “even more dire than expected. Let’s not dance about this, the data is awful.”Still, the market crept higher during a false afternoon rally as traders snapped up battered stocks in energy and financial services.That gave way to a sell-off into the close, which some observers said did not augur well for the market as traders did not want to hold on to stock over the weekend.The benchmark S&P 500 index found positive territory less than an hour before the close – only to finish down 4.2 per cent at 873.29.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 3.8 per cent at 8,497.31 and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 5 per cent at 1,516.85.JC Penney and Nordstrom, the department store chains, were among several retail losers and were down 10.4 per cent to $17.27 and 9.4 per cent to $11.74 respectively after the pair cut earnings forecasts.Meanwhile, technology and telecoms came under further pressure. Sun Microsystems escaped the falls, up 1 per cent to $4.12, after the computer server group unveiled plans to cut up to 6,000 jobs. Traders took kindly to the move as it could save the company as much as $800m a year, but feared that it was a symptom of broader malaise across the sector.Qualcomm lost 5.4 per cent to $32.94 after Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, warned of lower sales due to “a sharp pullback” in consumer spending. They were the latest glum developments in the sectors this week, which included a surprise warning from chipmaker Intel.Friday’s declines took the weekly loss for the S&P to 6.2 per cent, for the Dow to 4.5 per cent and for the Nasdaq to 7.9 per cent.Hopes were raised early in the week that China’s $600bn economic stimulus package could help hard-hit material and construction stocks. Yet the relief was short-lived.Three straight days of falls pushed the market below the five-year intraday low hit last month but stocks subsequently bounced in a spectacular rally late on Thursday in the hope the market had set a new bottom. But the gains were short-lived.Financials were the worst-performing sector, off 11.8 per cent overall for the week after the US Treasury reversed course on its plan to mop up toxic mortgage assets. Citigroup hit a 12-year low, down 19.5 per cent for the week at $9.52, and reports on Friday said the bank was to cut at least 10,000 jobs.American Express and CIT Group shed 21 per cent to $19.99 and 15.2 per cent to $4.14 respectively after the pair sought approval to become a bank holding company as well as funding under the government’s recapitalisation programme.As fears over the health of the financial sector heightened, a series of grim developments elsewhere highlighted the bleak prospects facing corporate America in what is expected to be a severe downturn.Technology and retail came under severe pressure on fears that both are particularly vulnerable in a protracted downturn.Best Buy sent a chill through both sectors when the electronics chain warned of a “seismic” slowdown in consumer spending when it slashed annual profit forecasts.The downbeat outlook disappointed traders who had hoped the chain could benefit after smaller rival Circuit City filed for bankruptcy, and its shares shed 13.8 per cent over the week to $22.06.General Motors and Ford lost 31 per cent to $3.01 and 10.9 per cent to $1.80 despite hopes that Washington may save the industry from the brink of collapse. The fall came after Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero on GM.
118;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Kohl’s and Nordstrom cut outlook;;Kohl’s, the price-focused department store, and Nordstrom, purveyor of fashion and shoes to a more upmarket clientele, both cut their full year earnings forecasts on Thursday, illustrating the breadth of the decline in US discretionary consumer spending.Both retailers also reported lower third quarter profits on declining sales. Kohl’s, which operates just over 1,000 stores, reporting a 17 per cent drop in earnings to $160.2m, or 52 cents per diluted share. Net sales dropped 0.6 per cent to $3.8bn, and same store sales were down 6.7 per cent.Nordstrom, which has 169 mostly mall-based department stores, said its net earnings down 57 per cent at $71m, or 33 per diluted share, while total sales fell 8.4 per cent to $1.81bn.Nordstrom said it expected its comparable store sales to fall by 13-16 per cent in the important fourth quarter, and slashed its earnings guidance for the full year to $1.87-$1.97, from its previous guidance of $2.55 to $2.65, issued in August.The retailer also said it would reduce its planned capital expenditure, including on plans for new or remodelled stores, to $350m from $510m for the current year.Blake Nordstrom, the retailer’s president, told analysts: ”We are in unprecedented times and customers are lacking confidence”.Kohl’s said it was expecting same store sales in the fourth quarter to drop by between 8-12 per cent. It also reduced its full year earnings guidance, to $2.69-$2.84 per share, down from its previous forecast of $3.02-$3.18 per share.Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chief executive officer, said: “we expect the holiday season to be the most difficult economic environment for the consumer in years”.“Shoppers can look forward to frequent sales events [and] aggressive discounts on popular merchandise earlier in the season,” he said of the retailer’s stores.Kohl’s said it still remained committed to opening 50 new stores next year, on top of the 75 it has opened so far this year - 46 of them in October. It also said it hoped to be able to pick up marketshare as a result of the troubles facing other rival retailers, such as Mervyn’s, the low-price department store currently going through liquidation.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chairman, said the company believed it “had started to see what we think is the start of a consolidation across many retail sectors,” with the bankruptcy filings of Circuit City, Mervyn’s and Linens ‘n Things.He said the retailer believed it could increase sales “through discplined acquisition of selected real estate across the country as other chains enter bankruptcy or liquidation.”Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday reported that its net income increased 6.6 per cent in the third quarter, on a 7.5 per cent increase in revenues to $97.6bn. The discount retailer has also said it will use its current financial strength to take advantage of any opportunities arising from the challenges facing the US retail sector.
119;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-10-17T20:35:05Z;Confidence plunges among US consumers;;US consumer confidence has fallen more sharply this month than in any month since records began in 1978, a widely followed survey showed on Friday, raising fresh fears about consumer spending.The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell from 70.3 in September to 57.5 in October, well below economists’ expectations.The sharp deterioration raises the danger that US households, scared by the extraordinary events of recent weeks and weighed down by the fall in stock and house prices, will retrench, sending the economy into what could be a deep recesssion.“People are really terrified and this has the potential to have a big impact on spending,” Frederic Mishkin, a professor at Columbia University and former governor of the Federal Reserve, told the Financial Times prior to the release of the Michigan figures.The poor sentiment comes as banks and finance companies cut back on consumer credit – in particular car loans – amid growing evidence that people are struggling to meet their payments.Underlining the grim mood, Linens N Things, once the second largest US home furnishings chain, launched liquidation sales at its 371 remaining stores on Friday. VF Corporation, owner of clothing brands including Wrangler and The North Face, also slashed fourth-quarter revenue forecasts, saying the financial crisis and economy had taken “a heavy toll on consumer confidence and spending in many markets around the world”.The company, which supplies retailers such as Wal-Mart and Nordstrom, said the second half of September had been a “turning point” for sentiment.Separate data showed that US housing starts fell again in September to their lowest level in nearly half a century, indicating that the housing sector is still far from bottoming out.Builders started construction on new homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 817,000 last month, the weakest level of new building since January 1991. Excluding that month, starts have never been lower since records began in 1959. Permits, which signal future housing activity, were down 8.3 per cent.“If you thought it could not go much lower, think again,” said Alan Ruskin, strategest at RBS Global Banking and Markets.The US consumer pull-back comes as banks and finance companies cut back on consumer credit, in particular car loans, amid growing evidence that consumers are struggling to meet payments.On stock markets, the S&P 500 fell 0.63 per cent in New York. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 rebounded 2.8 per cent and ended the week with a 5 per cent gain. In the UK, the FTSE 100 rose 5.2 per cent to 4,063, extending this week’s gain to 3.3 per cent.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 4.2 per cent. US Treasury bonds were essentially unchanged.The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-month loans in dollars eased slightly for the fifth consecutive day, sliding 8 basis points to 4.42 per cent.
120;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-10-15T21:24:28Z;US shares plummet again on recession fears;;US stocks plunged yet again on Wednesday on fresh concerns that the vast government intervention in the financial system may not be enough to stem the credit crisis.Fears also persisted that it had in any case come too late to prevent severe and long-lasting recession. Retailers Nordstrom, Macy’s and Bed, Bath & Beyond suffered some of the heaviest falls in the fall-out from grim retail sales data, down 12.4 per cent to $16.54, 17.5 per cent to $8.66 and 11 per cent to $23.89 respectively.In spite of better-than-exexpected corporate earnings in the sector, financials slumped 9 per cent overall.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – which bounced 21.2 per cent and 16.5 respectively in the previous session – retreated 12.8 per cent to $16.23 and 16.3 per cent to $18.13 after Oppenheimer warned that the government’s bank rescue was not a “panacea’’ for all ills.The major indices opened lower and sold off sharply towards the close, a hallmark of recent slumps that traders put down, in part, to another wave of mutual fund redemptions. The S&P 500 closed down 9 per cent at 907.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 7.9 per cent down at 8,577.91 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 8.5 per cent lower at 1,628.33.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 24.8 per cent to 68.78, a figure that indicates severe distress.The bloody retreat over the past two sessions erased virtually all of the gains from Monday, itself the biggest rise since the Depression.Energy and materials were the biggest laggards, down 15.5 and 12.1 per cent respectively, on mounting concerns of a global slowdown. US Steel sank 17.7 per cent to $38.82.“There can be no doubt now that the economy is in recession,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics. “It will be there a while.”Financials took scant comfort from JPMorgan Chase, which fell 5.5 per cent to $38.49, even after its earnings exceeded expectations. Wells Fargo which also did better than forecast, held on to gains for much of the session but closed down 0.5 per cent at $33.35.State Street, one of nine institutions in which the government will take an equity stake, sank 17.4 per cent to $46.83 after the group warned of unrealised off-balance sheet losses.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola was the only stock in the Dow to find positive territory, up 1.1 per cent to $44.21 after the soft drinks group’s quarterly profit compared favourably with a glum outlook from PepsiCo the previous day. PepsiCo lost a further 5.8 per cent to $51.25 after a 11.9 per cent slide in the previous session.Intel’s relatively well received results failed to boost Dell, which lost 10.65 per cent to $12.58.
121;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US high-end retailers battered;;Cut-backs by America’s wealthiest shoppers amid Wall Street’s woes drove down sales at the country’s most exclusive stores in September, according to sales data released on Wednesday by leading retailers.Neiman Marcus, the Dallas-based retailer which operates 64 luxury stores, said comparable sales at its stores fell 15.8 per cent during the month, while its overall revenues fell 11.1 per cent.The retailer’s monthly sales declines are the worst reported by the retailer since September 2002.Neiman Marcus warned last month that it expected its three New York area stores, which include Bergdforf Goodman in Manhattan, to be hit by Wall Street’s troubles ands by a decline in spending by tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar.Its September sales also reflected the hurricanes that affected its Texas stores.Burt Tansky, CEO, said that “based on our September performance and the current economic environment, we expect customer demand will remain weak for an extended period of time”, and warned that the retailer had higher than expected inventory levels.Saks, which derives 20 per cent of its revenue from its flagship store in New York, reported a 10 per cent fall in its comparable sales and a 11.1 per cent fall in total revenues. Nordstrom, which targets a more mainstream affluent customer, reported a 9.6 per cent drop in comparable sales and a 5.8 per cent fall in revenues.Saks said in a statement that it “anticipates the extremely challenging economic environment will continue”, and said it was now expecting sales in the second hald of its fiscal year to drop below its estimate of a low-single digit decline.Blake Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, said that ”the consumer environment has been impacted by events in the financial markets over the past month”, as the retailer lowered its third quarter earnings forecast by 17 cents, to 32 to 37 cents per share.The dramatic slowdown in spending at Neiman, whose holiday gift catalogue this year includes exotic luxury items such as a $60,000 personalised portrait Lego replicas, contrasted with the more robust performance at Wal-Mart and at discount warehouse clubs focused on low cost food and basics.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s stores and supercenters rose 2 per cent during the month, while sales at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores rose 4.6 per cent. Costco and BJ’s, the discount club stores, saw US store sales excluding fuel increase by 6 and 5.6 per cent respectively.Richard Galanti, Costco’s CFO, told investors that the retailer was seeing high double digit sales of food and grocery items, while sales of bigger ticket items such as televisions, jewellery and furniture were declining.Stores more focused on discretionary purchases struggled. Target, the discounter that has a heavy focus on fashion and housewares, saw its comparable sales drop 3 per cent. JC Penney and Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 12.4 per cent and 5.5 per cent. Both retailers cut their third quarter earnings forecasts.Clothing retailers - some of whom report sales on Thursday - have also seen falling sales. American Eagle said its comparable sales were down 6 per cent, and lowered its earnings forecast, while youth brand Zumiez reported a 9 per cent drop.The gloomy same store sales numbers followed consumer spending data released earlier this week by MasterCard Advisors’ Spending Pulse, which reported declines in all sales categories in September.The report, based on MasterCard credit card spending data and estimates of other forms of payment, said sales at speciality retail stores - which include clothing sellers and department stores - fell 7.7 per cent aganst the same period last year, following a 4.1 per cent decline in August.
122;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-09-12T20:40:01Z;Wall Street rattled by Lehman uncertainty;;A highly voltaile week for Wall Street drew to a close with big-name financials continuing to weigh heavily on the market as investors awaited details of Lehman Brothers’ fate.Deepening uncertainty over the investment bank’s ability to raise capital and sell assets prompted concern over the prospects for other high profile institutions, including insurers, investment banks and thrifts.Stand-out stocks continued to endure heavy losses on Friday, which have dragged some to their lowest in more than a decade.American International Group tumbled another 30.8 per cent to $12.14 on Friday. Once the world’s largest insurer by market capitalisation, shares in AIG have lost more than 40 per cent this week.Merrill Lynch slid another 12.3 per cent to $17.05, taking its loss to a third of its value at the start of the week.Meanwhile, shares in Lehman itself fell 13.5 per cent, in part due to doubts over whether the US Treasury would fund a deal. Over the week, shares in the 158-year-old institution have slumped 77.5 per cent.Washington Mutual, which has sustained heavy losses in recent sessions, lost 3.5 per cent on Friday to $2.73 even after the lender said it would set aside less for bad loans in the third quarter. Over the week, it has lost 36 per cent.General Electric, one of the world’s largest insurers of debt, fell 5 per cent on Friday. MBIA, the monoline bond insurer, lost 5.1 per cent, taking its decline over the week to 21.8 per cent.Still, Zions Bancorporation offered at least some comfort to badly hit regional banks after successfully raising capital. The shares rose 11.5 per cent to $37.48 on Friday.The S&P 500 dipped in and out of negative territory throughout the day but had edged up 0.2 per cent at 1,251.70 by the close. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1 per cent at 2,261.27 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 11,421.99.Automotive stocks helped prop up the market on the prospect of low-interest government loans to help the sector. Over the week, General Motors and Ford climbed 21.5 per cent and 11.3 per cent to $13.01 and $4.91, respectively.Material, energy and utility stocks also gained on Friday on the back of rising commodity prices.In a memorable week, the benchmark S&P 500 finished only marginally in positive territory, up 0.1 per cent, even after the government in effect nationalised troubled mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Dow Jones stood 1.2 per cent higher, although the Nasdaq Composite 0.3 per cent lower.“Dour would be a fair word,” said Kevin Quinn, equity sales trader at Stanford Financial, of the mood on trading desks week.Over the course of the week, the market endured its biggest one-day fall of the year and was at one point on course to close at its lowest point of 2008. Yet stocks enjoyed boost later in the week as it emerged that Lehman was actively courting suitors.David Buik, analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Wall Street’s rally was all the more surprising to the degree that it seems unlikely that much of the world’s economies can drag itself up by the bootstraps.”Meanwhile, a slew of negative economic updates – capped on Friday with the release of worse-than-expected retail sales – served as a reminder that investor concerns are not confined to the financial sector.On Friday, retailer Macy was one of the biggest drags on the S&P 500, down 4.8 per cent to $20.81. Nordstrom and JC Penney each lost 4.1 per cent, to $34.07 and $41.43 respectively.Meanwhile, Best Buy fell 3.3 per cent to $44.49 after UBS downgraded the consumer electronics retailer from “buy” to “neutral” due in part to an excess supply of LCD televisions.Oil refiners enjoyed gains as Hurricane Ike headed towards Texas. Over the week, Valero Energy and Tesoro advanced 7.4 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.
123;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-09-04T20:43:33Z;US stocks tumble on poor retail sales figures;;A battered financial sector led Wall Street into bear market territory on Thursday, as Bill Gross, manager of the bond fund Pimco, warned that a “financial tsunami” could ensue if the government failed to support markets.Credit-card groups were among the key casualties as fears grew of rising defaults. American Express fell 5.3 per cent to $38.75 after Lehman Brothers forecast net charge-offs – a measure of uncollectable debts – on its cards would reach to 8.5 per cent of loans by next year.Capital One Financial fell 5.1 per cent to $43.33 after the investment bank cut its price target from $57 to $46.The decline took in the biggest names in corporate America, such as Lehman Brothers, which dropped 10.5 per cent to $15.17 as investors worried about its ability to raise capital ahead of expected poor earnings and writedowns at the end of the month.Bank of America slipped 7.2 per cent to $30.60 as options traders placed bets it would lose almost a quarter of its value by late autumn.Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch dropped 7.5 per cent to $26.21 after reports suggested talks to sell bad loans to Korea Asset Management Corp faced a deadlock.The wider market slumped, falling for the fourth straight session after an unexpected jump in initial jobless claims and sluggish back-to-school retail sales revived concerns about the health of the economy.By the close in New York, each of the 10 industry groups were down more than 1 per cent. The S&P 500, down 3 per cent at 1,236.83, had its biggest one-day fall since early June.The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.2 per cent at 2,2259.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3 per cent lower at 11,188.23.“It’s definitely ugly, that’s for sure,” said Matt King, chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors.The market decline was wide-ranging and took in stocks seen as traditionally defensive. Wal-Mart was one of the only exceptions as down-trading consumers allowed the discounter to escape a retail decline.Same-store sales beat expectations, helping the shares hold steady at $59.78.The retail decline was led by TJX Companies, down 7.4 per cent at $34.07, Abercrombie & Fitch, which lost 6.8 per cent to $50.99, Limited Brands down 6.2 per cent to $20.70, and Nordstrom, down 4 per cent at $31.99.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said: “Back-to-school selling was sluggish [during] the first three weeks of August and picked up some toward the end of the month as consumers are shopping closer to need.”The downward momentum swamped news of improved productivity in the second quarter.Industrials and materials each fell more than 3 per cent. Terex, the maker of construction and mining equipment, was one of the biggest casualties, after cutting its sales and profits forecast for the year. The shares tumbled 19.7 per cent to $38.02.Caterpillar was another key laggard, down 5.6 per cent at $63.94.Steel stocks were shunned after Goldman Sachs issued a more bearish outlook on the sector in a wide-ranging sector note. It said: “A rising US dollar, ‘China fear’ and sharply falling scrap prices have shaken investor confidence in [the] sustainability of [the] steel cycle.”AK Steel shed 11.1 per cent to $40.84, Allegheny Technologies dipped 4.5 per cent to $44.18 and US Steel fell 5.1 per cent to $112.67.Technology stocks – which led Wall Street lower the previous day – endured another decline.Ciena dropped 24.9 per cent to $13.09 after the network equipment maker warned that fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than expected.Oracle fell 6 per cent to $19.93 after a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that its chief executive had failed to turn over evidence that may have proved relevant in a shareholder lawsuit against the company.Microsoft eased 2 per cent to $26.35 after saying it would cut the price of its Xbox 360 console, in the face of competition from Nintendo’s Wii and Sony’s PlayStation 3.Housebuilders were also among the casualties.Hovnanian Enterprises reported its eighth consecutive quarterly loss after nine years of gains, pushing the shares down 17.4 per cent to $6.40.
124;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-09-03T20:47:24Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street lower;;"Technology stocks led Wall Street modestly lower on Wednesday, as another fall in oil prices failed to cheer investors.Earnings downgrades added to wider concerns that technology companies are among the most vulnerable to a slowing global economy.The sector has fallen 3.2 per cent over the past three days, compared to a broader market decline of 2 per cent, a fall that has taken in bellwether Intel, down 4.6 to $21.54 on Wednesday.Corning, which makes glass for flat-screen and high-definition TVs, slid 12.6 per cent to $17.05 after the company cut third-quarter sales and profit forecasts, blaming an industry-wide supply glut.MEMC also lost ground after the maker of silicon wafers for the semiconductor industry noted ongoing softness in demand from some customers. It fell 11.9 per cent to $41.48, while the broader semiconductor sub-sector lost 4.6 per cent.Linear Technology shed 4.1 per cent to $30.94 after Goldman Sachs removed the chipmaker from its buy list.Google lost 0.2 per cent to $464.41 after unveiling a new, free web browser to compete with Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. Microsoft edged down 0.74 per cent to $26.90In the broader market, the S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,274.98 in a volatile session, weighed down by a gloomy economic update from the Federal Reserve.The Nasdaq lost 0.7 per cent at 2,333.73, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 11,532.88Chris Watling, chief executive of Longview Economics, said markets seemed “likely to continue falling” in the short term.Oil prices dropped for the fourth day in a row on Wednesday, losing 36 cents to $109.35 a barrel, which again took their toll on commodity stocks.Materials came under pressure after analysts at Lehman Brothers said that “a rebound in US and European steel equities appears unlikely despite the attractive valuations…[because] buyer behaviour poses a serious threat to steel prices.”AK Steel fell 5 per cent to $45.53 and Nucor lost 0.5 per cent at $48.84.Among the oil-related stocks to suffer declines, BJ Services and Halliburton fell 5.2 per cent to $24.07 and 3.3 per cent to $41.33, respectively.Still, the oil price had a mixed effect on the consumer discretionary and consumer goods sectors on Wednesday. They gained 0.6 per cent and lost 0.1 per cent, respectively, in spite of positive retail sales data.Media companies were the leading fallers in the consumer discretionary sector after some analyst downgrades and reports that

Nordstrom climbed 5.47 per cent at $33.33 and Dillard’s gained 3.07 per cent at $13.45.Coca-Cola fell 0.6 per cent to $51.66 after the soft-drinks maker agreed to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group for about $2.3bn.Staples rose 1.66 per cent to $25.18 after its second-quarter profits – although 16 per cent lower– were no worse than expected.Financials pared early losses, buoyed by some good news from the bond insurer regulators, which approved a plan by Ambac Financial Group to move funds into a new municipal bond insurer called Connie Lee. Ambac jumped 22.4 per cent to $8.65.However, First Horizon fell 0.4 per cent to $11.74 after the Tennessee bank said write-offs for bad loans could be higher this year than forecast.

125;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;JC Penney suffers as shoppers cut back;;JC Penney, the mainstream department store chain, on Friday became the latest mid-range US retailer to report a fall in profits, as consumers cut back on purchases or opt instead for cheaper discount stores.The retailer’s second-quarter net income decreased 35.7 per cent to $117m, while sales fell 2.8 per cent to $4.28bn.Earlier this week Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, Kohl’s and Nordstrom all reported declining profits and sales.The performance of the mid-tier stores contrasted sharply with this week’s strong results from Wal-Mart’s Supercenters and discount stores, which reported increased traffic and an increase in transaction size. Its US store division reported a 10.8 per cent increase in operating profits, with net sales up 8.5 per cent at $64bn.TJX, which operates discount fashion stores, also reported strong results this week.Despite the stronger performance of discount outlets, executives at Macy’s and Nordstrom both maintained that their stores were suffering more from the general slowdown demand, rather than a move by customers to shop at cheaper outlets.Karen Hoguet, chief financial officer at Macy’s told investors that “we don’t think that [trading down] is what is happening. We just think customers are buying less”.Blake Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, said that the fall in sales at its up-market fashion stores reflected a “highly promotional” environment.“Customers are more cautious today. However, we see no evidence that they are trading down.”The leading US retailers are currently waging an aggressive battle for “back to school” sales, the second most important shopping season after the Christmas holidays. JC Penney, for instance, is launching special “doorbuster” sales this weekend, and offering free shipping for online orders.But Mike Ullman, Penney’s chief executive, said that the company was facing customers who were often already at the limit of their consumer credit, and that this had not been significantly affected by the receipt of federal stimulus tax rebates in the second quarter.“Consumer credit is at high levels. The stimulus package may have played that down a bit, but most of the stimulus package went to the increase in fuel prices,” he said.
126;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wal-Mart’s sales provide bright spot;;Wal-Mart provided some rare good news from the US consumer on Thursday, delivering surprisingly strong sales for June as retail spending was boosted by federal tax rebates.In a sign that consumers were trading down to cheaper stores amid soaring oil and food prices, same-store sales at Wal-Mart’s US stores rose 5.8 per cent, excluding fuel, above its own expectations of a 2-4 per cent rise.The increase eclipsed the strong growth seen across the industry fuelled by the tax rebates. US same-store sales in June rose an average of 4 per cent, according to consultant firm Retail Metrics. The data beat forecasts by the most since September 2003. Analysts had expected 2.6 per cent.Wal-Mart had mounted a major advertising campaign to let consumers know that they could cash their rebate cheques at its stores and the company said it had benefited from the government’s attempt to boost consumer spending.Industry sales were also boosted by warm weather, which lifted summer seasonal merchandise sales, as well as heavy price-cutting and promotions.Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose in June across all of its merchandise but the strongest growth came in the grocery, entertainment and health business lines. Net sales were up 11.5 per cent, including a 16.9 per cent rise in international sales and a 10.1 per cent jump in Wal-Mart’s domestic sales. The strong international sales were driven in part by results from Asda in the UK, which grew faster than the market because of higher customer traffic, the company said.Wal-Mart raised its profit forecast for the second quarter by two cents to 84 cents a share.“The key story is that the rebate cheques finally kicked in,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. “They started to flow at the beginning of May, but gas prices were still rising fast then.”Wal-Mart said post-rebate outlook remained cloudy but it expected same-store sales to grow 2-4 per cent in July.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 9 per cent jump in same-store sales in June in the US and an 11 per cent rise including its international business. Analysts had expected an 8.1 per cent advance in US sales.As the rebate spending wanes, expectations are that spending will slow. “We’re sceptical that people will keep spending and we expect a very tough time for retailers over the rest of the year,” said Mr Perkins.
127;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-03-10T20:45:54Z;US stocks slump amid risk aversion;;Wall Street stocks slumped on Monday, amid heightened volatility, as risk aversion sent equities spinning to their lowest levels in 19 months.Financials were sold on growing evidence that credit market turmoil is causing margin calls at investment firms. Among the biggest fallers was Bear Stearns whose shares sank to their lowest level in five years on rumours – which it denied – that the bank was facing liquidity troubles.Energy-sensitive sectors including industrials and transport laboured as crude oil prices hit a record level of $107.90 a barrel and traders took profits in the materials sector as metals prices cooled.The S&P 500 closed 1.6 per cent lower at 1,273.38, leaving the index foundering at its lowest level since August 2006. The S&P stood on the cusp of a bear market, having fallen 18.6 per cent since its October peak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 11,740.15 in spite of good day for McDonald’s which posted strong February sales figures. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2 per cent to 2,169.34. The renewed market skittishness drove the CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer, 6.9 per cent higher to 29.38, its highest in more than a month.Economic fears once again weighed on the market after Friday’s dismal jobs report increased the odds that the US could experience a recession. Although a weak employment market raised the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates again, this prospect – and the announcement of an extra $200bn in one-month bank funds – failed to quell market unease.Fed intervention could come sooner than next week, according to Goldman Sachs, which told clients it “could not rule out an inter-meeting [rate] cut”.Banking stocks beat a retreat after Morgan Stanley cut its 2008 earnings estimates on a range of large-cap banks, citing weaker financial markets.Citigroup‘s shares fell below $20 for the first time in 10 years, ending the session down 5.8 per cent at $19.69. Bank of America lost 3.9 pe r cent to $35.31.Lehman Brothers fell 7.3 per cent to $42.98 in spite of announcing plans to lay off 5 per cent of its workforce.Bear Stearns fell as much as 14 per cent, the lowest since 2003, as rumours that the bank faced a liquidity shortfall rattled the market. Alan Greenberg, chairman of the executive committee, told CNBC the rumours were “totally ridiculous”. The shares closed down 11.1 per cent at $62.30.“The entire brokerage sector is getting crushed. It’s not a pretty place to be,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.JPMorgan warned late last week that a “systemic credit crunch” could cost US banks $325bn in capital due to a sharp deterioration in the mortgage market.Others were even more bearish: “An enormous wave of defaults, foreclosures and auctions is just beginning to hit the US. We believe it will get so bad that large-scale federal government intervention is likely,” said Whitney Tilson, managing partner of T2 Partners.Mortgage lender Thornburg Mortgage fell 60.3 per cent to $0.70 after it failed to meet $610m in margin calls last week.Meanwhile, another mortgage firm Countrywide Financial sank to a new low of $4.36, down 14 per cent, following reports that the company was one of several lenders facing a fraud investigation by the FBI.A Barron’s report that Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage agency, could face a bail-out prompted its shares to drop 13 per cent to $19.81. Bear Stearns’ analysts said the report lacked a “complete or balanced picture” of Fannie’s finances. Another big faller was Ambac Financial, the troubled bond insurer, which gave up 23.3 per cent to $7.29 following its dilutive share sale last week.McDonald’s rose 2.9 per cent to $53.80 after it announced an 11.7 per cent increase in global same-store sales in February.Goldman Sachs upgraded department store operators JC Penney, down 1.4 per cent at $40.42, and Nordstrom, up 0.2 per cent at $32.81, from “neutral” to “buy”.Wal-Mart slipped 2.1 per cent to $48.885 after Goldman removed the company from a conviction buy list.
128;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-03-06T15:29:41Z;Wal-Mart sales beat forecasts;;Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said its February sales beat its own forecast, in a sign that US shoppers are “trading down” in the face of economic pressures.Wal-Mart said sales at its US stores and Sam’s Club discount warehouses open at least a year rose 2.6 per cent during the month. Wall Street analysts had on average been predicting a 1.1 per cent increase.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, said comparable sales in grocery, health and wellness and entertainment - Wal-Mart’s three biggest categories - again outperformed competitors during the month.“We’re very pleased with the way customers responded to our merchandise offerings and the ongoing ‘save money, live better’ messaging across our US stores,” he said in a statement.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s rival Target, which aims at more middle-class customers, rose just 0.5 per cent during the month, in line with its forecasts.Family Dollar, which operates over 6,000 small hard discount stores, also beat expectations with a 1.5 per cent increase in comparable sales.Sales at JC Penney, the low-cost department store that targets Middle America, fell 6.7 per cent, worse than management had forecast. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 3.8 per cent.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales rose 2 per cent for February, beating its forecast of a 1.2 per cent rise. Last year, the index rose 2.6 per cent. However, February’s performance outstripped the 0.4 and 0.2 per cent reported in December and January.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said that while 2 per cent “is not going to make investors take to the streets and jump for joy, it has to be a sigh of relief for retailers and investors alike, as it bucked the recent decline trend”.In a further indication of pressures among more affluent shoppers, Nordstrom, the speciality fashion store, reported its third successive decline in monthly comparable store sales, with a 3.3 per cent fall. Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, both reported on Wednesday that they were seeing signs of a slowdown affecting even their more affluent customers.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, has stopped issuing monthly same-store sales figures. It recently announced plans to reorganise its US store operations, and is continuing efforts to improve sales at the May stores it acquired in 2005.
129;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-02-07T21:36:34Z;Wall St rebounds in volatile trading;;"US stocks rebounded on Thursday as bargain-hunters rushed to buy into market weakness and called a halt on a three-day losing run.Consumer stocks surged in volatile trading after reassuring earnings guidance from JC Penney and Gap helped offset earlier disappointment with Wal-Mart’s January sales figures.The sharp upswing bore some of the hallmarks of an over-sold bounce and was led by beaten-down financial, energy and telecoms stocks. The rally stemmed a slide of almost 5 per cent on the S&P 500 this week.In spite of a broad-based rally a weak sales outlook from Cisco continued to weigh on some large-cap technology companies. Utilities stocks also lagged.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,336.91, having fallen 0.7 per cent before rebounding as much as 1.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 12,247 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,293.30.“I think the most likely scenario is that we reached a low in January and we are now in the base-building process,” Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said.A broad range of retailers rallied after JC Penney, up 8.5 per cent at $47.44, said same-store sales declined less than forecast and fourth-quarter earnings would be at the high end of its forecast range. Gap’s shares also rebounded, up 7.2 per cent at $19.65 after its earnings outlook also pleased investors.Elsewhere retail sales figures were generally disappointing, as consumers faced with falling house prices reined in their discretionary spending. However, the S&P retail index climbed 3.7 per cent to 403.51 as analysts said weaker consumer spending was already priced in to many retail shares,Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose only 0.5 per cent in January, much less than the 2 per cent increase Wall Street had expected, and its February sales forecast also offered little cause for excitement. The shares fell in early trading but later closed up 2.1 per cent at $49.84.Upmarket retailer Nordstrom rose 3.7 per cent to $37.67 in spite of reporting a 6.6 per cent decline in same-store sales. Macy’s, up 4.9 per cent at $25.11 had reported a 7.1 per cent sales drop on Wednesday.Technology stocks also pared early losses caused by a cautious sales outlook from Cisco. The networking company said quarterly profit rose 7.2 per cent to $2.06bn, in line with analysts’ estimates, and projected 10 per cent sales growth for the fiscal third quarter, below expectations. The shares rose 1.3 per cent to $23.38.Many investors consider Cisco a bellwether for the sector and its cautious outlook kept shares in a some of large-cap tech companies under pressure. IBM fell 1.2 per cent to $102.34 and Hewlett Packard gave up 3.9 per cent to $40.50.There was mixed news on the employment front. Weekly jobless claims fell 22,000 to 356,000, but the reading was still far higher than many analysts had predicted. Jobless claims had surged the previous week to the highest reading in more than two years, but this time the market was expecting a figure of about 340,000. The four-week moving average of first time claims rose 8,500 to 335,000.“On balance, initial jobless claims have drifted higher, although at this point they remain below levels typically associated with outright recession,” economists at Bear Stearns said.Pending home sales fell a weaker-than-expected 1.5 per cent in December, according to the National Association of Realtors, and were down 24.2 per cent from the previous year. Homebuilder DR Horton rose 1.6 per cent to $15.04 after it posted a narrower-than-expected $128.8m quarterly loss.Consumer products group PepsiCo said fourth-quarter profit fell 30 per cent to $1.26bn from a year ago, when results were improved by a tax benefit. However, revenues rose 17 per cent to $12.35bn and the shares put on 5.5 per cent to $70.41.Rating agency Moody’s said fourth-quarter earnings fell 54 per cent to $127.3m as revenues from structured finance slumped. However, the result was slightly better than analysts had forecast and the stock surged 10.4 per cent to $37.Financial companies closed broadly higher after Jamie Dimon,chief executive of JP Morgan, said a possible downgrade of a key bond insurer would not be “that big a deal” for the banking industry. JP Morgan’s shares rose 3.2 per cent to $45.11Exchange operators also enjoyed a bounce after an analyst said the market overreacted to a Department of Justice call for ownership for clearing houses to be
broken off from futures exchanges. CME Group rose 8.8 per cent to $528.01 after falling 17.6 per cent the previous day."
130;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-02-07T19:45:21Z;US retail sales;;January proved frigid for US retailers. But although declining home values and the wobbly economy have prompted consumers to pare back spending, many retailers closed out the holiday season with fewer patches of frostbite than expected.Same-store sales by US retailers overall dropped 1.6 per cent last month, according to Sanford Bernstein. The broader market reacted uneasily to the results, particularly after Wal-Mart eked out a lower-than-expected same-store sales gain of just 0.5 per cent. Other retailers also undershot estimates, including department stores Macy’s, Dillard’s and Nordstrom and discounter Target.But contrary to expectations that the sky could fall, the sector’s sales decline was shallower than the 2.1 decrease analysts had forecast. Gap, J.C. Penney and several wholesale clubs beat expectations, and their share prices rallied. The Standard & Poor’s retail index, which has bounced sharply since January 15 on hopes that share prices had hit a trough, rose 5 per cent.Pinched by higher housing, gas and food costs and worried over the economy, some consumers are making more deliberate spending choices. This trend is not altogether surprising, given the country’s slightly negative savings rate. Shoppers are searching for clearance-sale bargains and using their holiday gift cards to buy staples. To counter their shrunken profit margins, Macy’s, Ann Taylor and a few other sector laggards have been forced to close stores and slash jobs.Yet after repeatedly ratcheting back earnings projections in recent quarters, other retailers who have managed their inventories well were able to stick to their earnings guidance this time around. Gap boosted full-year profit estimates after selling apparel at better-than-expected prices, and J.C. Penney said fourth-quarter earnings would hit the top end of its range. With market expectations already low, retailers who continue to underperform will struggle to lay the blame anywhere but on their own doorsteps.Post and read comments on this Lex
131;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-02-07T18:42:59Z;Post-holiday sales disappoint US retailers;;"Low-income customers at Wal-Mart appear to be using Christmas gift cards to buy food and other basics rather than using them on discretionary gifts, the largest US retailer said on Thursday, in a telling sign of the economic pressures facing the least well-off US consumers.Wal-Mart cited lower-than-expected redemptions of gift cards during January as a factor for moribund sales during the month. Sales at stores open at least a year increased by just 0.5 per cent, against its original forecast of 2 per cent growth.The retailer, which also blamed bad weather in the Midwest for the weak
figures, said: “Customers appear to be holding gift cards longer and using them more often for food and consumables rather than discretionary purchases.”Wal-Mart has sought to capitalise on its reputation for low pricing in the
current gloomy economic environment, announcing a range of price cuts in late January that it marketed as its own “economic stimulus plan for US shoppers”.But the poor January performance raises doubts over predictions from some Wall Street analysts that its model will perform better than its rivals as consumers become more cost conscious.Both Wal-Mart and Target, the rival discounter, reported that sales of food and healthcare items remained strong during the month. But Target reported a 1.1 per cent decline in comparable sales in January, with poor clothing sales again contributing to a slump that first hit the retailer in September.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said its comparable sales index rose just 0.2 per cent in January.There were a few exceptions to the generally bleak picture. JC Penney, the mid-range department store, said it did better than expected during the month, and issued a positive earnings forecast that drove its shares up 7 per cent, to $46.91 in early-afternoon trading.But its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 8.3 per cent as it cut prices to clear inventory, predicting earnings at the low end of its previous guidance.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chief executive, said that its “customers continue to be selective in their purchases, driven by value and need”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, said on Wednesday that its comparable sales fell 7.1 per cent in January, leading it to cut its earnings forecast for the quarter. It also announced it was shedding 2,300 administrative jobs. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 4 per cent increase in sales.But it said even its largely prosperous customers “have continued to shift more of their spending to promotional events”. Nordstrom, another high-end store, reported a 6.6 per cent fall in comparable sales, while Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer, said its same store sales were up 3.3 per cent."
132;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-01-31T22:22:48Z;US stocks rebound on bond insurer hopes;;US stocks rebounded strongly on Thursday after MBIA helped alleviate some of the concerns about troubled bond insurers at the end of the worst January for equities since 1990.Sentiment improved considerably after MBIA it had been the target of “fear-mongering” and was confident of retaining its triple-A rating.However, after the closing bell Standard & Poors served a reminder that bond insurers’ problems were not completely solved as it placed MBIA on watch for possible downgrade.Volatile equities had slumped at the open after a spike in jobless claims added to worries about the US labour market market as consumer spending slowed.Investors later rushed to buy into weakness after the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut raised the prospect of cheaper borrowing costs, a potential boon for financial companies and the prostrate real estate market. Energy companies rem­ained a weak spot, however, as corporate earnings disappointed.The S&P 500 closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,378.47 having initially fallen 1.6 per cent. The index fell 6.1 per cent in January, its worst start in 18 years.The S&P homebuilder index enjoyed a particularly strong bounce on Thursday, rising 11.6 per cent as investors cheered Pulte Homes‘ improved liquidity position. Its shares jumped more than 20 per cent to $16.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than more than 450 points from its session low to close up 1.7 per cent at 12,650.36. The Nasdaq Composite also gained 1.7 per cent to 2,389.86.“[The rebound] is primarily due to MBIA. There’s a lot of short covering, especially in the homebuilders,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.Stocks hit the skids in early trading after a sharp spike in weekly claims for un­employment benefit, which jumped 69,000 to 375,000, the highest level since October 2005, unsettled investor. Economists had expected about 320,000.Although these numbers are often volatile and may have been affected by the timing of a public holiday, the uptick will renew concerns that Friday’s employment report may not be as strong as hoped. Morgan Stanley cut its payrolls forecast to 90,000 from 110,000, still significantly more than than December’s 18,000.The bond insurance sector once again dominated market chatter as MBIA reported a $2.3bn fourth-quarter loss after writing down $3.5bn of credit derivatives. But the shares rallied 11 per cent to $15.50 after its chief executive said the company was best positioned to avoid a rating downgrade. Ambac Financial, a rival, climbed 6.8 per cent to $11.59.If bond insurance losses can be contained and earnings visibility increases, many analysts think the beaten-down S&P financial sector, up 2.7 per cent on Thursday, could become an attractive investment.Mastercard, rose 11.2 per cent to $210.09 on Thursday after fourth quarter earnings jumped nearly seven-fold. Meanwhile Bank of America rose 4.7 per cent to $44.18 after a hedge fund said it was seeking to block its takeover of Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender.Investors also bought battered consumer stocks, spurring a 4.4 per cent jump on the S&P retail index. A Deutsche Bank analyst upgraded the broadline retail sector to “neutral” from “cautious” and said said “the worst will soon be behind us”. Bear Stearns upgraded Nordstrom’s sharesprompting a gain of 5.4 per cent to $38.85.But mixed earnings and the slowdown in consumer spending underscored the riskiness of calling a bottom in the retail stocks. Personal spending rose 0.2 per cent in December, its slowest pace in six months/Procter & Gamble, up 0.7 per cent at $65.56, increased fiscal second-quarter earnings 14 per cent and the company raised its full-year outlook.Burger King, up 2.9 per cent at $46.51, also beat estimates as second-quarter profit jumped 29 per cent. Mattel rose 10.9 per cent to $21.01 after beating quarterly profit forecasts.In contrast, Starbucks’ cautious outlook for 2008 unnerved investors. The shares fell 1.6 per cent to $18.91.After the close Google‘s fourth quarter profit missed expectations causing the shares, which closed up 2.9 per cent at $564.30, to slump 8.1 per cent.Adobe Systems fell 2.8 per cent to $34.93 yesterday after Jefferies & Co. downgraded it from “buy” to “underperform”.In energy, Cameron International dropped 6.9 per cent to $40.10 after the oil services company gavea weaker-than-expected earnings guidance. Marathon Oil’s fourth-quarter earnings fell 38 per cent as refining margins weakened and its shares shed 7.3 per cent to $47.21.
133;JWN;Nordstrom;2008-01-15T21:34:10Z;Wall Street hit by weak retail sales data;;US stocks plunged to their lowest level in ten months after Citigroup revealed a record $9.8bn quarterly loss and an unexpected decline in retail sales eroded confidence in the consumer sector.Concerns about problems in Citi’s consumer business and fears of further big writedowns in the financial sector sent equities into a spin. Energy stocks also hit the skids as the crude oil price retreated amid fears of weakening US demand.Even the prospect of sweeping interest rate cuts did little to stem losses as traders bet the US economy was heading for a sharp downturn.The S&P 500 fell 2.5 per cent to 1,380.95, its lowest level since March. The sell-off was broad-based, with only 24 companies trading in positive territory. The S&P moved further below its 80-week moving average, a technical support level last breached five years ago.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.2 per cent to 12,501.11 with Boeing among the leading bluechip fallers amid unconfirmed reports the company may announce more delays to its 787 Dreamliner jet. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.5 per cent to 2,417.59.Stocks hit reverse gear after Citigroup wrote off $18.1bn in subprime-related losses causing the bank to sink to a massive fourth-quarter loss and slash its dividend by 40 per cent.Traders were expecting Citi to “kitchen sink” the fourth quarter, but the $9.8bn loss still came as a shock to some analysts, who had forecast about half that amount.Citi’s consumer credit costs increased $5.4bn and included a $3.85bn charge to shore up loan loss reserves, suggesting the bank is heavily exposed to the weak US consumer loan market. The stock plunged 7.3 per cent to $26.94.Citi and Merrill Lynch said they would raise a total of $21.1bn in fresh capital to help shore up their weakened balance sheets. Merrill, which reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday, fell 5.3 per cent to $53.01.Elsewhere, Moneygram sank 49.5 per cent to $6.15 after the payment services company said net unrealised losses on the value of asset-backed securities rose from $571m to $860m.State Street, the money manager, fell 5.9 per cent to $79.82 after its fourth-quarter earnings fell 28 per cent and it set aside $618m to settle subprime-related legal claims.Consumer companies were also pummelled on Tuesday after retail sales capped their worst year since 2002 with a 0.4 per cent decline in December, the first monthly fall since June.Recent same-store sales results at mid and upmarket retailers have been poor but economists had still forecast an unchanged reading.The sales decline added to fears that US consumers, faced with falling house prices and rising mortgage costs, were trimming their spending on non-essentials.“A lot of the data are pointing to either very slow growth or a recession at this point,” said Brian Gendreau, investment strategist at ING Investment Management.Williams-Sonoma fell 9.9 per cent to $20.01 after the home furnishing retailer reported a decline in same-store sales and cut its full-year outlook.Sears Holdings and Nordstrom, the department store chains, fell 5.9 per cent to $86.02 and 5 per cent to $30.17 respectively.In technology Apple’s shares plunged 5.5 per cent to $169.04 after investors reacted with disappointment to a range of new product launches. Intel closed only 1.7 per cent lower at $22.69 but the shares plunged 10 per cent after-hours. The chipmaker reported a 51 per cent increase in net income to $2.27bn, narrowly missing Wall Street’s estimates.A combination of worrying employment data, a manufacturing slowdown and retail weakness have convinced traders that nothing less than a 50 basis point interest rate cut at the end of this month will do.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, last week assured the market that the Fed was prepared to take “substantive” action on rates.However many traders still believe the prospect of substantial easing is too little, too late: “The Fed is way behind the curve,” Todd Salamone, vice president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said.Equity markets usually welcome interest rate cuts, but some analysts fear an emergency 75bp cut would indicate the Fed believes the US economy is severely threatened. “I don’t think they will go with an inter-meeting move, as that would signal panic,” Mr Gendreau said.An unexpected decline in producer prices last month may give the Fed more room more manoeuvre. Producer prices fell 0.1 per cent in December. However, for the year, headline producer prices rose 6.3 per cent, the largest increase since 1981.
134;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-12-24T19:07:22Z;Financials bring cheer on Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks rose on Monday after a spate of deal-making and a capital injection at Merrill Lynch helped spur a pre-Christmas rally on Wall Street.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,496.45 the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 13,549.33 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.8 per cent to 2,713.50.With many traders taking the day off, volumes were light before the session concluded at 1pm.Financial stocks posted solid gains after Merrill Lynch said it would raise up to $6.2bn from Temasek Holdings and Davis Selected Advisors, through the private placement of new common stock.Merrill also said it would sell most of its middle-market commercial finance unit to General Electric’s finance arm, allowing the company to free-up around $1.3bn in capital.Temasek, a Singaporean state investment arm, will invest $4.4bn and has the option to put in additional $600m . Davis, a US-based asset manager, will put up $1.2bn as part of a “long term investment”.Merrill’s shares rose as much as 5 per cent but later erased these gains and fell 3 per cent to $53.90 after it said Temasek would acquire its stake for only $48-a-share.Like many US banks Merrill needs to shore up its balance sheet after it took $8.4bn in writedowns in October, with further damage expected when it reports fourth quarter results in January.Goldman Sachs rose 2.3 per cent to $214.32 on news it has moved closer to acquiring the assets of Cheyne Finance, a troubled $7bn structured investment vehicle now known as SIV Portfolio, which went into receivership in September.US banks have struggled to bring liquidity to the market in securities controlled by off-balance sheet investment vehicles.A US-Treasury backed plan to create a $75bn “superfund” to buy SIV assets collapsed on Friday. However, analysts said they did not expect the unwinding of the fund to have big implications for financial markets.In other deal news Alcoa rose 1.8 per cent to $37.01 after the mining company agreed to sell its packaging and consumer businesses to Rank Group for $2.7bn in cash.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries gained 2.9 per cent to $46.48 after it raised its full-year earnings guidance. Wyeth, a rival, fell 3 per cent to $45.45 after it said it would sue to recover lost income from sales of Teva’s generic version of its Protonix heartburn drug.United Rentals, up 4.4 per cent at $18.70, said it would seek a $100m non-complete fee from Cerberus Capital Management after the private equity group pulled its $4bn takeover offer last month.Retailers posted strong gains on the last shopping day before Christmas but as many analysts remained downbeat on prospects for the holiday season.Office Depot rose 6.7 per cent to $13.96 while JC Penney and Nordstrom, the department store operators, gained 4.6 per cent to $45.85 and 3.8 per cent to $37.65 respectively.Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by activist investor William Ackman, said on Monday it had increased its stake in Target, the discount retailer, to just under 10 per cent. The shares gained 3.5 per cent to $52.47.Stocks ended last week on a high after technology and energy stocks spurred a pre-Christmas rally on Wall Street.Many investors are hoping that a phenomenon known as the “Santa Claus rally” makes an appearance again this year: the tendency of stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and New Year.European stocks also enjoyed a holiday-season boost. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index added 1 per cent while the FTSE 100 gained 0.7 per cent. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 1.8 per cent jump on the Hang Seng.The rally in equity markets drove mild selling pressure in US Treasury markets. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 5 basis points to 3.24 per cent and the 10-year Treasury note yield gained 4bp to 4.21 per cent.The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen and the pound but fell against the the euro. Crude oil prices climbed 63 cents to $93.94 while gold prices edged up $0.80 to $816.2.
135;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-11-23T18:47:05Z;Ailing mortage lenders set tone on Wall St;;The bears remained in charge on Wall Street this week when fears about a US economic slowdown and the continuing fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis bled confidence from jittery equity markets.With shoppers hitting the stores after Thanksgiving on Friday, beginning the most important shopping period of the year, US retailers were the focus of worries about a lacklustre holiday season.The Federal Reserve added to the prevailing malaise this week after it gave a downbeat assessment of prospects for US economic growth. “We’ve certainly upped the odds of a recession,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said.The S&P 500 rose 1,7 per cent to 1440.70 on Friday, closing the week on a high note as traders went bargain hunting after recent sharp falls.However the index was down 1.2 per cent for the week, a trading period truncated by the Thanksgiving holiday and a half-day session on Friday.The S&P 500 has remained below its 200-day moving average for 10 consecutive sessions, a bearish indicator, longer than during the initial summer credit squeeze.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.5 per cent on the week at 12,980.88, briefly falling below its mid-August trough before traders bought into weakness.The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent on the week at 2,596.60. The index has fallen 9.2 per cent from its 52-week high, set on October 31, as technology stocks have struggled to find a footing.Transport stocks, a traditional bellwether of economic sentiment, fared particularly poorly, with crude oil prices rising above $99 a barrel this week.The Dow transport index, down 2.5 per cent at 4,451.07, neared a key bearish indicator, a 20 per cent fall from its high for the year.Among the worst performing stocks this week were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises that provide liquidity to US mortgage markets by buying, securitising and guaranteeing home loans.The declining value of its mortgage-related securities contributed to a $2bn loss at Freddie Mac this week, with the shares falling 35 per cent to $26.47. Freddie warned it will need to raise capital, possibly by slashing its dividend in half, in order to meet regulatory requirements.Fannie Mae, a rival mortgage agency, was down 20.9 per cent to $32.20, amid continuing worries about the way it accounts for loan losses.Concerns that these agencies will be constrained in their ability to provide liquidity to the broader mortgage market hit a range of financial stocks this week.Countrywide Financial sank 20.1 per cent on the week to $9.65 after analysts said the company could be affected if GSEs stopped buying its mortgages in the secondary market.However, the company said rumours that it would seek bankruptcy protection were “absolutely false”.Meanwhile the big banks once again suffered a torrid week, precipitated by a Goldman Sachs analyst note that forecast another $48bn in writedowns by the end of 2008. Citigroup shed 6.8 per cent to $31.70 after the note said Citi could take $22bn in writedowns linked to its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations, $11bn this quarter, and $11bn next year.Homebuilder stocks were also punished amid a deepening malaise in the US real estate market.The S&P homebuilder index was down 14.3 per cent this week at 318.07, declining for six consecutive days before buyers sparked a rebound on Friday.Shares in Pulte Homes shed 25 per cent of their value this week at $9.63.With house prices plummeting, nervous investors are keeping a careful eye on retail sales amid fears that belt-tightening consumers may deliver a poor shopping holiday season.Office Depot fell 8.6 per cent to $17.50 this week after quarterly earnings fell 9 per cent while Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, was down 11 per cent at $22.27 during the period after it cut its full-year outlook. Gap declined 6 per cent to $18.89 after same-store sales fell 5 per cent.However, the retail picture was not universally bleak. Nordstrom rose 9.9 per cent to $35.72 on the week, after the department store’s quarterly earnings beat expectations. Electronics retailer Circuit City soared 19.5 per cent to $6.51 on Friday, 5.9 per cent higher for the week.Elsewhere, General Motors was the Dow’s biggest faller this week, down 7.2 per cent at $27.16.
136;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-11-23T02:03:49Z;Stores warned of gift card backlash;;US retailers are this season facing the first signs of a backlash from consumer advocates over one of their most profitable lines – sales of gift cards, which the National Retail Federation expects to be worth about $26.5bn (£12.8bn, €17.8bn) over the holiday period.More than half of all US shoppers are likely to buy a gift card, according to the NRF, and more than 80 per cent of them will buy more than two.The forecast 5.7 per cent increase in sales compares with the 4 per cent growth expected for overall retail sales.But earlier this month, Consumer Reports, published by the non-profit Consumers’ Union, ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times highlighting the fact that customers threw away an estimated $8bn last year as a result of unused, lost, damaged or expired cards.“Easy money for retailers. Lost money for you,” the advertisement read.A national survey by the group in October of 1,003 adults found that 27 per cent of those who received gift cards in the previous holiday had still not used one or more of them.Gift cards, which are pre-paid and store-specific, started catching on in the US at the start of the decade. This year more retailers have started reporting both the extent of their gift card liabilities, and the revenue accruing from unused or so-called broken cards.Gap, the clothing retailer, said its gift card liabilities stood at $337m in February this year. It also recognised $31m of income last year when it shortened the period after which it considered a card “broken” from five to three years.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, recorded a $19m gain from broken cards last year, bringing to $78m the total gain since it started recognising the revenues three years ago.It considers a card broken after two years, and had gift card liabilities of $494m in March.Nordstrom, the upmarket speciality fashion store, estimates that 3.5 per cent of all the cards it sells are never used, and has recognised $13.3m since it launched its programme in 1999. Starbucks, the coffee company, recognised $4.4m in unused card income in 2006.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, does not give numbers for its gift card liabilities, but Target, its smaller rival, had $338m in gift cards outstanding in February this year.Amazon, the online retailer, had $183m, up 40 per cent on the previous year, representing 1.7 per cent of its total sales.Retailers, attracted both by the sales and the interest-free loan provided by gift card purchases, continue to expand their offerings, with company’s such as Safeway’s Blackhawk subsidiary now stocking “gift card malls” in supermarkets and drug stores.Innovations include DVD-readable cards used by Best Buy and Circuit City, while Starbucks and others encourage customers to go to their website to customise their card designs.In another sign that consumers may be increasingly aware of the costs of cards, a new website, Leveragecard.com, will next week offer interest on gift cards held online on a site that will allow users both to manage gift cards and retailer loyalty programmes.“We can actually offer 3.65 per cent to people that purchase cards through the site,” says Mark Roberts.
137;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
138;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-11-20T21:41:10Z;US indices hit reverse on Freddie Mac gloom;;Wall Street endured another volatile session on Tuesday after a large loss at Freddie Mac, the mortgage agency, reinforced worries about credit-losses in the financial sector.Energy and mining stocks were buoyed by a spike in commodity prices, with crude oil futures closing at a record high above $98 a barrel.Some strong results from Hewlett-Packard cheered harried investors early in the session but confidence waned after poor housing data hit homebuilder stocks.Minutes from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s October meeting, released in mid-afternoon, provided little encouragement to traders betting on future rate cuts, referring to last month’s decision to ease as a “close call”.However, the futures market continued to price in a rate cut next month after a new quarterly Fed report on the outlook for the US economy cautioned that GDP growth would slow next year while unemployment could rise slightly, while inflation was expected to remain moderate.The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a 268-point intraday swing but closed only 0.4 per cent higher at 13010.14. The S&P 500 opened strongly, then fell as much as 1 per cent, before closing up 0.5 per cent at 1439.70 .The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent at 2596.81.Traders have become accustomed to these large intra-day share price movements.“If anyone out there with sizeable capital goes in at the end of the day, and goes either long or short, all the speculators out there tend to jump on board. That exacerbates the move,” Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at Charles Schwab said. “They are desperately scared of being caught on the wrong side of it,”The CBOE Vix index fell 4.2 per cent at 24.9 on Tuesday but remains elevated, amid continued expectations of share price volatility.Some terrible results from Freddie Mac, the government sponsored mortgage company, provided a further blow to confidence in the financial sector on Tuesday.Freddie’s third-quarter net loss widened sharply to $2.03bn as it set aside $1.2bn to account for bad home loans. The shares plummeted 28.7 per cent to $26.74 after it said it was “seriously considering” cutting its dividend by half to raise capital. Shares in fellow mortgage lender Fannie Mae fell 24.8 per cent at $28.25, leaving them almost 60 per cent below their high this year.Countrywide Financial, suffered sharp falls after an analyst said funding shortages at Fannie and Freddie could hurt the largest US mortgage lender. But the shares rallied to close only 2.7 per cent lower at $10.28 after the mortgage lender said persistent rumours that it could go bankrupt were “absolutely false.”Citigroup fell 1.9 per cent at $31.40 after Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo cut his price target to $29. He said “recent problems with CDOs and their lack of disclosure reflect a serious risk management break-down” and could prompt regulators to impose restrictions “such as the inability to pursue acquisitions”.Elsewhere trading was extremely choppy.Hewlett-Packard reported a 28 per cent leap in fourth-quarter net income, while sales rose 15 per cent and were nearly $1bn higher than Wall Street had anticipated. The stock closed up 0.2 per cent at $49.56. Google clung on to a 3.6 per cent gain at $648.54 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $900.Retailers were also in focus amid contrasting quarterly corporate performance.Target’s third-quarter earnings slid 4 per cent, missing expectations. The shares fell 4.1 per cent to $51.69 even as the discount retailer announced a new $10bn share buy-back programme. Office Depot, lost 7 per cent at $17.48 after quarterly profit fell 9 per cent. But Nordstrom surged 12.1 per cent to $34.21 after its quarterly earnings increased more than anticipated.There was more bad news for the real estate sector. Although housing starts rose a surprising 3 per cent in October, building permits were 6.6 per cent lower, more than expected.“Despite the increase in starts in October, there is no evidence here of housing market stabilisation,” economists at Bear Stearns said.Shares in the big homebuilders felt heavy selling pressure, although DR Horton, which swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter loss, closed 2.5 per cent higher at $11.53. The S&P homebuilder index shed 5.2 per cent at 326.12.
139;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Target upbeat on holiday despite profits fall;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Tuesday disclosed an unexpected 4 per cent fall in quarterly earnings but remained upbeat about the prospects for the important holiday quarter.Bob Ulrich, chief executive, insisted Target had “not observed any meaningful change in the intensity of the competitive environment”, though he conceded the third quarter had been “disappointing”. Target’s sanguine view of the forthcoming holiday contrasts with the bleak picture painted last week by JC Penney, whose customer-base overlaps with Target.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, and Wal-Mart have also remained broadly optimistic about the holiday.High-end stores have shaken off a significant impact from the broader economy, with Saks on Tuesday reporting that its third-quarter earnings had tripled to $21.6m, or 14 cents a share, supported in part by tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar at its flagship New York store.On Monday evening, Nordstrom said it expected its fourth-quarter earnings to be ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, and pointed to continued strong demand for its designer fashions.Target said its gross margins in the third quarter had been hit by slower sales of clothing as a result of the exceptionally warm autumn weather, while home furnishing sales had remained soft owing to the impact of the downturn in the housing market.Gregg Steinhafel, president, said November sales had been supported by a recovery in clothing and strong growth in electronics.“We’re cautiously optimistic that overall we’re going to have a decent holiday season,” he said.Target also announced a $10bn share repurchase programme, to run over three years, which includes $3.4bn outstanding from a buy-back announced in 2004. It said it expected half or more of the buy-back to be completed by the end of 2008.Target said it expected to make a decision on whether or not to sell its $7bn credit-card portfolio by the end of December. A review was launched after Bill Ackman, the activist investor, acquired control of more than 5 per cent of its shares.
140;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-11-13T22:06:53Z;Wall St rallies as confidence returns;;US stocks enjoyed their best day in almost two months after Wal-Mart’s latest quarterly earnings helped restore a measure of confidence in the health of the US consumer.Financial stocks surged even as Bank of America became the latest group to disclose big writedowns.Investors were cheered after the chief executive of Goldman Sachs said the bank did not expect to make any significant writedowns.Meanwhile, technology stocks rebounded, with Apple leading the charge, bringing an end to a four-day losing streak for the sector.Stocks extended gains after the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose last month, the first increase since June.The S&P 500 index closed 2.9 per cent higher at 1,481.01 its biggest advance since mid-September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose back above 13,000, gaining 2.5 per cent to 13,307.09 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.5 per cent to 2,673.65.Wal-Mart saw a higher-than-expected 8 per cent rise in third-quarter profits and raised its full-year earnings forecast. Its shares climbed 6.1 per cent to $45.97, their biggest one-day gain in five years.Adrianne Shapira, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the retailer was “an excellent place to hide in the current choppy macro environment”.Home Depot underscored lingering concerns about the US retail sector after its quarterly profit fell 26.8 per cent. The home improvement chain has been hurt by the deteriorating US housing market. The results matched Wall Street’s forecasts and the shares gained 2.3 per cent at $29.12.The S&P retail index rose 3.8 per cent at 435.64. Macy’s gained 6.6 per cent at $30.65, Nordstrom rose 4.5 per cent at $34.50 and Office Depot jumped 5.4 per cent at $19.84.The better tone in stocks triggered a 23 per cent slide in equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index. The Vix closed above 31 on Monday, its highest level since March 2003, but fell to 24 on Tuesday.“Markets are likely to remain volatile during the coming week as risk aversion predominates,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “But the equity correction has already run a long way, and there could be signs of relief to come.”Financials enjoyed bumper gains after Goldman Sachs‘ chief executive said he does not expect the bank to take any significant asset write-downs. Speaking about the firm’s difficult-to-value level three assets Lloyd Blankfein said: “We’re confident we have a grip on the valuation of these things.” The shares soared 8.5 per cent to $233.04, their biggest one-day advance in six years.But Joe Price, Bank of America‘s chief financial officer, addressing the same conference, said his company expected to record $3bn in writedowns related to its exposure to collateralised debt obligations. But its shares still rose 5.2 per cent at $46.27 after the bank said it was sitting on a potential gain of more than $30bn on its investment in China Construction Bank.E-Trade Financial jumped 40.8 per cent at $5 after BMO Capital Markets said the online brokerage was “highly unlikely” to go bankrupt. The shares plunged 59 per cent the previous day after an analyst raised the possibility of a run on E-Trade’s bank.Other banks and brokerages surged. Lehman Brothers rose 9.2 per cent at $63.49 after an analyst at UBS said potential losses from CDOs were “negligible”. Citigroup rose 6.9 per cent at $35.90 while JPMorgan added 6.3 per cent to $45.05.The S&P investment bank index rose 6.8 per cent at 190.68 while the financial index rose 4.9 per cent at 426.93. Also on the rebound were technology stocks, a sector that has borne the brunt of recent selling pressure on concerns about a slowdown in corporate tech spending.Apple rallied 10.5 per cent at $169.96 on reports it was in talks about launching its iPhone in China. Oracle gained 5.6 per cent at $20.52 while Research In Motion rose 9.7 per cent at $112.55.But Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research said there remained an “underlying inconsistency between being pessimistic on US consumer trends and optimistic on technology spending activity”.
141;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-11-09T23:26:14Z;Confidence in US tech sector melts away;;US stocks fell sharply this week as credit market losses at financial companies and fears of a decline in corporate spending on technology unsettled US equity markets.Confidence in the tech sector’s ability to rise above mortgage-related problems evaporated amid worries about falling technology budgets at big banks. An index of large-cap technology stocks posted its worst weekly performance in more than five years.Credit market jitters flared after big writedowns and rising loan-loss provisions at financial companies. The automotive sector suffered after General Motors posted the second largest quarterly loss in US corporate history.The S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent Friday at 1,453.70, its lowest in two months and 3 per cent lower for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.4 per cent on the week at 13,042.74 points.Both indices fell below their 200-day moving averages this week, commonly viewed as a bearish indicator, and have erased all their gains since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in mid-September.“For all the rampant bullish talk from ‘containment’ to ‘resilience’ to ‘decoupling’, 75 basis points of Fed easing have done absolutely nothing for the stock market,” said David Rosenberg, chief US economist at Merrill Lynch.Consumer staples and utilities fared best as investors sought safety in recession-resistant stocks. The CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer – spiked 23.7 per cent to 28.48 on the week, a level last reached at the height of the summer credit squeeze.The most significant losses were in the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite was 5.8 per cent lower on the week at 2,627.94. Large-cap tech stocks, previously considered safe havens by investors, fell even more. The Nasdaq 100 shed 6.8 per cent to 2,034.30, its worst weekly sell-off since April 2002.“The breadth of this year’s rally in tech has been narrow, only 25 per cent of tech companies have outperformed the index,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment strategist at Harris Private Bank. “If the economy really slows down and inflation picks up, this is a group of sitting ducks.”The slide in tech stocks was sparked by Cisco Systems, whose chief executive said “dramatic year-on-year decreases in orders” from big banks could slow growth. Its stock fell 12.1 per cent at $28.58 on the week.Investors view Cisco as a bellwether for the technology sector and the comments sparked a big sell-off.Cognizant Technology Solutions shed 24.7 per cent at $32.75 after its fourth-quarter revenue guidance missed expectations. Oracle fell 12.1 per cent at $19.36, Apple was down 12 per cent at $165.37 and Google fell below $700, down 6.6 per cent at $663.97.Financials had another highly volatile week. Morgan Stanley, down 8 per cent at $54.20, declared a $3.7bn loss on subprime mortgage-linked securities.Wachovia lost 5.1 per cent on the week at $40.65. It said its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations – securities linked to the troubled mortgage market – had lost $1.1bn in value during October. American International Group’s quarterly earnings declined 27 per cent and the shares fell 3.6 per cent on the week at $57.02.Washington Mutual fell 13.9 per cent at $20.51 after it increased its credit loss provision to $1.3bn this quarter and forecast mortgage lending would plunge next year. Citigroup declined 11.7 per cent to $33.10 on the week. Its shares had fallen for eight days before a modest rally Friday.Capital One Financial, the biggest US credit card issuer, fell 11.3 per cent to $54.26 after it said writedowns on bad credit card debt could reach the “mid-$5bn” range. American Express fell 3.3 per cent at $56.49.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – the government-chartered companies that own or guarantee about 40 per cent of US mortgages – declined 6.9 per cent to $49 and 13.7 per cent to $41.70, respectively. Both companies were subpoenaed by the New York attorney-general, who has widened his inquiry into the US mortgage industry.General Motors and Ford Motor shed 15.5 per cent at $31.28 and 8.4 per cent at $8.20 respectively on the week. GM reported a $39bn loss after taking a non-cash charge against future tax benefits.Retailers dipped after disappointing October sales data. Wal-Mart declined 2.9 per cent on the week at $42.90. The S&P retail index fell 6.3 per cent at 415.50. The luxury sector was hit hard. Nordstrom, the upmarket store, fell 11.3 per cent to $32.38 and jeweller Tiffany & Co fell 11.6 per cent at $43.92.
142;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-11-08T16:03:40Z;Weather and economy hit US stores;;One of the largest US retailers sounded a warning on Thursday over the prospects for holiday sales, after economic worries and warmer than ususal weather led to disappointing October sales.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, said his mid-range department store chain expected “the challenging retail environment to continue for the foreseeable future”, after announcing that sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.8 per cent in October.”Our customers are clearly facing headwinds that are impacting both sentiment and discretionary spending levels, including weak housing market conditions, high energy prices, and uncertainty in the mortgage and credit markets,” he said.Bob Ulrich, chief executive of Target Stores, noted that for the second month in a row the discount retailer experienced soft sales in higher margin categories, including clothing and warm weather items, as the company reported comparable sales growth of 4.1 per cent.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, reported a 1.5 per cent fall in same store sales, while Kohl’s said same store sales fell by 3.8 per cent. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store that traditionally outperforms the sector, reported a 2.4 per cent drop in comparable sales.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chief executive, said sales of outerwear, fleece and sweaters “experienced significant declines …contributing to our sales shortfall” as a result of the warm weather.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, also reported soft apparel sales as it announced that its comparable sales increased by 0.4 per cent during the month. Wal-Mart, which launched aggressive pre-holiday price cuts in October, said it expected comparable sales to increase by between 0 and 2 per cent in November.Speciality clothing sellers were also hard hit. Limited Brands saw its comparable sales fall 6 per cent, while Gap posted an 8 per cent drop. Chico’s FAS reported a 10.6 per cent sales drop and added profit would fall sharply in the current quarter.Retail Metrics, a firm that tracks the monthly same store data, said that its index of sales increased 1.9 per cent for the month, following a disappointing 1.6 per cent increase in September.“There is virtually no momentum coming out of September and October as we head into the thick of the holiday shopping season,” the firm said in its analysis of the data.
143;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-10-11T20:29:13Z;Wall St falls as confidence evaporates;;US stocks erased gains in a volatile afternoon session as confidence suddenly evaporated from the market.Technology shares led the falls after an analyst at JP Morgan lowered his sales estimate for Baidu.com.Large-cap technology stocks, which have lately enjoyed strong gains, were sold down rapidly as momentum evaporated and investors took profits.Traders were also concerned by comments by Axel Weber, a governing council member of the European Central Bank, said the bank may need to raise interest rates to control inflation.Having climbed as high as 2,834, the Nasdaq Composite fell as much as 2.7 per cent from its high to close 1.4 per cent lower on the day at 2,772.20.The S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent lower at 1,554.42 after it hit a new intra-day high of 1,576.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit a new high but closed 0.5 per cent lower at 14,015.12“The technology sector was extremely overbought going into today,” Paul Hickey co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group said.Amazon, down 5.6 per cent at $89.34 and Yahoo 2.5 per cent lower at $27.65 were sold down. Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry, saw some of the heaviest falls, down 5 per cent at $111.Baidu.com, which appeared to spark the sell-off, shed 10 per cent to $308.75 after JPMorgan cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by 3.2 per cent.Having surged to a record high of $641.41 Google closed the day down 0.5 per cent at $621.73.Earlier, positive news from Wal-Mart had helped soothe concerns about the outlook for US corporate earnings and offset weaker sales figures from other retailers.Wal-Mart surprised analysts by raising its third-quarter earnings estimate, helped by improved margins and expenses.The group expects third-quarter earnings of between 66 and 69 cents a share compared with previous guidance of 62-65 cents.But Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose 1.4 per cent in September, slightly less than expected. The shares gained 2.9 per cent to $46.90.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the results showed consumers were still going to the shops.“The reality is that consumer spending is a reflection of jobs and wages, not home values,” he said.There was disappointing news from other retailers as September sales fell below expectations after unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers away.Target, the discount retailer, fell 1.8 per cent to $64.62 after it said fiscal 2007 earnings would come in below its previous guidance of $3.60 a share.Nordstrom was 7.5 per cent lower at $44.97 after it warned lower-than-expected sales would cause third-quarter profit to fall below previous estimates.Gap was 1.4 per cent lower at $19.06 after announcing a same-store sales decline of 7 per cent in September. Analysts had expected a fall of 4.4 per cent.JC Penney fell 7 per cent to $63.27 after same-store sales dropped 4.6 per cent. Same-store sales at Abercrombie & Fitch fell 4 per cent in September. The shares fell 1.3 per cent at $83.45.After disappointing results and forecasts from blue chips on Wednesday, fears rose that third-quarter earnings could decline.“Overall the market is probably headed lower. Earnings growth will slow to around 3 per cent, down from the previous quarter and at levels we haven’t seen for several years,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Avalon Partners. “I believe the market is overbought and third-quarter earnings will weigh.”Carmakers were cheered after the United Auto Workers union ended a strike against Chrysler just a few hours after it had begun.General Motors was among the leading stocks on the Dow, up 4.9 per cent to $39.99, its highest level since the end of 2004. Ford rose 6.5 per cent to $8.76.The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit narrowed more than expected in August, declining 2.4 per cent to $57.6bn.Initial claims for unemployment benefit fell 12,000 last week to 308,000, slightly better than expected.Interest rate futures priced in only a 36 per cent likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by the end of this month but the market still expects another easing by the end of the year.
144;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-10-11T19:29:09Z;Warm weather softens US retail forecasts;;A dozen leading US retailers lowered their earnings forecasts on Thursday after unseasonably warm weather combined with the continuing housing market slump to slow September store sales.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its sales index for September rose just 1.6 per cent, against analysts’ forecasts of 2.3 per cent, and that all segments of the industry had been hit.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said “weather definitely distorted the month and made it look worse than it was”.But he said consumers were “finding it more difficult to get access to credit” as adjustable rate mortgages continue to reset. The housing market was still declining, “making consumers feel less wealthy” while food and energy prices were rising.Frank Badillo, economist at TNS Retail Forward, said that while the warm weather had affected sales of autumn clothing, shoppers were “also clearly telling us they want to hold the line on spending”.The retailers that lowered earnings guidance ranged from Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion store, to Target, the discount chain, underlining the broad impact of this autumn’s retail slowdown.PetSmart, the pet supplies retailer, lowered guidance on Tuesday, citing both weather and macro-economic conditions, while Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, trimmed its guidance last month.JCPenney, the department store, saw its shares fall more than 4 per cent after it sharply reduced its third-quarter earnings forecast. The retailer cited the impact of the housing slump on its home furnishings sales.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, also reported continued softness in its home and apparel sales.It said that a 1.4 per cent rise in same-store sales during the month had been driven by grocery and pharmacy sales – areas where its low prices are attractive to lower income shoppers. Wal-Mart said its research “reinforces that customers remain concerned about their finances, especially the cost of living”.However, the retailer also surprised Wall Street by increasing its earning guidance for the third quarter, citing a reduction in price mark-downs, and cost-cutting efforts in its US stores.Wal-Mart’s shares rose more than 3 per cent on the news.In an indication of continuing consumer uncertainties, TNS Retail Forward said on Thursday its monthly ShopperScape survey of 4,000 households had found that 27 per cent planned to spend “somewhat less” or “much less” during the holiday season, a rise from 21 per cent last year.The number saying they plan to spend “about the same” came in at just less than two-thirds, compared with almost three quarters of shoppers last year.
145;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-09-06T18:20:49Z;US retailers see solid August;;Leading US retailers on Thursday reported better than expected August sales as shoppers shrugged off the credit anxieties afflicting Wall Street.Wal-Mart, Macy’s and Target delivered stronger-than-expected growth in sales at stores open at least a year, while Retail Metrics’ monthly comparable sales index showed average growth of 3.1 per cent, beating its 2.6 per cent forecast.But analysts warned that the month did not represent a deeper shift in consumer sentiment.Frank Badillo, senior economist at TNS Retail Forward, said that while “shoppers were not spooked” by fears of a credit crunch, “that only means that the fallout for households will hit home more gradually in the coming months”.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that, in spite of the August figures, overall sales continued to grow at a slower rate than last year as consumers faced concerns over housing prices and fuel costs. Retail Metrics said its index showed average monthly growth of 2.8 per cent so far this year, down from 3.7 per cent for the first eight months of 2006.Mr Badillo said retailers “are on a slowing trend that we have seen since January or so”. He said he expected further slowing as consumers face higher mortgage costs and reduced access to low-cost financing from car makers and others, as well as increased job insecurity.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported a 3.1 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, ahead of Wall Street’s 1.6 per cent forecast, as it cut prices on back-to-school items.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s Supercenters and discount outlets still grew by less than in the same period last year, up 2.8 per cent against 2.9 per cent last year. But overall sales were supported by a 5.2 per cent increase in comparable sales at the retailer’s Sam’s Club discount warehouses.Target, Wal-Mart’s smaller rival discounter, reported a 6.1 per cent increase in monthly sales, which Bob Ulrich, chief executive, said was “near the upper end of our planned range”.Sales at Macy’s, the largest US department store, beat its predictions of a 1 to 3 per cent fall during the month, with a 2.4 per cent increase.The luxury sector continued its strong run as Saks reported a same-store sales jump of 18.2 per cent on demand for designer clothing and shoes, and Nordstrom recorded a 6.6 per cent gain.
146;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-08-21T19:17:20Z;Target shrugs off economic woes;;Target on Tuesday underlined the resilience of middle-income US consumers by reporting strong quarterly earnings in spite of worries over the housing market and energy costs.While the US discount store chain said it would be slightly more conservative in its planning for the remainder of the year, Bob Ulrich, chief executive, said the company continued to believe it “will deliver strong sales and profit performance in 2007”.He said that Target’s forecast earnings of $3.60 a share for the year remained “within the range of likely outcomes”.The results from the retailer, known for its “cheap chic” offerings, contrasted with last week’s lowered earnings guidance from Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer.Wal-Mart cited economic pressures on its lower income customers, saying it was seeing evidence that its customers were running out of money at the end of each month.However, Target’s stronger performance was mirrored in robust results last week from JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores that serve similar customers, and from Nordstrom’s, the upmarket fashion store.US retail stores have seen monthly comparable sales growing at a slower rate this year compared with 2006, which analysts attribute to the impact of higher energy costs and interest rates.Mr Ulrich noted that Target’s sales at stores open at least a year had increased by almost 1 per cent less than last year during the first six months of the year.“We’re not anticipating that will soften. We’re saying we’re at slightly more modest pace than we were last year, and we see that continuing into the fall season,” he said.Bob Buchanan, retail analyst at AG Edwards, said on Tuesday that “overall …the consumer seems tired, and dragged down by such issues as the weak housing market and the related negative impact on personal balance sheets”.He forecast that the six-month average of AG Edwards same-store retail sales index would slip further during the second half of the year, from an expected 2 per cent for the six months up to August.For the quarter, Target reported net earnings of $686m, or 80 cents per diluted share, on a 9.5 per cent increase in sales to $14.62bn.Target also reported that earnings before tax from its large credit card business increased 34 per cent to $163m against the same period last year, in part due to an increase in late fees.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, said the retailer was not concerned about any increased strains on its credit card business as a result of the macro-economic environment. “We have a high degree of confidence in the continued health and prosperity of our credit card business.”
147;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-08-16T22:20:29Z;JC Penney upbeat amid retail gloom;;JC Penney, the US department store chain aimed at middle-income shoppers, on Thursday issued an upbeat earnings statement, in sharp contrast to both higher-end and bargain retailers which earlier this week said they were suffering from depressed consumer demand.The company narrowly beat analyst expectations with second-quarter earnings of $182m, or 78 cents a share, compared with $179m, or 75 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast earnings per share of 77 cents.Internet sales and the back-to-school season helped the company in “a challenging retail environment”, Myron Ullman III, chief executive, said.Other major retailers including discount-store Wal-Mart as well as Macy’s and Bloomingdales said their profits were hurt in the quarter by the continued housing market gloom and high fuel prices which are tightening consumers’ budgets. Both companies cut their full-year outlook, furthering concerns about market conditions.JC Penney raised its 2007 earnings-per-share forecast by a cent to $5.50.Fashion department store chain Nordstrom also reported second-quarter net profits just above analyst expectations on Thursday at $180.4m, up 6 per cent from a year earlier. Rival Kohl’s saw net profits rise 16 per cent to $269.2m.Online sales at JC Penney were particularly strong, jumping 17.4 per cent and offsetting a 2.3 per cent decrease in direct sales. Same-store sales increased 1.9 per cent in the quarter, which the company said was the seventeenth consecutive quarter with positive growth in comparable sales.The chain’s own brands, including lines by Liz Claiborne, contributed most to its sales performance, the company said.JC Penney’s share price was up 1.02 per cent to $63.21 by mid-afternoon.Analysts said the company fared better than other large retailers because of its successful long-term strategy.“JC Penney has been deft at flowing inventory from store to store and offering better style and quality at moderate prices,” said Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at Oppenheimer, noting that the company was “entering into a growth phase”.The company has sought to lure shoppers from former May Department Stores – which includes Filenes and Marshall Fields – whose prices were raised after it was acquired two years ago by Macy’s.JC Penney has been broadening its reach in the US market in recent years, securing space for its first Manhattan store in Herald Square, where it will be competing with Macy’s iconic flagship store.Founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney, the company re-emerged from near-bankruptcy in 1999. It operates 1,048 stores across the US with sales last year bringing in almost $20bn. It has pledged to accelerate its store opening programme, with 50 additional stores planned this year, up from 28 in 2006 and 18 in 2005.
148;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-08-16T20:40:48Z;Bargain hunters push S&P 500 higher;;US stocks closed mixed on Thursday after another volatile trading session in which financial stocks led a dramatic late rally.Countrywide, the beleaguered mortgage group, prompted an early plunge in stocks by saying it would have to draw on $11.5bn of credit and an official reports showed new homebuilding dropped to a 10-year low while building permits were at an 11-year low in July.But after the late rally, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.3 per cent higher at 1,411.26 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to close at 12,845.78. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.3 per cent at 2,451.07 and the Russell index of smaller companies was 2.3 per cent higher at 768.83.The Chicago Board Options Exchanges Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, soared to its highest level since 2002. The index finished 0.5 per cent higher at 30.83, having hit an early high of 37.50.The early market panic over the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis was exacerbated by William Poole, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve, who denied that the subprime issue pointed to a systemic crisis in the financial system and said only a “calamity” would justify an interest-rate cut.Markets were not calmed by a senior Federal Reserve spokesperson in Washington saying Mr Poole’s views were not representative of the central bank’s policymaking Open Market Committee as a whole.“While Fed officials are proceeding as if the calamity has yet to occur, it would appear that some in the market believe the calamity is simply yet to be fully appreciated,” said analysts at Interactive Brokers.In early trade, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell to more than 10 per cent below the 52-week highs they hit in mid-July. That is a drop investors usually define as a market correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to 9.5 per cent below its 52-week high.Nerves were not soothed by the Federal Reserve pumping more liquidity into the system on Thursday morning. The New York Fed announced an overnight repurchase agreement worth $12bn and a 14-day repurchase worth $5bn, while signalling that it expected to make similar repurchases on a more regular basis over the coming days.Attention continued to be focused on Countrywide Financial after the mortgage lender said it had been forced to tap an $11.5bn credit line to fund operations. It also had its ratings downgraded by Fitch and Moody’s. The shares were down 11 per cent by the close to $18.95, following a 13 per cent fall on Wednesday.Traders seized on a statement by Fannie Mae that it was in “constructive” talks with regulators about the need to lift its portfolio cap. Shares in the mortgage finance company rose by 6 per cent to $65.15. That lifted other financial stocks, with Bear Stearns up 12.9 per cent to $116.44, Lehman Brothers rising 6.2 per cent to $54.75 and Merrill Lynch up 3.2 per cent to $71.13.An hour before the opening bell, the Commerce Department released a gloomy report on US housing starts, showing that construction of new homes last month dropped to its lowest level in 10 years. The figures underlined the woes that have beset the homebuilding and mortgage sectors in recent weeks.Following disappointing quarterly earnings from other big retailers, JC Penney reported second-quarter financial results ahead of analysts’ estimates, with profit increasing 1.7 per cent to $182m, or 81 cents a share, from $179m, or 76 cents, for the same period last year. The retailer’s shares closed up 2.5 per cent at $64.14.Amgen was in the spotlight after the biotechnology company cut its profit guidance on lower-than-expected sales of its anaemia drug and said it planned to reduce its workforce by up to 14 per cent. Its shares dropped 2.3 per cent to $49.41.Cognex fell the most since October 2006, losing 11.9 per cent to $19.09. The maker of machine vision systems said third-quarter sales would be $50m-$55m, below analysts‘ average estimate of $58m.Lamson & Sessions posted its highest gain since 1980, rising 31.4 per cent to $25.80 after the maker of electrical outlet boxes agreed to a $27-a-share bid by Thomas & Betts, whose shares finished the trading day 3.7 per cent lower at $52.84.
149;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-08-09T20:44:29Z;Wall St plummets amid subprime fears;;Wall Street stocks plummeted in late trading on Thursday, closing sharply lower after another tumultuous trading session dominated by continuing concerns about the US mortgage market.The volatile session started lower in response to BNP Paribas’s earlier decision to suspend withdrawals from three funds with exposure to US credit markets. That decision had sent European stocks lower.By the end of trading, the S&P 500 was down 3 per cent, closing at a daily low of 1,453.09. The Nasdaq Composite also closed at a low for the daily, falling 2.2 per cent to 2,556.49.The Dow Jones Industrial Average – which at one point was down 300 points – closed marginally above its low for the day, 2.8 per cent down at 13,270.68.All 10 leading sectors in the S&P were lower, led by a 3.7 per cent slump in financial stocks.Wall Street banks were particularly hard hit, with the S&P investment bank index off 5.3 per cent.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” – surged 24 per cent to 26.59. It had earlier hit 26.90, its highest level since April 2003.Among leading benchmarks, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies held up the best, down 1.4 per cent at the close.BNP Paribas reported the problems at three of its funds, worth a combined $2bn. The announcement raised fears of contagion and the possibility of a global credit crunch.“The credit crisis is back on,” said TJ Marta, fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Several mutual fund managers have stopped redemptions from funds. NIBC, a Dutch bank, added to the gloom by reporting subprime-related losses of €137m and warned of further losses in the future.The European Central Bank added liquidity to the money market, as did the Federal Reserve.In the US, interest rate futures rose sharply and now price in a quarter percentage point easing in the Fed funds rate by September – up from odds of about 25 per cent on Wednesday.The latest credit woes sparked weaker US credit valuations and the yield on the two-year Treasury note had plunged 15 basis points to 4.59 per cent as investors sought a haven.Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said: “Problems of appropriately marking to market are likely to be systemic at least in the credit derivatives arena. And therein lies the problem. If [Federal Reserve chairman] Ben Bernanke was right in alluding to subprime losses at $50bn-$100bn, then only a small percentage appears to have surfaced so far and since he made those remarks, losses have likely extended across a much broader credit universe than subprime.”In earnings news, American International Group reported a 34 per cent rise in second-quarter profit. That exceeded expectations but the insurer warned that losses in its mortgage guaranty business were spreading from subprime to prime borrowers. AIG stock fell back 3.3 per cent to $64.30 following a gain of 1.4 per cent to $66.48 on Wednesday.Retail stocks were also in the spotlight as Home Depot announced that a deal to sell its wholesale business was being renegotiated and monthly sales figures for July were released.Shares in Home Depot fell the most in a year after it also said it might have to sell its supply unit for less than $10.3bn, the figure it had previously announced.The US’s largest home-improvement chain also announced it was lowering the price range for a stock buy-back to $37-$42 a share, from $39-$44. The company’s share price dropped 5.3 per cent to $35.79.Across the retailing sector, sales were up 2.9 per cent, in line with expectations at Thomson Financial, but below the 3.7 per cent rise in the same month last year.Wal-Mart’s same-store sales for the month ending August 3 rose 1.9 per cent, beating estimates of 1.5 per cent. Its shares were down 2.7 per cent at $47.10.Nordstrom, the high-end retailer, came in well ahead of expectations. The stock lost 1 per cent to close at $50.58.JC Penney also exceeded forecasts, reporting growth of 10.8 per cent, but its shares fell 6.3 per cent to $65.30.Shares in News Corpwere down 1.6 per cent at $22.44. The media group reported that fourth-quarter profit rose 4.5 per cent late on Wednesday.
150;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-06-07T22:33:14Z;Warm May lifts sales at US retailers;;Leading US chain retailers on Thursday reported solid sales in May, as warm weather released pent-up demand from a dismal April and helped offset continuing consumer concerns over petrol prices and the housing market.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 per cent for the month, supported by good performances by upmarket department stores and some speciality clothing retailers.Nordstrom, Saks and Bon Ton department stores all beat Wall Street forecasts. However, Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, missed market expectations for the fourth consecutive month, with a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, highlighting concerns about its integration of the former May’s Department stores it acquired in 2005.At JC Penney, comparable sales dropped 2 per cent, with it citing soft sales in jewellery, women’s accessories and household products, while sales at its rival Kohl’s saw a 10.5 per cent increase.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported a 7 per cent fall in same-store sales in North America, with sales at its Gap brand stores down 3 per cent. The retailer is pursuing a turnround while searching for a chief executive to replace Paul Pressler, who stepped down in January.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 0.3 per cent, although its Sam’s Club warehouse sales were up 5.4 per cent to give a total comparable sales increase of 1.1 per cent.Wal-Mart again said that its consumers continue to be troubled by rising petrol prices, which hit $3.20 during the month.The company said sales of clothing and home goods remained sluggish, but it expected to see improvements in the categories in its third quarter and “significant progress” in the fourth quarter. It said it expected sales in June to be between flat or up 2 per cent.Target, its smaller upmarket rival, said its same-store sales rose 5.8 per cent.
151;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-03-08T22:41:44Z;Wall St rallies on weaker yen;;The tentative recovery in US stocks gathered pace on Thursday as Wall Street cheered rising overseas markets and signs of improved corporate profits.The rally was given extra vigour by speculation that Citigroup might be attempting a further acquisition in Asia, while the weaker yen eased concerns about the global carry trade.However, the gains were checked in the afternoon as the spectre of subprime mortgage lenders returned to spook investors.Rumours that New Century Financial was close to bankruptcy weighed down the entire market and sent shares in the struggling subprime lender down 25 per cent to $3.87.Led by materials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks, the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to close at 1,401.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 12,260.70. The Dow was boosted by AT&T, which rose 3.1 per cent to $36.51 after analysts at AG Edwards lifted their rating on the telecoms company from “hold” to “buy”.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,387.73.Retailers gave a mixed set of trading updates for February but investors largely reacted positively, sending the S&P retailers index up 1.2 per cent. Wal-Mart shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $47.88 after its underlying sales growth last month fell short of analysts’ estimates.Shares in Costco were also on the defensive after the retailer said second quarter profits had declined because of charges related to stock options. The group’s shares fell 3.3 per cent to $54.26.However, while trading in February was also sluggish at JC Penney, its shares surged 4.1 per cent to $81.86 after the retailer said sales in March would rise sharply.Shares in Ford rose 4 per cent to $7.93 after Credit Suisse analysts raised their rating on the group from “underperform” to “neutral”, saying the carmaker’s first quarter loss might be smaller than expected.Steelmakers made big gains after Nucor said it saw “healthy demand” for its products, sending its shares up 5.3 per cent to $63.12.In deal news, an executive of Taiwan’s Bank of Overseas Chinese said Citigroup would buy the bank “very soon”. Shares in Citigroup pared early gains to stand 0.6 per cent up at $50.50.The battle for Caremark heated up after Express Scripts raised its hostile offer for its larger rival in the US drug benefits management sector by offering to pay interest on the cash component of its $26.1bn bid.The sweetened bid comes as Express tries to trump the deal already agreed between Caremark and pharmacy chain CVS. In response CVS on Thursday increased the dividend it intends to pay Caremark shareholders.CVS stock rose 3.3 per cent to $54.26. Shares in Caremark and Express rose by 1.4 and 1.7 per cent respectively to $62.16 and $76.
152;JWN;Nordstrom;2007-03-08T15:09:44Z;US stores feel chill in February sales;;Bitterly cold winter weather across the central and northeastern US weighed on US retailers during February, as stores started to make the transition from winter to spring merchandise.Retailers including Wal-Mart and Federated Deparment Stores, the owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdales, cited the impact of bad weather as they reported lower than expected growth in like-for-like sales.Wal-Mart said sales at its discount stores, its core business, rose just 0.4 per cent, and that it continued to suffer from sluggish sales of clothing and soft furnishings.Federated said like-for-like sales were up 1.2 per cent, missing its target of 2 to 3 per cent growth.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, predicted sales growth of 1 to 2 per cent for March, in spite of despite an early Easter holiday which is expected to boost sales in the month.Its performance in February was again overshadowed by Target, its smaller rival, which reported same store sales growth of 5.7 per cent, and forecast growth of between 4 and 6 per cent over March and April.Wal-Mart’s sales statement also drew attention to its planned expansion of a service that allows orders made online at Walmart.com to be picked up in its stores. Last year, it stopped offering a “lay-away” service, popular with low-income shoppers, that allowed customers to hold a product by making an initial downpayment.It expects the service, which executives believe could drive same store sales, to be operating in all its US stores by the summer. Walmart.com is the third most popular retailer website, after Amazon and Ebay, and attracts a more prosperous cross-section of customers than the main stores. The retailer does not break out its online sales figures.Reviewing the overall February sales figures, Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said his index for same store sales rose 2.8 per cent for the month, against the 3.1 per cent forecast.He said the weather factor was a “legitimate reason” for the softness across the industry.He also noted that February was traditionally the least important month for retailers as they cleared winter merchandise and brought in spring styles, and that conditions should improve in March with the arrival of warmer weather and the early Easter.The sluggish overall picture was offset by strong performances from both Saks, the luxury department store, which reported a 24.7 per cent increase in same store sales this week, and its rival Nordstrom, which beat forecasts with 9.1 per cent growth.Pier 1 Imports, the home furnishings store, reported its 12th consecutive month of same store sales declines, with an 8 per cent fall.The retailer has suffered seven consecutive quarters of losses. and last year announced it was interested in a possible buy-out. last year. However, in January it appointed a new chief executive, Alex Smith, a former executive at TJX, the cut price retailer.

Sales at its US store network rose 1.3 per cent.Wal-Mart said that it had seen a “very strong performance” in electronics, where it launched an aggressive series of price-cuts at the start of November. But it said that apparel and home sales had been “soft” as expected, although price cuts in apparel had helped to boost sales. Target, Wal-Mart’s leading competitor, reported sales growth of 4.5 per cent, in the middle of its own forecast range, but below Wall Street’s average estimate.Retailers’ holiday sales are vital because the two months before Christmas can make up for 20 to 40 per cent of annual sales.Costco, the warehouse club that compete’s with Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, delivered a 9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales, beating analyst’s forecasts of 5.7 per cent growth. Sam’s Club sales rose 5.6 per cent. But BJs, the third largest warehouse club, saw its shares drop 14 per cent after it reported sales growth of just 0.6 per cent, and cut its profit forecast.Gap said same-store sales fell 8 per cent, a worse figure than expected, despite swingeing price cuts designed to bring shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores. Out of all of its brands and regions only Banana Republic in the US and Canada reported sales growth, with an increase of 2 per cent on last year. In North America Gap and Old Navy saw sales fall 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, and internationally sales fell by 8 per cent.The struggling retailer also cut its outlook and said it was reviewing its brand strategies for Gap and Old Navy.Department stores delivered a mixed picture. Saks and Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department stores, saw sales jump 11.1 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, both roundly beating Wall Street forecasts.But Federated Department Stores owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said sales at its stores, excluding the May stores acquired in 2005, rose by 4.4 per cent, below its own forecast. The company said sales at more than 300 former May Department Store locations, which have been converted to the Macy’s banner since their acquisition in 2005, “remained weak”, without giving details.JC Penney said same store sales increased 2.6 per cent in December, beating analysts’ expecations of 2.4 per cent and last year’s figure of 2.2 per cent. Children’s clothing and jewellry proved popular with shoppers. Its rival Kohl’s saw sales rise 3.4 per cent, below forecasts.AnnTaylor, another major apparel seller, said it had suffered a 5.3 per cent drop in same-store sales and said its full-year earnings will come in lower than its original guidance of $2.07 to $2.12 a share.Pier 1, the home-furnishings retailer, saw a 10.7 per cent drop in same-store sales, even worse than the 9.4 per cent fall Wall Street had anticipated.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, saw a 4 per cent gain, well below the 9.3 per cent Wall Street expected.Zale said sales increased by 2.3 per cent for the combined months of November and December. It said profit margins were lower than expected because of price cutting.American Eagle Outfitters, the teen apparel retailer, said on Wednesday that same store sales grew 13 per cent for the month, beating Wall Street’s expectations for 8.7 per cent growth.
155;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wal-Mart suffers for its fashion mistakes;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday issued a sombre forecast for sales in December, blaming mis-steps in its efforts to introduce more fashionable and expensive clothing and home furnishings into its low-cost discount stores.The retailer said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow by no more than 1 per cent, after comparable sales fell by 0.1 per cent in November – the first drop since 1996.The company cited continued problems with its home and clothing categories, where its core customers have not responded well to its drive to introduce goods such as the Metro 7 women’s clothing range across its entire store network.Eduardo Castro-Wright, chief executive of Wal-Mart’s US stores division, said: “The home and apparel business is challenging and this will continue throughout the fourth quarter.” He noted that basic items in both categories continued to sell well.The company said it did not expect to see improvements in both categories until spring.The drive to persuade more prosperous customers to buy more than food and basics at the stores has been the focus of an overhaul of the retailer’s marketing strategy over the past year – sometimes at the expense of its traditional low-price message.Mr Castro-Wright said the retailer’s pre-Christmas marketing would focus on “communicating price leadership” and that it would deliver further price cuts in the run-up to the holidays.Wal-Mart’s poor performance in November contrasted with Target, its more upmarket rival, which reported a 5.9 per cent increase in comparable store sales, and predicted growth of 3.5-5.5 per cent for December.Overall, leading US retailers reported a subdued November. Retail Metrics said its monthly index of same store sales growth rose 2.2 per cent, and that more than half the retailers reporting missed their forecast numbers.Several clothing retailers cited the impact of unseasonably warm November weather on sales of winter clothing, and this was also cited as a negative factor by Ann Taylor, the women’s clothing retailer, and Kohls, the low cost department store.The big three traditional department store chains, however, again delivered above-average performances. Federated said November same-store sales rose 8.5 per cent at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores, and raised its estimate for December sales. Saks and Nordstrom saw sales growth of 7.2 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, saw its sales woes continue at its Gap and Old Navy stores. The group’s overall same store sales were down 8 per cent, and total net sales slipped 2 per cent to $1.4bn.

Federated beat sales but fell 3.9 per cent to $41.35 on a weaker sales outlook. Saks also enjoyed good sales and rose 1.5 per cent to $19.48“It’s striking that the discounters are seeing disappointing sales, while high-end retailers are holding up,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.Beyond monthly sales figures, he believes the real test for the consumer will come when a spillover from the slowing housing market into job creation occurs. “The consumer will follow the economy into a slowdown, not lead it.”The next test for stocks will be the October employment report on Friday.The S&P 500 settled 0.47 points, or 0.03 per cent, lower at 1,367.34, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.33 points, or 0.01 per cent, lower at 2,334.02.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 12.48 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,018.54, having earlier slipped below 12,000.To date, 385 of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings, with 74 per cent above estimates, according to Thomson Financial.Earnings for the third quarter are running 18.6 per cent higher versus a year ago, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Shares in Intel were off their lows, down 1.6 per cent at $20.68, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the chipmaker from “buy” to “neutral” amid weakening demand and persistent excess capacity.

158;JWN;Nordstrom;2006-09-14T19:11:25Z;Nordstrom opens door to expansion;;Nordstrom, the US fashion department store, has indicated it will take advantage of the current wave of retail consolidation to accelerate growth of its network of almost 100 full-line stores.After being regarded five years ago as a potential takeover target, Mike Koppel, chief financial officer, said Nordstrom was eyeing real estate opportunities created by recent consolidation, including the merger of Federated and May department stores, and the restructuring at Saks.“If we look at the pipeline of opportuntiies and what’s out there, I don’t think we’ve been in a period ever where there’s that much opportunity for us,” he said in an interview.Nordstrom, which is expected to have sales of around $8.3bn this year, has moved to expand its square footage at the comparatively cautious rate of 2-3 per cent since the founding Nordstrom family reasserted control over its day-to-day management in 2001.At the time, the company’s sales and share price had slumped due to a series of missteps under a non-family management team, leading to speculation that the retailer might be taken over by rivals such as Federated, Dillard’s or May.Under Blake Nordstrom, president, and a great-grandchild of the founder John Nordstrom – who set up the store on money gained in the Klondike gold rush – the retailer has recorded positive same store sales for the past three-and-a half years.Its stores have sales per square foot of $369, second only to Neiman Marcus, the smaller luxury chain. They are known for features such as live piano music, and fishtanks in the children’s department to distract the younger clientele.Mr Koppel declined to give a figure for potential square footage growth, but said that Nordstrom as “still maintaining a very disciplined approach”. He also noted that the company is also benefitting from being regarded as an attractive potential anchor client for malls.Last year, Nordstrom secured $49.5m in upfront incentives from mall operators, up from around $20m the previous year.In addition to store expansion, the retailer is also planning to add additional designer selections to some of its stores, and to double the value of its its online sales from almost $500m this year, to over $1bn in the next four to six years.Mr Koppel noted that direct, mostly online sales were expected to increase by 25 per cent this year, despite the closure of the retailer’s separate catalogue business, which stocked merchandise that was often different from that available in its stores.The retailer, he said, will spend $50m on expanding its distribution centre to handle online sales, and $30m-$50m on new technolgy to unify its instore and online inventory management.“We want to have our merchandise strategy being driven by our full-line stores, and then complement that with an offering on line,” he said.“It’s a way for us to extend our brand, and to get access to customers that don’t have physical access. So as we continue to expand physically, we already have a presence in the customer’s mind.“In addition to Blake, there are three other Nordstrom family members in the retailer’s senior executive ranks. Blake’s father, Bruce, was chairman of the board until May, when he retired and was replaced by Rick Hernandez, and the family controls around 20 per cent of the company’s shares.

Releases included revised gross domestic product figures, consumer confidence and consumer spending figures, and minutes from the Federal Reserve’s August meeting showing that Fed members believed inflation would slowly decline. Markets responded nervously, trading in and out of negative territory on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.But there was an unambiguous reaction to Friday’s jobs report, which showed payrolls rising fractionally more than expected in August, prompting a rally.“I don’t know what’s not to like [about the week’s data],” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.“There are some pretty good employment and spending numbers. It’s about as solid as you’re going to get.”Crude oil sold off during the week, at one point dipping to a 10-week low of $68.45, as fear premiums were unwound when traders realised that tropical storm Ernesto would hit Florida and not oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.The crude slump was felt acutely by energy stocks, which made up seven of the week’s 10 worst performing stocks in the S&P 500.Refiners were hard hit, and the S&P Oil and Gas Refining and Marketing index fell 7.1 per cent, its worst week since February.Marathon Oil sank 7.7 per cent to $84.99 and Sunoco lost 6.1 per cent to $72.60.Semiconductors, on the other hand, made broad advances.PMC Sierra gained 9.6 per cent to $6.72, and LSI Logic rose 7.4 per cent to $8.01.

But Ken Perkins, president, noted that the 52 per cent of retailers who exceeded market forecasts represented a fourth consecutive month in which the number had fallen.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, noted that overall sales growth had slowed over the first six months of the year.“We have seen some moderation: not dramatic and it’s very uneven. But there’s enough to say there’s something going on and that something is likely to continue for the rest of the year.”In possible signs of the stress on middle-income consumers, Target, the second largest US discounter, missed Wall Street’s sales target for the second consecutive month. Target, whose customers have a median family income of $58,000, reported a 2.8 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, against the 3.1 per cent expected by analysts.The company said home decoration items as well as women’s clothing, costume jewellery and accessories were its weakest categories.JC Penney, the mid-range department store with a similar customer demographic to Target, also surprised analysts with a 0.5 per cent fall in August comparable store sales, citing slow sales of big-ticket items, including furniture - echoing comments from Costco, the warehouse shopping club.Dollar General, which operates 8,000 small-format discount stores across the US, gave one of the starkest indications of the state of the battle for the hard-pressed lower income consumer. The retailer said lower sales of home products and clothing had contributed to a 40 per cent fall in its profits during the second quarter.“We also expect consumer discretionary spending to continue to be negatively affected by high fuel prices and by higher interest rates as well,” the retailer said. It added that it expected “aggressive marketing and discounted pricing by competitors” to continue.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said its overall August sales rose 2.5 per cent at its US discount stores and 3.5 per cent at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores.But the continued strength of the higher end of the market was demonstrated by Nordstrom, the fashion department store, which recorded a 7.1 per cent increase in August comparable store sales, against the 3.6 per cent expected by analysts.

The fall came after it lowered its full-year forecast for net interest income growth due to rising competition and interest rate pressures. The bank said credit losses could rise due to a $200m non-performing loan.Dillard’s, the department store, jumped 5.6 per cent to $33.08 after it swung to a $15.7m profit in the second quarter from a loss in the same period last year. Nordstrom, which reports earnings on Thursday, gained 1.5 per cent to $34.81, while Federated Department Stores gained 2.7 per cent to $36.90.
163;JWN;Nordstrom;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
164;JWN;Nordstrom;2006-08-10T19:57:18Z;Target optimistic on ‘back-to-school’ sales;;Target and JC Penney on Thursday said there had been a good start to the key “back-to-school” selling season, despite concerns expressed by rival US retailers that high energy prices and a weakening housing market were hitting sales.Recent US economic data suggest that consumer spending is set to slow, but the impact has been more muted on discounters and department stores, as well as high-end retailers such as Nordstrom.Target, the second-largest US discount retailer by revenues after Wal-Mart, said it was comfortable with existing full-year earnings as strong early-summer sales and an expanding credit-card business overcame the impact of higher selling costs and an aggressive store expansion programme.Investors had been concerned after the company’s same-store sales growth fell to 3.1 per cent in July from 6.7 per cent a year earlier, and Wal-Mart has said high fuel prices were forcing shoppers to make fewer trips and focus on essential purchases. “We are pleased with our back-to-school business,” said Bob Ulrich, Target’s chairman and chief executive officer, although he stressed it was still early in the season.Target operates about 1,500 stores in the US and has a more affluent demographic than Wal-Mart, but is boosting the amount of food in its outlets, a move that hit gross margins in the first quarter.Margins rose slightly in the latest period from what analysts viewed as a tough year-ago comparison,The company pointed to tighter inventory management as it reported a rise in net profits from $540m to $609m in the quarter to July 29, with sales up 11.3 to $13.35bn. It has also adjusted pricing after a shift towards some more expensive product lines forced additional discounting in the previous quarter.Same-store sales growth – from outlets open for more than a year – reached 4.6 per cent in the quarter, but the company expressed confidence in maintaining its long-term average of around 5 per cent, above that achieved by Wal-Mart.The company has said it could double or even triple its existing store base, with selling space growing around 8 per cent a year.JC Penney reflected the continuing strength of the department-store sector – helped by the hot weather, which drew customers indoors – by raising its earnings’ guidance for the third quarter and full year. Net profits in the July quarter rose from $131 to $179m, with same-store sales up 6.6 per cent.

Its shares fell 13 per cent to $44.32. St Jude Medical tumbled 10.9 per cent to $33.70 and Boston Scientific shed 7.7 per cent to $16.27.Starbucks sank 8 per cent to $30.64. After the bell on Wednesday, the coffee chain reported a 16 per cent rise in third-quarter profits. However, sales growth for July fell below levels from a year ago due to staffing problems as consumers ordered more labour-intensive iced drinks.Procter & Gamble added 2 per cent to $59.45 after rival consumer products group Unilever disappointed analysts with lower margins.Prudential Financial slid 5.9 per cent to $73.66 after it missed analyst estimates and reported a 43 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings due to falling income at its insurance division.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.72 points, at 1,280.27, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent, or 13.53 points, at 2,092.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent, or 42.66 points, at 11,242.59.Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach believes two factors helped pull the major indices back into positive territory.“There was some short covering ahead of tomorrow’s [Friday] employment data. There also seems to be some good indications that the Middle East violence might be coming to an end.”Technology staged a rally. Advanced Micro Devices gained 4.3 per cent to $20.45 following a bullish analyst comment on the stock, while Ebay added 4.7 per cent to $24.07. Google gained 2.2 per cent to $375.39.Nordstrom and Limited Brands both pushed higher after their same-store sales for July beat Wall Street forecasts. Nordstrom gained 6.8 per cent to $35.62 and Limited added 5.4 per cent to $25.81.However, the real drag on the consumer sector was in casino stocks. Las Vegas Sands posted solid profit growth thanks to a strong performance at its Macau casino, but revenue fell below analysts’ expectations, pushing shares down 6.9 per cent to $60.81.MGM Mirage also sold off, losing 7.1 per cent to $35.31, after second-quarter earnings fell shy of Wall Street forecasts.

Discount retailer Target warned that it expected lower sales than it had previously forecast. AG Edwards cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “hold”. The shares fell 4.3 per cent to $45.03, its worst day since November.The gloom spread to other retailers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent, or 51.87 points, at 10,799.23.“We did see a big pull back in the price of crude. That fed into investors’ psyches,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.Investors reacted coolly to Merrill Lynch, which fell 1.1 per cent to $67.50 despite reporting a 44 per cent rise in second-quarter profits – more than expected. There were fears about a fall in revenues from the first quarter and the future trading outlook for the brokerage.Investors also seemed less enthusiastic about United Technologies, which ann-ounced a better-than-expected 14 per cent rise in earnings. The shares, however, gained only 1.6 per cent to $58.88.Coca-Cola climbed a modest 2 per cent to $43.55, despite reporting a 7 per cent increase in quarterly profit ahead of forecasts.The focus is likely to remain on earnings as more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 report this week.According to Thomson Financial, the blended growth rate – a composite figure created using a combination of estimates and earnings reported so far – stands at 12.3 per cent. Should the growth rate for this second quarter finish above 10 per cent, it would mark the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500.The producer price index rose 0.5 per cent in June, up from 0.2 per cent in May and significantly ahead of the flat level that had been expected by analysts. The core PPI, which strips out food and energy prices, grew 0.2 per cent.Engineering group ITT Industries gained 4.8 per cent to $47.69 after Merrill Lynch changed its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, saying the company was well placed to weather a consumer downturn.

168;JWN;Nordstrom;2006-07-07T19:50:13Z;Coach puts Midwest destinations on the timetable;;As Angela Ahrendts steers Burberry’s wagons towards the retail heartlands of the US Midwest, she will be following the footsteps of early brand pioneers who saw potential in the untapped aspirations of prosperous middle America.Coach, the handbag and accessory maker that describes itself as an “accessible luxury lifestyle brand”, is this month due to open its first store in Evansville, Indiana – the state’s third-largest city.Evansville is a quintessential midwest city - with a population of 300,000, it is described by its Convention and Visitors’ Bureau as a place where “residents offer a smile and hello as they pass”.Coach’s move into Evansville is part of a dramatic national expansion that has seen the company almost doubling its US store base over the past five years to 193 stores, including mid-sized cities such as Columbus, Ohio and the Overland Park suburb of Kansas City.This year Coach’s plans include new stores in Oklahoma City, Albany in upstate New York, and Omaha, Nebraska – none of them known as fashion centres.But Coach remains an “upscale” rather than a luxury brand – its bags and products are cheaper than Burberry, which currently only has about 35 stores in the US.“To be unique and exclusive you can’t be ubiquitous,” says Milton Pedraza, of the Luxury Institute. “There’s a fine line, and if you go into these smaller cities, I think you can cross that line.”Neiman Marcus, the elite department store that stocks Burberry’s handbag range, continues to focus on following the big money – this year it opened just two more stores in swanky Boca Raton, Florida, and in San Antonio, one of the most prosperous cities in Texas.However, both Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue - the upmarket department stores that are Neiman’s closest rivals – could provide Burberry with the kind of location anchors that the retailer will be looking for in cities such as Cincinnatti and Indianapolis.Burberry’s US consumers, meanwhile, remain largely unaware of the “Chav” related brand-challenges faced by Burberry in its home market in the UK.In her push into the hinterlands, Ms Ahrendts will have to decide just how far she wants to go.

That stigma is starting to fade.”He noted that the company was continuing its efforts to develop its online presence, to build on internet sales of just over $1bn last year – making it one of the leading online retailers.Current initiatives included seeking a planned new relationship that would place QVC’s online content on AOL’s web portal and efforts to make its video available to support online shopping.The company, whose performance in the UK, Germany and Japan accounts for about a third of its sales, is due to launch a service providing video to mobile phone subscribers in the UK later this year. This follows the launch of a similar scheme in Japan last year.
171;JWN;Nordstrom;2006-01-05T18:49:47Z;US retailers post modest sales gains;;US retailers reported solid holiday sales boosted by a late shopping surge and big markdowns. But a profit warning from Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, raised concerns about the impact deep discounting could have on earnings.Wal-Mart expects fourth-quarter profits to come in at the low end of its forecast of 82-86 cents a share. Kohl’s, the mid-priced department store, also lowered estimates.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics research, said the margin impact of the promotional activity app-eared to have hurt some retailers, but the lower earnings guidance was “not as significant as many had feared”.Analysts were watching December sales as consumers delayed shopping until late in the month, with many opting for gift cards. Retailers book the revenue from the cards when they are redeemed, not when they are sold, which usually boosts January sales. Gift cards accounted for an estimated 15-18 per cent of consumer spending this holiday season.There were also fears about Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday, starting late, the lack of hot “must-have” items and whether the transit strike in New York would hurt the city’s big retailers.Overall sales rose 3.4 per cent, said Mr Perkins, better than his 3.1 per cent forecast. Factoring out Wal-Mart, sales were up 4.3 per cent. Sixty-four per cent of the Retail Metrics index beat expectations.Wal-Mart confirmed that December same-store sales – from stores open at least a year – rose 2.2. per cent, its weakest December sales increase in five years. The mediocre gain is a blow to the retailer in the wake of an aggressive holiday marketing campaign launched early in the season after it stumbled in 2004.Sales at Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, rose 3.4 per cent, beating expectations.“We are pleased with Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s performance in December, despite disruptions caused by the . . . strike the week before Christmas,” said Terry Lundgren, Federated’s chief executive.The biggest positive surprise came from Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen speciality retailer, which reported a 29 per cent jump in sales. The gain was impressive as most of its merchandise was sold at full price during a season of markdowns. Aeropostale, another teen retailer, surpassed expectations with a rise of 11.4 per cent against expectations of 4.4 per cent.Sales at Target, Wal-Mart’s discount rival, rose 4.7 per cent, while Nordstrom, a luxury retailer, beat expectations with a gain of 7.7 per cent. At Gap, the floundering apparel retailer, sales tumbled 9 per cent – worse than the forecast 3.8 per cent decline.
172;JWN;Nordstrom;2005-12-01T18:24:00Z;US store sales at low end of forecasts;;US shoppers failed to respond as strongly as expected in November to lower petrol prices, favourable weather and deep discounting, raising doubts for retailers about the remainder of the holiday season.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics research, said the same-store sales figures released on Thursday by big US chains were “a little bit disappointing, given all the positive factors”.Mike Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said results from 65 chain stores showed an average sales increase at stores open at least a year of 3.5 per cent, against the ICSC’s forecast of 3.5 to 4 per cent.“It was a promotional month, and those doing the strongest promotions got the sales. The question is: at what cost for the companies? And how do the sales continue into the post-Thanksgiving period, where there is a traditional lull in sales?”He also said there were concerns about a pattern of spending that seemed to have concentrated spending towards retailers offering aggressively low prices, while other areas, such as upmarket department stores, had seen slower growth than previously.“There’s still a lingering concern about the consumer’s willingness to spend,” he said.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, issued a relatively subdued forecast for its December sales of 2 to 4 per cent, after reporting 4.3 per cent growth in same-store sales in November.The retailer’s same-store sales growth outstripped Target, its main discount rival, for the first time this year. Target said its sales at stores open at least a year increased by 2.6 per cent, in line with reduced forecasts made earlier in the month.Sales at Wal-Mart’s Supercenters and discount stores were up 3.8 per cent, while sales at its Sam’s Club discount warehouses were up 7 per cent. For the year so far, Wal-Mart’s Supercenter and discount same store sales are up 3.4 per cent, against Target’s 5.8 per cent.This year, Wal-Mart launched its holiday marketing campaign on November 1, two weeks earlier than last year, when it reported a disappointing 0.7 per cent rise in US same-store sales.Other retailers issued a mixed set of sales results for November, with traditional department stores producing disappointing figures.Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said same-store sales fell 3.4 per cent, the biggest drop in more than two years. Kohl’s, Nordstrom, Dillard’s and Saks all performed more weakly than expected. Gap reported a 4 per cent drop in same-store sales, which included a 5 per cent drop at its Gap brand US stores.
173;JWN;Nordstrom;2005-10-26T17:44:31Z;The measure of a great employer;;Being a consistently great employer is not easy. But four companies, including Goldman Sachs, enjoy the rare distinction of ­having ranked among the 100 best places to work in the US for each of the past 21 years.The other three are AG Edwards, a Saint Louis-based stockbroker, Nordstrom, a Seattle shoe shop that grew into a national fashion retail chain, and WL Gore, a Delaware-based manufacturer of speciality chemical products such as Gore-Tex fabrics.In an era when business is more often seen as a villain than a hero, what makes these employers special? Part of the answer lies in their age. AG Edwards, Goldman Sachs and Nordstrom are all more than 100 years old. WL Gore, a spring chicken by comparison, is approaching its half-century.“Companies which have been around for a long time have strong sets of values that result in employees being treated well,” says Milton Moskowitz, who – along with Robert Levering – started a pioneering survey in 1984 ranking the 100 best companies to work for.“They have great benefits. They sack people only as a last resort. They tend to have CEOs who serve for a great many years. As a result, they score very well on the survey because their employees are so positive.”Characteristics like these echo the findings of Built to Last, the 1990s bestseller by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, and Mr Collins’ 2001 follow-up, Good to Great. The 18 “visionary companies” that featured in Built to Last were all founded in the 150 years to 1945. They included Nordstrom, founded in 1901, and Procter & Gamble, founded in 1837, which appeared in both the original and most recent rankings of America’s best workplaces.Like the strong values that Mr Moskowitz mentions, the authors of Built to Last found that their 18 companies had a core purpose that went beyond profit. By holding to this purpose, sometimes to the detriment of short-term financial gains, they created better long-term shareholder returns.In Good to Great, Mr Collins found that chief executives who turned average companies into stellar stock market performers tended to be humble, unobtrusive and determined. They were not pushy or boastful, and that is largely true of the chief executives of America’s best workplaces, says Mr Moskowitz, a veteran ­California-based business journalist.Great workplaces exude a sense of fairness. “They tend not to be the outrageous examples you see in newspapers of CEOs with incredibly high salaries compared to the average workforce,” he says. “Whole Foods Market, a very successful natural foods supermarket chain, has a salary cap so the CEO is not allowed to make more than 14 times the average salary of full-timers. Cisco Systems and Microsoft give stock options, not just to top management but to everybody in the company.”He recalls how Goldman Sachs reserved about a fifth of the shares for its workforce when it went public. “The highest paid secretaries on Wall Street work at Goldman,” he says. At WL Gore, a privately held company, the only job title is “associate”. Employees who become “leaders” are evaluated by those they lead.Mr Collins’ books focused on public companies. By contrast, about 40 per cent of the “best companies to work for” are private. Family-owned businesses can do extraordinary, even bizarre, things for their employees that shareholders of public companies would not tolerate. Take SC Johnson, the manufacturer of Pledge polish, Glade air freshener and Raid insecticide. In the late 1980s, it chartered a Boeing 747 to fly its 400 UK employees to its headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin, to spend Christmas with US employees so that they felt part of the corporate family. It later did the same for Australian and Canadian staff.Family roots help explain why some public companies such as Nordstrom have consistently scored highly as workplaces. “The family were originally Swedish immigrants. They are still there, even though it is a big publicly-held company. They answer their own phones,” says Mr Moskowitz.Sales staff are trusted to make decisions about how to treat customers well. “They say that, because they were originally a shoe store, they are used to serving the customer on bended knee.”The ranking provides evidence that a good company to work for is a good company to invest in. If you had bought stock in all the public companies in the list in 1998, when it was first published by Fortune magazine, and held it until 2005, you would have made twice the annualised return of the S&P 500 Index, he says. If you had sold each year and reinvested in the new list, you would have made three times the S&P return.Like some of the best companies he has studied, Mr Moskowitz has been around for a long time and has seen many changes. Now 78, he began to write about companies’ role in society after the 1960s civil rights campaigns. Together with Mr Levering, he put together the first list for a book, The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America, published in 1984. They visited 117 “socially minded” companies in 29 states, interviewing up to two dozen employees in each. The lists are based on company submissions and confidential staff surveys.Six companies were dropped when the paperback edition came out in 1985. They included Walt Disney and Merck, which had both had strikes, and Philip Morris, which was on an acquisition spree to diversify out of tobacco, making it difficult to track workplace conditions across the group. Others have gone because they were acquired or sacked large numbers of employees, as Levi Strauss and Hewlett- Packard did, in an attempt to address tough competition or a business downturn.Inclusion in the ranks is no proof of perfection: Enron featured for two years before its collapse. Employees sometimes tell Mr Moskowitz and Mr Levering that they have misjudged a company. They investigate and seek a response from the company. Sometimes companies are dropped.In recent years, the idea of the best workplace list has spread, with 3,000 companies now participating in 25 countries, including Brazil, India and South Korea. Japan is due to launch one soon. The Great Place to Work Institute, which was founded by Mr Levering and Amy Lyman, a behavioural scientist, and which now compiles the lists, has administrative and media partners in different countries. The Financial Times is the media partner for the UK and European Union lists.When they started out, Mr Moskowitz says he and Mr Levering doubted there were enough US companies to qualify for the title. “We still think most companies are not good places to work,” he says. “But it has been encouraging and interesting to watch the changes.”The development of flexible working has been a big change. So has the loss of job security. Sixteen companies in the 1984 list had “no lay-off” policies. “Now you can hardly find anyone on the list with such a policy.”Meanwhile, globalisation has reduced the importance of the ranking for multinationals that have cut jobs at home and outsourced manufacturing to factories elsewhere. “I think it would have to get into monitoring labour standards abroad to survive long-term,” says Mr Moskowitz.Also, some big companies have begun to resent being judged against smaller entrants. “They feel the odds are stacked against them,” he says. “Even if their benefits are great, small companies have a cohesiveness, a feeling of belonging and an enthusiasm that they can’t match.” Being a large publicly owned employer, and being consistently great, is hardest of all.GREAT EMPLOYERS:■ Trust their staff to make the right decisions.■ Take customer service seriously.■ Cut jobs only as a last resort.■ Share rewards with everyone, not just senior management.■ Tend to have longer-serving chief executives.■ Offer benefits well beyond what is required by law.■ Respond to emerging trends, such as demands for flexible working, or networks for minorities.■ Have been around long enough to establish a strong culture and sense of belonging.

175;JWN;Nordstrom;2005-08-05T20:57:15Z;Profit-taking erases weekly gains on Wall St;;Gains for US stocks at the start of the week had evaporated by Friday following a bout of profit-taking after the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 tested four-year highs.With oil prices hitting record highs following the death of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, some analysts were concerned about the long term outlook for the equity markets.“I worry about oil. I started worrying when it hit $45,” said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. The question is how long consumer confidence can remain positive and how much oil prices will cut into profits, he said.By the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.8 per cent from Thursday’s close at 1,226.42, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent at 10,578.03 and the Nasdaq was down 0.6 per cent at 2,177.91.The three indicators were all down over the week, with the Nasdaq down 0.3 per cent, the S&P 500 0.6 per cent lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.8 per cent.But strong fundamentals in the US economy continue to drive analysts’ growth expectations in the equity markets long term. Both US manufacturing data and employment figures released this week surprised the markets.“The employment numbers feed into the good news that the economy is okay and possibly getting stronger,” said Mr Hyman, adding that the earnings picture over the past two weeks has helped positive momentum.With corporate earnings reports winding down, equity markets are turning their attention toward the Federal Reserve policy meeting next Tuesday.Although the market expects the Fed to raise rates by another 25 basis points to 3.5 per cent, many analysts are viewing this as a pivotal meeting where Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan may indicate a slowing in the current tightening cycle.Merger and acquisition activity continued when German athletic goods company Adidas agreed to acquire sporting goods rival Reebok for $3.8bn. The newly formed company would become the second largest in the sector in terms of market share and would challenge the largest company in the sector, Nike.The market welcomed the acquisition announcement, pushing shares of Reebok up 32.5 per cent on the week to $56.67.Meanwhile, the week saw the end to the CNOOC saga, as the Chinese oil company dropped its bid for Unocal. Chevron, the other oil company in the bidding war with CNOOC, pushed up 4.2 per cent to $60.46, while Unocal was up 0.5 per cent to $65.00Diversified manufacturer Tyco International dropped sharply after the company reported earnings above analysts’ expectations, but lowered its outlook for the full year. The company cited rising steel prices as the reason for falling profits at its industrial businesses. The stock dropped 10.5 per cent over the week to $27.26.The retail sector struggled this week following disappointing July sales figures from the likes of GAP and Nordstrom. Wal-Mart, however, said that July retail sales rose more than 4 per cent.After gaining more than 50 per cent over the past year, Nordstrom dropped 11 per cent on the week to $32.48. GAP was down 2.7 per cent to $20.53 and Wal-Mart was up 0.3 per cent to $49.52.The mixed results made some analysts ask if it was high oil prices that had started to chip away at the consumer’s disposable income.But US car manufacturers released figures showing an improvement in July sales, on the back of some generous discount offers over the past few months. General Motors, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler all said that July sales surged.The shares were mixed, with GM down 2.9 per cent on the week to $35.77, Ford off 2.2 per cent to $10.50 but DaimlerChrysler up 2.1 per cent to $49.45.Media stocks stayed active with media conglomerates Time Warner and Viacom reporting earnings. Time Warner was up 5.3 per cent on the week to $18.00 and Viacom was up 1.6 per cent to $34.04.
176;JWN;Nordstrom;2005-08-04T20:34:35Z;Wall Street falls amid mixed retail sales;;Shares on Wall Street ended lower on Thursday after retail sales from many US companies disappointed the market and investors took profits on gains earlier in the week.Despite the blip over the past two days, many investors remain bullish about equities in the near term as US economic fundamentals continue to come in strong.“People forget that this bull market is 34 months old, and at this age it can’t rock and roll like it did a couple of years ago,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “It’s not going to be able to rise every day.”By the close of trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 10,610.10. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,191.32 and the S&P 500 had slipped 0.7 per cent to 1,235.86.“The market has had four good weeks on the upside, and now we have a little pause,” Mr Goldman said.Sales figures from US retail companies were mixed yesterday, with Wal-Mart saying July same-store sales rose 4.4 per cent. But the shares in the retailer slipped 0.8 per cent to $49.29.Other retailers, including the Gap, Nordstrom and Limited Brands, reported worse-than-expected sales. All three lost ground in the market, with Gap falling 1.2 per cent to $20.69 and Limited Brands down 2.7 per cent to $24.35.Nordstrom, which has gained almost 70 per cent in the past year, lost 8.2 per cent yesterday, dropping to $33.45.

Mr Ollila was CEO of Nokia for 13 years. New York shares in the company dropped 0.8 per cent to $63.49.Corporate earnings reports were set to continue in the media sector, with Viacom releasing earnings numbers later in the session.The company has struggled in trading since the beginning of the year as concerns about the future of the radio business continue to weigh down the price of the shares. Shares in Viacom were up almost 1 per cent to $34.07.Gillette, maker of personal care products, which is being acquired by Procter & Gamble, said earnings jumped 17 per cent after demand for new products increased. The stock fell 1.4 per cent to $52.20.

Shares in the food producer dropped 2.6 per cent to $20.87.In mergers and acquisitions news, HSBC Holdings agreed to buy credit card issuer Metris for $1.6 billion. Both stocks were off slightly, with HSBC down 0.8 per cent to $81.90 and Metris down 2.6 per cent to $14.46.
177;JWN;Nordstrom;2005-06-02T15:33:19Z;Luxury and youth support US store sales;;US retailers reported broadly solid sales in May, according to figures released on Thursday, with stores selling luxury items and youth fashion performing strongly, despite high fuel prices and the coolest May for some 20 years.Overall sales at stores open at least a year at 69 retailers monitored by the International Council of Shopping Centers rose by an average of 2.9 per cent, compared to 3.1 per cent in March and April.Mike Niemirah, chief economist at the ICSC, said May saw “more of a continuation of a steady and, to a degree, solid performance, curved a bit by the weather,” while noting pockets of strength in luxury, teen and men’s clothing.Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department store, reported a 7.4 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, outstriping its rival Saks Fifth Avenue, where sales grew by just 0.8 per cent. Neiman Marcus, the leading US luxury store which is being sold to private equity investors for $5.1bn, on Wednesday reported an 11 percent jump in sales.However, same-store sales at Wal-Mart’s US stores and discount warehouses rose by just 2.5 per cent, at the lower end of its forcast of 2-4 per cent growth. Wal-Mart said that food sales grew faster than sales of other goods, and that most of the increase in comparable store sales was attributable to customers spending more dollars per visit.Target, the second largest US discount store, saw a 5.1 per cent increase in same store sales. Costco, the discount warehouse club, reported a 3 per cent increase in same store sales at its US locations, and cited the impact of poor weather on sales of seasonal goods and clothing.JC Penney, the mid-range department store, posted better-than-expected May same-store sales of 3.5 per cent, above analysts’ estimates of 1.9 per cent.Youth retailer Wet Seal saw a 57 per cent increase in comparable store sales, sending its shares up around 10 per cent in New York, while Bebe and Abercrombie Fitch continued their strong performance with increases of 40.3 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Federated and Gap both missed analysts’ sales estimates, with Terry Lundgren, Federated’s CEO, saying that cool weather hurt sales of warm-weather apparel such as swimwear and sandals at the department store chain. Gap reported an 8 per cent fall in sales at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores, and suggested that continued markdowns on its summer product would continue to affect its profit margins until the introduction of new autumn lines.■ Citigroup is to buy $6.6bn in credit card debt managed by Federated and May’s department stores, in a deal that will generate cash to fund Federated’s acquisition of May’s. Citigroup is to pay an 11.5 per cent premium on the credit card receivables, or about $760m, while the deal will leave Federated with $4.5bn in cash after tax. The two have also agreed that Citigroup will operate the future credit card operations by the retailer, which owns the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s chains.
178;JWN;Nordstrom;2005-05-05T15:11:41Z;US shoppers shrug off petrol price rises;;US consumers largely brushed off the impact of higher petrol prices last month, according to retailers’ sales figures that underlined the continued strength of spending in the luxury and youth apparel and accessories sectors.“It’s a mixed bag, but overall the retailers came in ahead of expectations. It’s not blow-out, but it’s not bad,” said Gint Rimas, analyst at Thomson FirstCall, who noted that market expectations had been damped by the concerns over petrol prices and by unseasonably cool weather.“The consumer is indeed weathering the economic headwinds from high gas prices, worries over high inflation and interest rates, and even job worries,” said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. ‘The consumer continued to spend.”Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer being sold to private investors for $5.1bn, reported a 12.5 per cent increase in sales at its 37 stores, exceeding analysts expectations of a rise of about 8 per cent. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, also reported a better-than-expected 6.9 per cent increase in sales.But several department stores that cater to the middle of the market, which is more likely to be affected by energy costs, also reported better than expected sales. Federated, which own’s Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, saw its same store sales increase 2.8 per cent, against analysts’ expectations of a 0.9 per cent increase.Neiman, JC Penney and Federated increased their forecast for first quarter earnings, with Federated’s shares rising over 5 per cent in New York to $63.58.In one sign of the possible impact of higer petrol prices, Wal-Mart, the largest US discount retailer, said sales in food had been stronger than general merchandise during the month. Wal-Mart, which reported a 0.9 increase in sales, said a drop in the number of visits to its stores by customers had been offset by an increase in the value of each individual sale.Target, the rival discounter, reported a lower than expected 1.3 per cent increase in same store sales, but said it still expected “very strong profit growth” in the first quarter.A new survey of retail executive attitudes, released on Thursday by the National Retail Federation, also showed growing concern about the impact of higher interest rates and petrol prices. The NRF’s demand outlook index, which reflects business expectations for the coming six months, dropped 8.7 points in April to 52.8.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics consultancy, noted that retailers had not cited higher energy prices as a factor affecting performance during April. “If gas prices remain at these levels then it is likely to start pinching,” he said.Gap, the largest speciality apparel retailer, reported another month of disappointing sales, lowering its forcast for first quarter earnings after a five per cent fall in same store sales. Sales at Gap brand stores in North America were down 9 per cent, while sales at its international stores fell 12 per cent.Sabrina Simmons, head of investor relations, cited significantly lower margins as a result of sales to clear remaining spring merchandise.American Eagle, the youth apparel chain, continued its strong performance with a 20 per cent increase in same store sales, while rival Abercrombie & Fitch saw a 16 per cent increase.
179;JWN;Nordstrom;2004-08-20T20:55:35Z;Stocks rise as Wall Street tunes out oil;;Wall Street decided this week that it was in the business of optimism, not consistent reasoning. Tuning out the rising oil price to focus on more pleasant signals, the few traders and investors left at their desks pushed indices higher for the week.As crude oil prices appeared set to reach $50 per barrel by the week's end, equity indices advanced, breaking a pattern that has pushed them to lows for the year recently and held them near those levels.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 10,110. by Friday’s close, and 2.9 per cent higher for the five-session stretch. The broader S&P 500 index added 0.7 per cent to 1,098.35, and was 3.2 per cent higher for the week. The Nasdaq Composite put on 1 per cent to 1,838.01 by the close, for a weekly showing of 4.6 per cent to the upside.Against a backdrop of fears about the stability of Iraq's oil output and the safety of its infrastructure, crude prices established new records, with their rise further fuelled by data reflecting steadily increasing demand from both the US and China, the world's largest and second-largest consumers of oil.However, equity markets appeared to forget earlier concerns that expensive oil would become a headwind for the US economic recovery at a time when the tailwinds supporting it are either fading away or have already disappeared. Google's widely anticipated debut on the stock market provided another pleasant distraction for stock traders. After the size and price of the initial public offering were slashed, shares began trading around noon on Thursday on the Nasdaq and closed 18 per cent higher that session. By Friday morning they added a further 8 per cent.Market watchers came up with two main explanations why stocks broke the correlation with oil prices, one based on the effect of rising oil on consumers and the other concerning the nature of the rally in crude.Consumers, and traders, can afford to ignore the rising oil price for the time being because it is not crunching their spending ability, since prices at the pump have remained tame even as crude rallied.Arthur Cashin, managing director at UBS, concluded: “Without the personal hit in the pocket of higher pump prices, this round of rising crude was a bit of an intellectual exercise, a kind of economic voyeurism.”The second explanation for why stocks have shrugged off rising oil this week addresses the incremental nature of the daily rises for crude futures, which went largely unnoticed by traders.A noteworthy detail about this week's gains for stocks is that much of the advance came in the last hour of each session, after trading in commodities had ended. Furthermore, the credence of the gains is undermined by low trading volumes, as many of Wall Street's best and brightest take their summer vacation around this time of the year.In the midst of the din about crude oil, a few stocks inspired traders to place bets and hinted at pockets of growth in the economy.Home Depot shares rose 8.9 per cent for the week after reporting a 19 per cent jump in quarterly profits on Tuesday. A day earlier, rival Lowe's saw its shares add 5.3 per cent after it increased its guidance for the upcoming quarter. Shares added 7.3 per cent for the week. Increased sales at the two home improvement retailers hint at continued strength in the housing market and reflect increased spending by Americans on big-ticket projects and appliances in their homes.Elsewhere in the retail sector Staples saw its shares rise 8 per cent for the week after the office supplies retailer on Tuesday raised its full-year growth forecasts.Kmart, the discount store operator, added 15.2 per cent for the week on Monday's news it swung to profitability in the second quarter.However, Nordstrom, an upscale clothing retailer, fell 6.9 per cent for the week after it failed to meet analyst forecasts yesterday morning.In a counter-intuitive reaction to high oil prices, shares in Delta Air Lines rose 20.1 per cent on news Wednesday it was analysing restructuring plans. Continental added 15 per cent for the week in the same sector.
