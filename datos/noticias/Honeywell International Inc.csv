0;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-01-26T15:27:07Z;Companies warn of huge black market in greenhouse gas;Massive smuggling of HFCs is undermining climate goals and costing business millions;A greenhouse gas is being smuggled into the EU on a massive scale in defiance of quotas designed to limit its environmental impact, compromising the fight against climate change, leading industry figures say. The volume of black-market hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) originating in China estimated by the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency to be flooding the EU market is at least equivalent to the annual emissions of 3.5m cars. HFCs are used in air conditioning and to cool fridges and cars.“It’s like not having any regulations, or worse,” said Daniel Martínez-Valle, chief executive of Mexican company Orbia, whose Koura division produces about a fifth of the raw material used to make the refrigerant gas from a mine in Mexico. Much of the rest comes from China, which is the largest producer of HFCs. The illegal imports are costing the five big manufacturers of fluorocarbons for Europe — Orbia/Koura, Honeywell and Chemours of the US, France’s Arkema, and Japan’s Daikin — about $500m in lost profits a year, said Sameer Bharadwaj, Koura president. This undermines the companies’ ability to invest in developing greener alternatives to replace HFCs, which under EU regulations are due to be largely phased out by 2030.“We need to invest a lot in developing next-generation products that will address the global warming potential of refrigerants and reduce it by a factor of five or 10. If you can easily buy [HFCs] from China, that will limit our ability to continue investing in new products,” he said. Mr Mártinez-Valle said: “What’s the use of signing commitments, adhering to protocols and going to Davos — it’s useless if we don’t have the capacity to enforce this.”HFCs were developed to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were banned four decades ago under the Montreal Protocol after the discovery that they had caused a hole in the ozone layer. HFCs do not deplete ozone but do have global warming potential and in 2016 more than 170 countries agreed to phase them out. While production is legal, they are subject to import quotas under an ambitious EU law that established incremental cuts in the amounts of permitted HFCs from 2015.HFC prices soared in anticipation of lower supply — creating an incentive for smugglers — and were likely to rise again this year before further reductions took effect next year, said Fionnuala Walravens at the EIA. “This definitely isn’t going away,” she said.George Koutsaftes, president of Honeywell Advanced Materials which has spent close to $1bn developing new technology to replace HFCs, said it would require a forest the size of Portugal to capture all the illegal emissions. He said increasing seizures of illegally imported HFCs were encouraging, “but this won’t be fixed overnight, by a long shot . . . Things are not getting worse but they’re not getting much better”.Some HFCs are trafficked into the EU through border states Turkey, Russia and Ukraine and most end up being used in the auto after-market — for example, the servicing of cars.EU imports of the gas were not tracked in real time and customs in different member states could not see how much of a company’s import quota has been used up, said Dave Smith, business director at Koura. Furthermore, when illegal imports were found, fines were puny — as little as €5,000 in Greece, for example — compared with the opportunity to earn €200,000 with just a single shipment, he said. As a result, illicit HFCs were estimated to make up 60 per cent of the gas used in Italy, and 50-80 per cent in Greece, Bulgaria and Romania but had also been detected in France, Germany, Spain and the UK, Mr Smith said. Croatia had been found to be importing 10 times the amount of HFCs it did four years ago, he added. In a report last year, the EIA said EU customs data pointed to significant increases in some countries’ HFC imports and noted that bulk HFC imports in 2018 “were too high for compliance with the 2018 quota”. In addition, Chinese HFC export and EU import data did not tally, it said. According to EIA estimates, 117.5m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent was sold in the EU in 2018, some 16.3m metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent above permitted levels. The EU limits are “completely undermined by organised crime activities,” said Mark Vergnano, chief executive of Chemours. “We urge authorities to crack down on illegal imports of HFCs. This groundbreaking regulation was created to help address man-made climate change, but enforcement action needs to be taken or the regulation is meaningless.”The EU was trying to step up compliance efforts and Poland stood out for the strides it had made, “but the pace isn’t fast enough”, said Mr Bharadwaj. “If we solve this this year, we will be a year late,” said Mr Mártinez-Valle. 
1;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2019-07-18T16:12:36Z;Honeywell profits bolstered by strength in aerospace division;Industrial group says it is planning ‘cautiously’ given economic uncertainty;Honeywell on Thursday reported better than expected second-quarter profits driven by strength in its aerospace business and delivered a slightly rosier full-year outlook, despite what its chief executive called an “uncertain” global economy. The New Jersey-based industrial giant said organic sales — which strip out the impact of foreign exchange and the spin off of its home and transportation systems businesses — rose 5 per cent, shy of analysts’ expectations for a 6.3 per cent increase, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts.“We are continuing to plan cautiously for the second half of the year given the uncertain macro environment in which we operate,” said chief executive Darius Adamczyk.“We've seen some slowing in certain short-cycle businesses. We think it is prudent to plan conservatively in the event of a broader slowdown . . . geopolitical and the economic movements are pretty volatile right now.” The company’s shares were up close to 2 per cent by lunchtime trading in New York, when the market benchmark S&P 500 was slightly lower.Net income climbed to $1.5bn, or $2.10 a share, in the three months ended in June, compared with $1.27bn, or $1.68 a share, in the year-ago quarter. That exceeded analysts’ expected earnings of $2.08 per share.Sales in the Honeywell’s aerospace business, its largest division, rose 11 per cent on an organic basis, driven by strength in business aviation original equipment and in the US and international defence and space business.Overall net sales fell 15 per cent from the second quarter of last year, to $9.2bn. That was just shy of analysts’ estimates for $9.35bn. “We are making significant progress in transforming Honeywell into a premier software-industrial company, with connected software sales continuing to grow at a double-digit rate organically,” said Mr Adamczyk.The chief executive’s caution comes amid a slowdown in the industrial economy and uncertainty generated by the ongoing trade war between the US and China, a spat that has weighed on businesses’ spending plans.On an earnings call with analysts, Mr Adamczyk repeatedly referred to uncertainties over the short term economic environment.But the company boosted the lower end of its full-year earnings forecast and now expects between $7.95 and $8.15 a share, from $7.90 to $8.15 previously. It cited its strong first half performance and “confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareowners even in an uncertain environment”. Honeywell said the longer than expected grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, after two fatal crashes in which 346 people died, continued to have little impact on the company’s business as a supplier to Boeing.“We do not anticipate a significant impact to Honeywell's operational results in 2019,” Mr Adamczyk said. The aircraft may not return to global skies until the end of this year or possibly later. Honeywell shares are up 27 per cent year-to-date. 
2;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2019-04-18T13:30:00Z;Honeywell raises guidance on strong aviation sales;;Honeywell raised its full-year guidance as strong business aviation and defence sales helped it to produce bigger than expected rise in first-quarter earnings.The industrial conglomerate, whose products range from thermostats to jet engines, said it now expects earnings for 2019 to come in between $7.90 to $8.15 a share, up from the 7.80 to $8.10 range it gave just three months ago.Organic sales growth also got a bump up, and will now be in the 3 to 6 per cent range compared to the company’s previous forecast of 2 to 5 per cent.“We are very pleased with the start to 2019,” said Darius Adamczyk, chairman and chief executive.The upbeat guidance suggests that ongoing concerns over the outlook for global growth, US-China trade talks and the effects of Boeing’s worldwide grounding of its 737 Max aircraft have so far had little impact on Honeywell.The company also delivered another quarter of strong organic sales growth thanks to robust demand for air travel, which is boosting its all-important aerospace business.For the three months to the end of June, net sales were down 14.5 per cent at $8.88bn. However the drop was mainly due to the spin off of its home heating and security businesses last year. On an organic basis, sales were up 8 per cent — with the gauge rising across all four of its divisions during the period.Growth was once again driven by the aerospace business, which is benefiting from higher US military spending, as well as greater demand for spare parts and maintenance from the airline industry.The division, Honeywell’s largest, saw organic sales rise 10 per cent during the period. The company’s performance materials and technologies (PMT) division, which makes products used by the oil and gas sector, notched a 5 per cent rise in organic sales amid the continued rally in oil prices.Its remaining two divisions — building technology and safety and productivity solutions — delivered organic sales gains of 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.Net income attributable to Honeywell came in at $1.41bn, down from the $1.43bn reported in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the spin-offs, Honeywell earned $1.92 a share, topping analysts’ expectations for $1.83 a share.Shares in Honeywell were 1.4 per cent higher in pre-market trading on Thursday.
3;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2019-02-01T12:41:50Z;Honeywell boosted by aerospace growth;Higher business aviation and defence sales help industrials group beat analyst estimates;Strong defence and aviation sales in the final quarter of 2018 helped to boost revenue at Honeywell, the US industrial conglomerate said on Friday.The company — whose products range from thermostats to jet engines — reported aerospace sales up 10 per cent on an organic basis, driven by “double-digit” organic growth in US and international defence and business aviation.The company posted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.91, beating analyst estimates of $1.89, after overall sales grew 6 per cent on an organic basis to $9.73bn.On a reported basis, sales fell 10 per cent, after the company spun off two units last year.“We have good momentum exiting 2018 after an exciting year. We continue to transform the portfolio, as we demonstrated with the successful spin-offs of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses,” said Darius Adamczyk, Honeywell’s chairman and chief executive.“We now have a simpler, more focused portfolio spread across six attractive end markets with approximately 60 per cent of the portfolio growing sales at or above 5 per cent organically for the full year,” he added.The company said it expects sales growth of 2 to 5 per cent in 2019.
4;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-11-30T16:57:32Z;Honeywell to move headquarters to Charlotte, N Carolina;;US industrial conglomerate Honeywell on Friday said it is moving its headquarters from the Garden State for the Tar Heel state.Honeywell, which is currently headquartered in Morris Plains, New Jersey, said it expects to bring total employment in Charlotte, North Carolina, to 750 by the end of 2024. The company, whose products range from thermostats to jet engines, is also moving the headquarters of its Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS) business from Fort Mill, South Carolina, to Charlotte.About 150 to 200 New Jersey-based senior management positions and about 100 South Carolina-based positions will be relocated to Charlotte between now and September 2019. The relocation will bring its headquarters closer to several of the company’s businesses in the Southeast.North Carolina has offered Honeywell $46m in incentives based on employment each year.“Our decision does not reflect any issues with the quality of our experience in New Jersey,” Darius Adamczyk, chief executive, said.He added: “Charlotte is a top-10 destination city in the US that will readily enable us to recruit and retain the world-class talent we will need over the long term to support Honeywell’s strategic focus on leading technology and software solutions within our end markets.”Honeywell said about 1,000 employees will remain in New Jersey, including about 800 employees at Morris Plains, its current headquarters.The company, which recently completed spin-offs of its home and transportation units, has seen its business buoyed by higher crude prices and global demand for air travel.Honeywell shares, which are down 0.7 per cent year-to-date, were little changed at pixel time.
5;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-10-19T11:46:09Z;Oil prices and air travel help Honeywell continue winning streak;;Honeywell continued its winning streak during the third quarter as higher oil prices and strong global demand for air travel helped spur demand for its services and propel earnings above analysts estimates.Shares in the industrial conglomerate, which makes everything from jet engines to products used in crude oil refining, rose 3.2 per cent in pre-market trading as the company also issued new guidance to reflect the spin-offs of its home and transportation businesses.For the three months to end of September, net sales at Honeywell rose 6.3 per cent to $10.76bn, topping the $10.75bn that Wall Street was expecting. Like-for-like sales were up 7 per cent — with the gauge rising across all four of its divisions during the period.Growth was once again driven by the aerospace business, which is benefiting from higher US military spending, as well as greater demand for spare parts and maintenance from the airline industry.The division, Honeywell’s largest, saw revenue rise 10 per cent to $4.03bn during the period. The company’s performance materials and technologies division, which makes products used by the oil and gas sector, also turned in a solid quarter. Sales rose 3 per cent to $2.64bn thanks to the sharp rally in oil prices that briefly pushed Brent crude to fresh four-year highs this month.Its remaining two divisions — home and building technology and safety and productivity solutions — notched up sales gains of 2 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.Net income attributable to Honeywell came in at $2.33bn, up from the $1.34bn reported in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.03, ahead of the $1.99 a share the market had forecast.The company also issued new full-year guidance to take into account the dilution from the spin-off of its transportation system business Garrett Motion and Resideo Technologies, its connected home technology business.Honeywell now expects to earn between $7.95 and $8 a share, compared to its previous range of $8.05 to $8.15 a share. Sales are now projected to be between $41.7bn and $41.8bn, down from its previous guidance of $43.1bn to $43.6bn. Organic sales growth is seen at 6 per cent, compared with its prior guidance of between 5 and 6 per cent.
6;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-09-04T04:02:43Z;Passenger growth drives efficiency efforts by airline operators;Despite progress, more must be done to reduce greenhouse emissions of modern aircraft;The aviation industry is one of the most visible contributors to climate change. Anyone looking up at a blue sky after a plane has flown by will see its white trail — water vapour mixed with carbon dioxide, sulphur and nitrogen oxides and metal particles, all those things scientists worry about.The industry wants to capitalise on global growth — passenger capacity has grown by 5-8 per cent each year since 2013. But it also needs to pull its weight on the world’s environmental agenda. Luckily for aviation, its interest in using less fuel to save money coincides with that of environmentalists, driving innovation to please both.Flight is not the most damaging mode of transport for greenhouse gas emissions. The UN’s International Panel on Climate Change has estimated that civil aviation accounts for 2 per cent of all global man-made carbon dioxide emissions, far behind that created by road transport.In its 2017 update on the transport sector, the International Energy Agency welcomed recent annual average fuel efficiency improvements of 3.7 per cent in the aviation sector.But the body noted that “with few alternatives to fossil fuels, aircraft efficiency needs to continue to improve at a rapid rate”. It also added that more substitution of biofuels for fossil fuels would be needed to help prevent a catastrophic increase in world temperatures of 2 degrees in the coming decades.Reducing the weight of aircraft — every part of it — is an obvious place for engine-makers such as Rolls-Royce and GE and aerospace manufacturers including Boeing and Airbus to start.In the engine itself, carbon fibre composite materials make fan blades and the fan case much lighter, and 3D printing of parts has proved promising too. Composite materials also allow slimmer seats — which means more seats and more passengers. Aluminium wire could replace traditional copper used in construction, saving up to 60 per cent of the 1,200kg of cabling on a single-aisle jet. Even the windows are up for grabs if they are scrapped and replaced by displays of soothing scenes.Bob Lange, a senior vice-president at European aerospace manufacturer Airbus, says: “When you’re trying to lift things, weight is the enemy.”Sean Newsum, director of environmental strategy at Boeing, says the airline industry knows how to get the best out of its aircraft, including by increasing occupancy, which has risen from 74 per cent in 2003 to 82 per cent in 2017. But technical design matters especially: “Each generation of aeroplanes we’ve developed has been 15-20 per cent [more fuel efficient] than the prior generation.”This is why airlines buy new planes, says József Váradi, chief executive of Hungary’s low-cost Wizz Air, which has the youngest fleet of any European carrier. He adds that Wizz has “around 30 different fuel[-saving] initiatives”, such as using only one engine when a plane is taxiing.Pilot behaviour can be as important as engineering innovation and flight data. Airbus’s Mr Lange says his company’s software records 300,000 types of data during a flight, which can then be used to make a pilot more fuel-efficient. One example: “We can monitor flight operations and determine at what point in the descent the landing gear go down. If they’re being put down too early, then the aircraft is burning more fuel than it needs to.” This is fed back to airlines, which can change pilots’ procedures.Honeywell, a US engineering conglomerate, has created GoDirect Flight Efficiency analytics software which can draw in millions of data points during a flight to work out when fuel is being used inefficiently.Julie Vasquez of Honeywell says airlines sometimes tell their pilots to “throttle it” to arrive at an airport as quickly as possible, which is operationally sensible “but it’s actually not necessary if they’re able to achieve efficiency, to drill down on where they’re having challenges with on-time performance”.There are, of course, environmental campaigners who think the aviation industry’s current model and keen growth are inherently inimical to any kind of energy reduction. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, says: “The core problem for aviation is that it is currently fossil-fuel intensive and there’s no real alternative technology.” His hope is that electric planes will at some point arrive, but these are many years off.And he is sceptical even of current mitigation attempts: “A lot of the industry’s efforts are greenwash, making a lot of noise about peripheral issues while their overall emissions increase.” He refers to the International Civil Aviation Organization’s offsetting scheme, which has global support but is only voluntary until 2027. “Aviation is decades behind other industries in its response to climate change,” he says.
7;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-07-26T04:00:47Z;Cost impact of tariffs laid bare in corporate earnings;From toys to tools and trucks, manufacturers tweak supply chains and plan price rises;Donald Trump’s multi-front trade battles are prompting warnings from some of the largest US companies that higher tariffs will squeeze their profit margins, force them to pass on the pain to suppliers and push prices up for consumers.An analysis of executives’ comments since the start of the second quarter reporting season shows that most US companies see little immediate impact from the trade actions announced by the Trump administration, most of which have yet to take effect, but makers of toys, tools and trucks have begun to take steps to respond.“This is a very dynamic situation that changes by the day . . . and we’re giving it substantial focus,” Honeywell chairman and chief executive Greg Lewis told analysts. With inflation accelerating in transportation, logistics and metals, the industrial conglomerate was adjusting its pricing “as necessary”, he said, and had begun evaluating “more structural solutions” to weather the tariffs over the longer term, including finding new suppliers.“I think it’s going to be one of those things that goes through into consumer pricing,” cautioned James Quincey, chief executive of Coca-Cola, after the soft drinks group increased prices in response to increases in an array of costs, from freight to the metal used in Coke cans.Whirlpool also told investors it had raised its pricing in response to the “significant headwind” of steel and aluminium tariffs pushing up the cost of raw materials for its washing machines, and companies from Danaher to United Technologies said they were eyeing similar price increases.Stanley Black & Decker said higher prices had so far helped the tool maker fend off the effect of tariffs and unfavourable currency movements, but executives said they may still have to make changes to its supply chain should higher tariffs stay in place for the long term.Companies from 3M to General Electric expressed confidence in their ability to change their sourcing if needed, citing their diversified global supply chains. “Sometimes the hardest part is figuring out what the rules are. But once it’s communicated, we can adapt pretty quickly,” said Scott Roe, chief financial officer of VF, the owner of clothing brands from Vans to The North Face.A few companies have spelt out the tariffs’ likely toll: the White House’s trade measures will cost Ford an estimated $500m-$600m this year, would cost GE $300m-$400m if it had taken no mitigating steps and are forecast to add $45m-$55m to Harley-Davidson’s 2018 costs, executives said.Harley, which last month drew fire from Mr Trump by shifting some production from the US after the EU targeted it in retaliation for US steel and aluminium tariffs, said it planned to keep the prices of its motorbikes unchanged. But that will put pressure on operating profit margins this year, for which it shaved its guidance by half a percentage point, to 9-10 per cent.The warnings come against the backdrop of an unusually strong earnings season for corporate America, despite other challenges including labour shortages, higher transportation costs and currency swings.Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S projects earnings growth of 21.4 for the second quarter, and said on Wednesday that of the nearly 150 S&P 500 companies to have reported so far, 86 per cent had exceeded Wall Street’s expectations — a record since it began collecting the data in 1994.The executives’ comments also represent a striking change of tone from three months ago, when attention focused on calculating the benefits to companies’ bottom lines of the corporate tax cuts Congress passed at the end of 2017.CEOs broadly welcomed the Trump administration’s agenda of cutting taxes and rolling back regulations, but growing fears of a trade war have prompted some to speak up for the principle of free trade in the hope of changing its protectionist trade policy.“We are a company that’s built for fair and open trade,” said John Flannery, chief executive of GE.Brian Goldner, chief executive of Hasbro, put the message more starkly. The toy maker was already moving some production from China to the US, he said, but it was talking to the administration and members of Congress to communicate “just how terrible an impact an ongoing tariff or trade war would be”.
8;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-07-20T11:17:28Z;Honeywell shrugs off trade war fears with third earnings upgrade;;"What trade jitters?

US industrial conglomerate Honeywell raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance for the third time this year, as strong growth across all segment of its businesses eclipsed uncertainties around US trade policies.The company, whose products range from thermostats to jet engines, now expects earnings for 2018 to come it at between $8.05 to $8.15 per share, up from the already upgraded guidance of $7.85-$8.05 it gave in April. Organic sales growth also got a bump and will now be in the 5 to 6 per cent range compared to the 3-5 per cent increase the company had previously forecast.The results, among the earliest in a wave of US industrial earnings about to hit Wall Street, showed that there was no negative impact thus far on Honeywell from President Donald Trump’s trade war with the rest of the world.Indeed, the upgraded guidance comes as the company delivered another quarter of blowout sales growth thanks to robust demand for air travel which is boosting its all-important aerospace business.For the three months to the end of June, net sales at Honeywell rose 8.3 per cent to $10.9bn, topping the $10.8bn that Wall Street was expecting. Like-for-like sales were up 6 per cent — with the gauge rising across all four of its divisions during the period.Growth was once again driven by the aerospace business, which is benefiting from higher US military spending, as well as greater demand for spare parts and maintenance from the airline industry.The division, Honeywell’s largest, saw revenue rise 10 per cent to $4.05bn during the period. The company’s performance materials and technologies (PMT) division, which makes products used by the oil and gas sector, also turned in a solid quarter. Sales rose 5 per cent to $2.69bn thanks to the recent rally in oil prices.Its remaining two divisions — home and building technology and safety and productivity solutions — notched up sales gains of 5 per cent and 13 per cent respectively.Net income attributable to Honeywell came in at $1.27bn, down from the $1.39bn reported in the prior year period. The drop was mainly due to one off costs related to the spin off of its home heating and security business, announced in October. Excluding these items, Honeywell earned $2.12 a share, topping analysts' expectations for $2.01 a share.Shares in Honeywell, down 3.8 per cent since the start of the year, were up 1 per cent in pre-market trading on Friday."
9;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-06-18T03:03:15Z;US business leaders warn on impact of Trump tariffs;Previously upbeat mood in boardrooms chills as president raises the stakes with China;Donald Trump’s new tariffs on $50bn of Chinese imports have run into stiff opposition from US business leaders, a change in mood for boardrooms that had welcomed the president’s cuts to taxes and regulations and had largely shrugged off his protectionist rhetoric. The US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, two of Washington’s largest lobbying groups, both warned on Friday that the tariffs and resulting retaliation from China would harm US manufacturers, farmers and consumers. “This is not the right approach,” said Tom Donohue, Chamber of Commerce president.“Risking a potential trade war is the wrong way to fix these problems,” the roundtable warned, even as it said it shared the administration’s concerns about China’s “discriminatory trade practices”.The reaction comes after a sustained period of rising confidence among small and large US businesses, which has been boosted by Mr Trump’s deregulatory agenda and, in particular, by the cuts to corporate tax rates in the Republican legislation he signed into law last December.Surveys suggest that trend has turned as talk of trade wars has grown louder. Morgan Stanley’s business conditions index fell from 65 in May to 63 in June, and the Business Roundtable’s economic outlook survey recorded its first decline in nearly two years in the second quarter, falling to 111.1 from 118.6 three months earlier. The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants reported last week that 38 per cent of the executives it polled were concerned about potential conflicts between the US and its trading partners, with 40 per cent saying US tariffs or retaliatory measures would hurt their businesses. Strong corporate earnings and confidence about the US economy have further boosted directors’ optimism after the tax reforms that yielded windfalls for many companies. But Gary Cohn, one of the most prominent business voices in the administration until he stepped down as head of the National Economic Council in April, said last week that a trade war could wipe out the boost that business had gained from tax reforms.The growing uncertainty and concern about trade policy has made tariffs a flashpoint in the relationship between Washington and a business community that had largely discounted Mr Trump’s protectionist speeches on the subject since he started campaigning for the presidency in 2015. “That’s what’s so frightening. The rhetoric for the first time has reached a level where it is real,” said Peter Quinter, chair of the customs law committee of the American Bar Association, whose clients include Chinese exporters to US importers in sectors from food to electronic equipment. “I’ve been doing international trade law 30 years and I’ve never seen anything this potentially dangerous to what I call the rule of law,” he said. “A trade spat? That happens but a trade war between the two greatest economic powers in the history of the United States is very dangerous.”John Bozzella, president and chief executive of the Association of Global Automakers, which represents international car companies and suppliers in the US, said Mr Trump had raised legitimate concerns about China, “but no one wins in a trade war”. Mr Trump’s earlier announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has split opinion in corporate America. Most domestic metals producers welcomed the move, with David Burritt, chief executive of US Steel, telling CNBC last week it would allow the company to create 800 jobs at a plant in Illinois after 30 years of having “sand kicked in our faces” by other countries. Other chief executives, particularly manufacturers who use imported steel and aluminium, have warned that the tariffs would leave businesses wary of investing and force them to pass rising costs on to consumers. Michael Lamach, chairman and chief executive of Ingersoll-Rand, a manufacturer of golf carts and air conditioners, told a UBS conference last week that customers were asking “what the rules of the game are going forward. I think what you need is certainty around the rules.”.

Third Point and Goldman Sachs have each launched their first “special purpose acquisition vehicles” (spacs), with heavyweight leaders: respectively Tom Farley, former president of the New York Stock Exchange, and David Cote, ex-boss of Honeywell.Whether these vehicles deserve rehabilitation depends on the structure and treatment of sponsors, investors, and target companies. In every spac, investors are in the dark about what might be acquired — hence their “blank cheque” sobriquet. Just like the (possibly apocryphal) 18th century prospectus that sought funding “for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is”. Except, not quite. The spac has to return money if it fails to find a willing target within two years.The attraction to the sponsor is obvious. They typically buy 20 per cent of the shares of the spac for a nominal amount. It resembles the private equity model, without the tedious business of tapping big pension funds and endowments.This leaves the target’s incentive. One attraction is an easy route to going public. This is the brunt of the pitch from a spac launched last year by Social Capital, which offered to take a minority investment in a tech unicorn. Eight months in, Social Capital has not found a willing target. It is an expensive form of capital to avoid a roadshow.There is devil is in the detail of fundraising too. If a spac raises $400m and pays $400m for a company, sponsors end up with a fifth. But if it raises additional equity and uses leverage, that might be diluted.The model works best when it sticks closer to a private equity template: buy, change the management and improve the business. Mr Cote will run an acquired industrial company. Mr Farley a financial technology business. Their elbow grease is needed to make the spacs shine.
12;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-04-20T11:20:25Z;Honeywell boosts guidance on strong airline and military demand;;Strong growth in its all-important aerospace business, along with continued demand for its home and building technologies helped Honeywell deliver another quarter of forecast-busting results.The industrial conglomerate, whose products range from thermostats to jet engines, also raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance for a second time this year, despite the uncertainties surrounding US-China trade relations.For the three months ending in March, net sales rose 9.4 per cent to $10.39bn, easily cruising past the $10bn that Wall Street was expecting. Within this, like-for-like sales were up 4 per cent — with the gauge gaining across all four of its divisions during the period.Growth was driven by its aerospace business, which is benefitting from higher US military spending, as well as higher demand for spare parts and maintenance from the airline industry thanks to robust demand for air travel.The division, Honeywell’s largest, saw revenue grow 12 per cent to $3.97bn during the period. The company’s performance materials and technologies (PMT) division, which makes things used by the oil and gas sector, also had a stellar quarter. Sales rose 8 per cent to $2.5bn thanks to the recent rally in oil prices.Its remaining two divisions — home and building technology and safety and productivity solutions — notched up sales gains of 7 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.Overall net income attributable to Honeywell came in at $1.438bn, an 8 per cent rise from the prior year period and largely in line with expectations.Looking ahead, Honeywell said it now expects earnings per share for this year to come in at between $7.85-$8.05 a share, up from its previous forecast $7.75 to $8.00 and its original guidance of $7.55 to $7.80.It also raised its outlook on sales to between $42.7bn-$43.5bn from $41.8bn-$42.5bn. Within this, organic growth is forecast to be between 3-5 per cent, compared to the 2-4 per cent increase it was predicting just three months ago.“Honeywell had a very strong start to 2018, with first-quarter results that were driven by exceptional sales and operational performance,” said chief executive Darius Adamczyk.Honeywell shares were largely unchanged at $148.13.
13;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-02-26T19:55:39Z;Honeywell names chair of home heating and security business spin-off;;US industrial conglomerate Honeywell on Monday put forward the first board appointment for the home heating and security business spin-off that it announced in October.Honeywell said it will name Roger Fradin, a former long-time company executive at Honeywell who retired from the company in February last year, the chairman of the board for the Homes and Global Distribution business spin-off.Mr Fradin will start immediately to begin the transition into a standalone business.“Roger’s experience, passion, technical knowledge, unwavering focus on serving customers, and ability to attract and motivate a highly talented workforce will ensure the Homes spin-off thrives as an independent company,” Darius Adamczyk, chief executive, said.Last year, Honeywell announced plans to spin off its turbo charger unit — a roughly $3bn business — and its home heating and security units — a roughly $4.5bn business — to create two new publicly listed companies in response to pressure from activist investor Third Point.The spin-offs are expected to be completed by the end of the year and the search is currently under way for a chief executive.Separately, Honeywell on Monday said its forecasts 4,000 to 4,200 new civilian-use helicopters will be delivered from this year to 2022.“In addition to better global economic conditions expected in the coming years, potential positive impacts of US tax reform on new helicopter demand and lower volatility in oil and gas-related markets have helped fleet managers confirm what they told us last year,” said Ben Driggs, president, Americas, Honeywell Aerospace.Honeywell shares were up 0.7 per cent to $156.23.
14;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-01-30T05:00:39Z;Lex in Depth: the case against share buybacks;With investment in development stuck at pre-crisis levels and stock prices high, do US companies’ huge repurchases make sense?;S&P 500 companies have spent $1.1tn on share repurchase programmes over the past two years, as executives struggled to turn modest economic growth into higher earnings. Lacking opportunities to invest, or at least shareholder support to do so, companies have spent money buying their own stock, which provides a boost to the size of profits reported per share.Fresh records for buybacks are likely to be set, with changes to the US tax regime expected to trigger a repatriation of profits that have been held offshore for years.A string of companies, including Boeing and Honeywell, have announced close to $90bn worth of share buyback programmes since the reforms were agreed in December. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that of $1.2tn parked overseas, perhaps half of the post-tax total, or around $450bn, could be devoted to share buybacks.“Shareholders are going to be banging on doors saying we want some of that money,” says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones. No matter that stock markets have set record highs of late, the expectation that spare cash must be returned to its rightful owners is putting managers under pressure.“They almost have to buy when the stock is high. Timing the market is not something most companies can do,” adds Mr Silverblatt. But the new flood of dollars raises an old question about whose interest the practice serves.Companies justify buybacks in terms of discipline and confidence. But, almost nine years into a stock market boom, executives are planning to buy shares when long-term valuations have rarely been higher. The latest surge comes as many companies have already piled up cheap debt simply to fund payouts to shareholders.Meanwhile, the proportion of sales spent on research and development at S&P500 companies is still yet to recover to pre-2008 levels. William Lazonick, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Lowell, is a critic of what he calls “profits without prosperity”. Blaming the financialisation of business, he sees in the mantra of shareholder returns the neglect of investment over short-term profits.“The only benefit of share buybacks is to people who are in the business of selling shares: executives,” he says.Do buybacks undermine the financial health of companies, juice bonuses and threaten the real economy? Lex examines the charge sheet.Companies are run on behalf of a diverse range of investors often with competing interests. Calls for buybacks can sometimes be seen as a response to a lack of trust from some investors that managers will spend the cash wisely.“The positive view mostly comes from a period when many companies were sitting on too much cash, and investors intended [the buyback] as a way to impose discipline,” says Fabrizio Ferri, associate professor at the Columbia Business School.Corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn, who rose to fame in the 1980s by breaking up flabby conglomerates for profit, evolved into activist investors preaching a mantra of shareholder returns.Today, the announcement of a buyback can be a signal that shares are cheap, or a response to discontent with profits or strategy. Before General Electric announced a cut in its dividend last year, for only the second time since the depression, the manufacturing conglomerate was part way through a $50bn programme of repurchases announced while under pressure from the activist investor Nelson Peltz.For many companies, particularly those in the technology sector, routine buybacks are a consequence of rising share prices. “The connection between stock compensation for employees and buybacks is very real,” says David Zion, founder of Zion Research. Staff sell stock awards, forcing companies to buy to keep the share count stable. Apple has admitted that a primary purpose of its buybacks is to neutralise the impact of stock compensation.The company has spent $151bn on repurchasing stock in the past decade, about 17 per cent of its almost $900bn market valuation. The number of shares has dropped by about the same amount — 17 per cent. Yet when Apple started to buy in 2012, the shares could be bought for half today’s price. The difference has been handed to employees.Verdict GuiltyUnlike a dividend paid at regular intervals, executives usually have authority to buy back stock at their own discretion. For most of the last century boards were reluctant to grant it because a company that dipped into the market to buy its own stock would arouse suspicion of market manipulation.In 1982, however, the US Securities and Exchange Commission outlined a legal “safe harbour” for buybacks. Their popularity soared in the 1990s, as companies began rewarding executives with stock options. The value of such grants is tied to the share price, with dividend payments doing little or nothing for a chief executive’s remuneration.In 1998 the value of buybacks by S&P 500 members topped that of dividends for the first time. The pattern has been repeated in 13 of the past 14 years.Purchases can be used to shrink the number of shares in issue when earnings per share needs a boost, or to support the price when employees are exercising options to sell stock. Little disclosure about the precise timing of buybacks is required, and the area is not one where the SEC, which polices accounting issues, has typically taken action.But the manipulation charge tends to fall flat because investors can see what is spent each quarter, and track movements in the number of shares in issue. They also tend to have an interest in a higher share price, and reward companies whose profits are predictable.For instance, between 2005 and 2007 GE was one of the largest acquirers of its own stock, spending $32bn. When the financial crisis hit in 2008, the company was forced to raise $15bn from investors, leading to criticism that the repurchases were not the best use of capital. Yet shareholders had cheered the activity at the time.Equilar, which benchmarks corporate compensation, says that just over half of US listed companies use a total shareholder return metric, which adds dividends to share price gains, when setting executive pay.Only about a third of boards use EPS to determine pay awards. “Companies realise that buybacks have an effect on EPS,” says Dan Marcec of Equilar. “When a company buys back shares at the same time it is using EPS as a performance metric, it will almost always have a way of adjusting for that effect”.Verdict Not guilty. Blame the investors, board and disclosure rules if some managers manipulate EPS.The only year in the past 14 when big US companies spent less on buybacks than dividends was 2009, when the S&P 500 index hit rock bottom. “The best time to do [a buyback] is in a recession, but that’s when everyone is scared stupid,” says Andrew Lapthorne, a quantitative strategist for Société Générale.If a company has more cash than it needs, and nothing better to invest in, it should consider whether buying its own stock is a good investment. Yet the time when companies have plenty of spare cash tends to be when business is good and shares are overvalued.Many companies bought back shares before money became tight. Commodity trader Glencore announced a $1bn buyback in 2014, but a year later it cancelled the dividend and raised equity as it scrambled to cut debt after commodity prices crashed.But it is hard for executives to hold on to cash in anticipation of a distant downturn, or to argue that their shares are overpriced. Few companies are ever explicit about the thinking or calculation that determines when it makes sense to repurchase.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is an exception. The conglomerate of insurers and industrial companies does not pay a dividend, and rarely repurchases shares. Mr Buffett has said he will buy them only when the stock is undervalued, defined as less than 1.2 times the stated book value of its assets, something that has not occurred in years.Verdict GuiltySome companies have managed to spend more on buybacks in recent years than the shares are worth today.Since 1995 IBM, the consulting and supercomputer group, has spent $162bn to repurchase more than half of its outstanding shares. What is left, for those who did not sell, is a company now valued at $154bn, suggesting the money was spent in the wrong place.Any company will wonder what its valuation might have been, were different decisions taken. Prof Lazonick points to the example of Cisco Systems, the world’s largest networking company. In two decades it has spent $75bn repurchasing stock, more than three times the total for capital investment in property or equipment. A serial acquirer of other businesses, it has long struggled to grow sales.Prof Lazonick suggests a dramatic alternative reality for the company, pointing to an employee-owned business that has taken much of the market for the infrastructure underpinning mobile phone networks. He says: “There’s the company that Cisco should have been, or could have been, and it’s the Chinese company, Huawei”.Verdict The jury is out.Three of the most dangerous words in the English language are “debt is cheap”. Low interest rates have encouraged corporate borrowing to buy back stock and boost earnings per share. “Traditionalists would say equity is expensive and not tax efficient. Debt is cheap and tax-deductible. The problem with that argument is it completely misunderstands credit risk,” says Mr Lapthorne.The beauty of equity as a source of capital for business is that as it is perpetual, it does not need to be repaid. In a credit crunch or downturn, dividends can be cut to save cash, fresh equity sold.Yet the popularity of buybacks has changed the cycle, for listed companies at least. Before the 2008 financial crisis, measures of indebtedness, or so-called leverage, fell. Overall debt levels were rising, but asset values were also much inflated. For non-financial companies in the S&P 1500, net debt as a proportion of assets dropped from 21 per cent in 2000, to below 9 per cent five years later. This time the metric has steadily risen along with the market, to exceed 19 per cent.Last April the International Monetary Fund calculated that $7.8tn had been added to the liabilities of US companies since 2010. Median net debt of S&P 500 companies was close to a record high of 1.5 times earnings. Contemplating Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates, the IMF last year warned that businesses representing a fifth of corporate assets could struggle to meet higher interest costs.Verdict Guilty as hell.Guilty on three out of five charges, executives who propose to spend money on expensive shares will be condemned to the enduring suspicion of shareholders. Early parole will be granted for good behaviour, including clear articulation of how a company approaches the decision to buy its own stock, and for investment in the real economy.Additional reporting by Tom Braithwaite in San FranciscoBuybacks and corporate governance are linked / From George Dallas, London, UKBuybacks are not guilty of all the FT’s charges / From Théo Vermaelen, Fontainebleau, France
15;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-01-29T11:15:25Z;GE is a rare loser from US tax reform;Company with ‘the Harvard of tax departments’ admits it will have to pay more;While many US companies are working out how to spend the windfalls they expect from the tax reform passed at the end of last year, General Electric is facing the opposite prospect: it is expecting a rising tax rate over the next few years.Reporting earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 last week, GE forecast its percentage tax rate to be in the mid to high teens this year and next, and in the low to mid-20s in the long term. That compares with a tax rate of 14 per cent in 2015 and 9 per cent in 2016 for the industrial operations that are the continuing core of the company now it has shed most of its financial services businesses.GE’s tax department, employing hundreds of accountants and lawyers, has long been acknowledged as one of the most effective in US business, for years keeping the group’s tax charges well below the main corporate rate of 35 per cent. Other companies have sought to emulate its success.But the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 22, is expected to wipe out much of the advantage that GE has enjoyed.The rising tax rate represents another headwind for John Flannery, the new chief executive who took over last August, as he attempts to turn round the troubled industrial group.Businesses are still working through the full implications of the tax changes, but it already seems likely that GE will be worse off. That outlook contrasts with the position for other US manufacturers such as Honeywell, which on Friday revised up its projected earnings for 2018 because it expected a lower tax rate.The reform package cut the main rate of US corporate tax to 21 per cent, but also put limits on international companies’ ability to make use of credits and losses. A new minimum tax on “global intangible low-taxed income”, levied on the earnings of the foreign subsidiaries of US groups, will make it harder to reduce charges by shifting profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. Another new measure, the “base erosion anti-abuse tax”, limits companies’ ability to take advantage of tax credits.Jamie Miller, GE’s chief financial officer, told analysts on a call last week that the company’s effective tax rate was expected to rise because it would be less able to use credits and losses to cut its payments.The company took a charge of $3.5bn for the fourth quarter as a result of the US tax overhaul, including $2.2bn for the reduced value of credits and losses, and $1.2bn for a new tax charged on past foreign earnings.GE conducted a radical shake-up of its tax planning unit, sometimes referred to as “the Harvard of tax departments”, just last year. In April, 600 of the group’s tax professionals moved to PwC, the accountancy and consulting group, where they will continue to work for GE, but also for other companies.Mike Gosk, GE’s senior tax counsel, said at the time that other clients of PwC would have the opportunity to “tap into the world’s best tax team”.GE’s group tax rate has been low thanks in part to accumulated losses in GE Capital, the financial services division, following the crisis of 2007-09, but it was paying less than the 35 per cent headline rate for years before then.Jeff Immelt, the previous chief executive, acknowledged in 2016 after Mr Trump was elected that tax reform could have adverse consequences for GE, but said he saw opportunities in the proposals put forward by Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the ways and means committee in the House of Representatives. Mr Brady’s plan would have helped companies such as GE that export from the US, but it was abandoned by Republicans last summer after opposition from retailers.Ms Miller said last week that in spite of the adverse direct impact of the tax overhaul on GE, the group still saw it overall as “a real positive for US companies”.She added that she did not expect GE to be repatriating a large amount of cash to the US as a result of the tax reform, because the group’s foreign earnings were mostly reinvested into its businesses overseas.GE is not the only US company that expects to pay a higher tax rate under the new system. IBM reported a 12 per cent tax rate for last year, excluding one-off items, and said it expected to pay 14-18 per cent on the same basis this year.Eaton, the electrical products manufacturing group that relocated its headquarters to Ireland after buying Cooper Industries in an “inversion” deal in 2012, has also said it expects to face a higher tax rate.
16;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-01-26T15:29:30Z;Honeywell to use part of $7bn repatriated cash for acquisitions;;Honeywell, the US industrial conglomerate, plans to repatriate $7bn of overseas earnings due to US tax reform and will use it for acquisitions, share repurchases and to increase company contributions to US employee pension funds.Honeywell chief financial officer Tom Szlosek told analysts on a Friday earnings call that the $7bn in overseas cash would be brought back to the US over the next two years.“This new global mobility of our cash will allow us to…more aggressively seek out M&A. Our preference is for attractive bolt-on acquisitions in our core markets but to the extent that M&A opportunities do not materialise we will gradually accelerate share repurchases”, he said as the company announced fourth quarter earnings.The company also plans to use the benefits of tax reform to increase 401k pension contributions for employees in the US.An expected reduction in the company’s effective US tax rate, which will fall to 22 to 23 cents from 25 to 26 per cents previously, allowed Honeywell to raise its 2018 earnings per share forecast to between $7.75 to $8.00, up from its previous forecast of $7.55 to $7.80. Honeywell also said it sees greater bullishness from its customers because of tax reform which could boost investment on their part, and sales for the industrial conglomerate.But tax reform was not all good news for Honeywell which also took a $3.8bn charge in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 due to tax reform, which included charges on repatriating earnings of non-US subsidiaries and writing down the value of deferred tax liabilities, the company said.The bump in guidance came as Honeywell delivered better than expected fourth quarter results. For the three months to the end of December, net sales rose 8.5 per cent to $10.8bn, topping analysts’ estimates for $10.77bn. The growth was driven by its aerospace business, which is benefitting from higher demand for spare parts and services such as maintenance from the airline industry thanks to robust demand for air travel.
17;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-01-26T12:19:54Z;Honeywell lifts profit outlook on tax reform boost;;US industrial conglomerate Honeywell raised its 2018 earnings outlook on Friday, saying it expects to benefit from a lower effective tax rate in the wake of the recently enacted tax reforms.The company, which makes products ranging from thermostats to jet engines, said it now expects earnings per share for this year to come in at between $7.75 to $8.00, up from its previous forecast of $7.55 to $7.80.Shares in Honeywell, which hit a record high of $161.89 on Thursday, edged 0.2 per cent lower in pre-market trading.The bump up in guidance comes as Honeywell delivered better than expected fourth quarter results.For the three months to the end of December, net sales rose 8.5 per cent to $10.8bn, topping analysts’ estimates for $10.77bn. The growth was driven by its aerospace business, which is benefitting from higher demand for spare parts and services such as maintenance from the airline industry thanks to robust demand for air travel.The division, Honeywell’s largest, saw revenue grow by more than 6 per cent to $3.9bn during the period. The company’s performance materials and technologies (PMT) division, which makes things used by the oil and gas sector, also had a stellar quarter. Sales rose 12.4 per cent to $2.8bn thanks to the continued rebound in oil prices.Its remaining two divisions: home and building technology and safety and productivity solutions notched up sales gains of 5.1 per cent and 14 per cent respectively.Last October the company said it would pare its focus to four business lines, including aerospace, and spin off its turbo charger unit and home heating and security businesses in response to pressure from activist investor Third Point.Adjusted net income - which excludes the spin off expenses and a $3.8bn charge related to taxes incurred on deferred tax liabilities and the repatriation of non-US earnings - came in at $1.42bn, or $1.85 per share, a hair ahead of the $1.84 a share the market had forecast.Including the charges, the company fell into a loss of $2.4bn, compared to a profit of $1.04bn reported in the prior year period.Chief executive Darius Adamczyk said:Honeywell’s transformation to a software-industrial leader is well underway, and in 2018, we expect to complete the spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business, and our Transportation Systems business, which will position Honeywell for future growth and margin expansion.After the spins, these businesses will be better positioned to maximize shareowner value through focused strategic decision making and capital allocation tailored for their end markets.
18;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2018-01-20T13:52:04Z;Melrose’s GKN swoop has the hallmarks of an old-school raid;Bid revives the spirit of the takeover tactics used by an earlier corporate buccaneer;For the past three decades, Christopher Miller has been honing the takeover tactics he learnt at the feet of the UK’s most famous corporate raider, the late James Hanson.A leaf from that playbook was on display this week as Melrose Industries, the London-listed investment vehicle Mr Miller chairs, pressed ahead with the largest hostile UK bid since Kraft Foods swooped for chocolate maker Cadbury in 2009.By offering £7.4bn for GKN, the British automotive and aerospace supplier that has fallen out of favour with shareholders, Melrose kicked off a battle that prompted GKN to accuse it of deceiving investors with “inaccurate” and “fake” claims.It also triggered a sense of nostalgia among City of London veterans for a bygone era of buccaneering raids, when the likes of Lord Hanson assembled conglomerates by pouncing on straggling companies with weak managements.“This bid is a throwback,” says Richard Buxton, chief executive of Old Mutual Global Investors, who has followed Mr Miller’s rise since he left Lord Hanson’s side in 1988 to set out on his own. “It feels a bit like we are back in the 1980s.”Melrose’s pursuit of GKN, a FTSE 100 listed engineering brand with a 259-year heritage, represents its biggest acquisition attempt by market value and by sales.Yet it features hallmarks of an old-school raid.Melrose put its offer formally to shareholders on Wednesday, despite having had the bid knocked down just days earlier by GKN’s directors for being “entirely opportunistic” and “fundamentally undervaluing” the company.Such a move is rare in modern UK takeover battles. Bidders typically gauge investor sentiment, adjust their offers over time and launch formally once when they have secured the support of the target’s board.And unlike most hostile bids, the offer to GKN shareholders is only about 20 per cent in cash with the remainder comprised of Melrose shares, implying that GKN is poorly run and would be better managed by its suitor. GKN has scrambled to fight back. It made permanent the appointment of Anne Stevens, a former Ford executive, as chief executive, unveiled plans to split the company’s two main divisions and announced a wide-ranging restructuring to boost cash generation.Some GKN’s investors told the FT that its new management had a challenging task to convince shareholders that the company should remain independent.However, a top-20 investor said Melrose also had work to do: “I don’t know Melrose, what is in their portfolio and what their plans are. If I am going to hold their paper I need to understand what it is I own.”That has put the credibility of a close-knit group of businessman atop Melrose on the line. Little-known outside of London financial circles, its record has won favour among an experienced band of investors in the City, who regularly back the rights issues that pay for their buyouts.Melrose’s executive chairman launched the group with his associate Mr Roper in 2003 using £3m of their own capital and £10m from investorsThe executive vice-chairman worked with Mr Miller at Wassall, which was sold to US buyout group KKR. Like Mr Miller, he is a chartered accountantMelrose looks to make money for shareholders by buying struggling industrial concerns. Though listed, it follows a strategy akin to private equity firms by cutting costs to lift margins, repairing the entity’s balance sheet and refocusing strategy, before trying to sell on at a premium.Mr Miller, who goes by Jock, co-founded Melrose with David Roper, a former investment banker who is nicknamed “the grinder” for his meticulous financial analysis of target companies, and chief executive Simon Peckham.Mr Miller and Mr Roper met working in Switzerland in the 1970s. They teamed up to forge an acquisition vehicle, Wassall, which was sold to US buyout group KKR for £627m in 2000 when its fortune stalled. The duo grew restless after an extended break and launched Melrose in 2003 with just over £3m of their own capital and £10m from investors.Mr Buxton says that unlike Lord Hanson, whom he described as an empire-builder, the Melrose leadership has evolved its model by selling on the companies they turn around and returning the gains to shareholders. “They do what it says on the tin, which is buy, improve, sell, and their track record speaks for itself.” People who have worked alongside the group say they are marked out by quick decision-making, whether on deals or implementing a new strategy at an acquired business.“They have a very small central core that does the acquisition work, then all the [work] is done directly with companies. They don’t have a lot of intermediate staff,” says Miles Templeman, the former senior non-executive director of Melrose.Melrose’s modus operandi involves first cutting costs deemed unnecessary by stripping out management and administrative layers. At Elster, the German-based utility metering business acquired in 2013 for £1.8bn, the head office was removed on “day one” without hesitation, says Mr Templeman. Melrose sold the business two years later for £3.3bn to Honeywell International, returning £2.4bn in cash to shareholders.This has delivered handsome returns for investors. The rewards have been rich for Melrose’s four top executives, who also include finance director Geoff Martin: they shared a £160m bonus pot last year under a five-year incentive plan.“If we put it in the context of private equity, it’s pretty average returns frankly,” says one investment banker.Staunch backers of Brexit, Mr Miller and Mr Roper in particular espouse a work-hard, play-hard ethos — finding time to enjoy long, wine-filled lunches alongside a healthy dose of watching rugby, playing golf and fishing.But not all their punts have come off. A notable exception is Brush, a remnant of a 2008 acquisition. A supplier of electricity generation equipment to the power, offshore and oil and gas sectors, the unit has foundered amid low crude prices and still sits on the group’s books.And not all companies have warmed to Melrose’s advances. A hostile bid in 2004 for Novar, a printing, metals and building company, was thwarted when Honeywell emerged as a “white knight”. In 2011, struggling UK engineer Charter resisted Melrose to hold out long enough for a higher offer from US group Colfax.With GKN, Melrose has stunned takeover veterans with the speed with which the group has moved, suggesting thorough preparation in the weeks before. GKN’s new management must now find a way to prove it has the credibility to preserve its independence. That battle is only just starting.Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger*This article has been amended to reflect that fact that Miles Templeman is the former senior non-executive director of Melrose.

Yet while the sector is keen to view this as a sign of the good times returning, market messages are mixed.The most recent business jet market report by Swiss bank UBS says used aircraft accounted for 10.5 per cent of the aircraft for sale in July. This was the lowest level since November 2007.“We’re now at a new beginning point of steady, healthy growth,” argues Chad Anderson, president of sales agent Jetcraft. “The market is back to a point where there is more than one buyer for aircraft that are correctly priced, marketed and positioned. Inventories are back to pre-recession levels.”Steve Varsano, who founded The Jet Business, broker of sales of super-midsize and larger business jets, says this is feeding into prices.“Prices of second-hand jets have come down drastically over the past two years,” he says. “Now prices are really starting to stabilise.”15%Reduction on the total number of recent model jets listed for resale YoYThe used-jet market has also acted as a brake on sales of new aircraft. In its latest Global Business Aviation Outlook last month, Honeywell, the industrial group, said this was one of a range of difficulties for plane makers.“Declining used aircraft prices, continued low commodities prices and economic and political uncertainties in many business-jet markets” remain concerns for new jet purchases, says Ben Driggs, president of Honeywell’s after-market sales in the Americas.Another important factor is the cost of depreciation. This will be “much more on a new jet than the maintenance cost on an old jet”, points out Oliver Stone, managing director of Colibri Aircraft, a European jet broker.The balance between depreciation and maintenance illustrates the case for buying nearly new planes, especially aircraft that are still under a manufacturer’s warranty or have a good maintenance contract.“Take a 2005 Bombardier Challenger 604,” says Mr Varsano. Owning that $6m large-cabin, long-range jet would cost about $400,000 a year in maintenance, he adds. “But if you spend $10m more you could get a 2014-15 Challenger 605. If borrowing costs are 3 to 4 per cent, the interest would be $300,000 to $400,000 a year. And with the newer aircraft you would have better reliability and a better residual value.”The falling prices of used aircraft have tempted new buyers, according to Mr Stone. “There’s been a pretty significant uptick in first-time buyers buying pre-owned aircraft,” he says.620-640Expected deliveries of new jets in 2017 according to HoneywellA huge number of aeroplane transactions are driven by a “liquidity event”, he adds. “People who have sold companies, or who have more cash flow from growth — they’ve been chartering for a while, and have seen the business benefits, so they want to try owning a plane.”Choosing the right aircraft is difficult, especially when rising numbers of buyers lack experience, says Mr Varsano. “Twenty years ago people first bought a small plane and worked their way up.” Now “more and more first-time buyers are getting into a bigger aircraft.”Catering to this is The Jet Business’s showroom on central London’s Park Lane. It contains a mock-up of an Airbus Corporate Jet cabin and a sophisticated computer tool that displays life-size images of jet interiors on a wall of screens. This allows buyers who may have little knowledge about aircraft to compare models easily, says Mr Varsano.He also stresses the interplay between the used and new jet markets, citing the Gulfstream G550. “There are about 540 in the world,” he says. There were about 35 for sale when deliveries of the more capable G650 started, he adds, partly from people upgrading to the newer jet. Now, of the G550s “with the preferred forward galley, less than five years old, there are just three for sale.”“Prices have come down so far, people are keeping their aircraft for longer,” he says. “It used to be four to five years. Now it’s six to seven years.”People used to buy a small plane and work their way up. Now more first-timers go for a bigger aircraftHoneywell’s expectation was of 620-640 new jets being delivered in the 12 months to the end of 2017 but statistics about the global fleet can be misleading, says Mr Versano. “A lot of aeroplanes are 30-40 years old,” he notes. “Fifty per cent are more than 30 years old. How many of those will get sold? I don’t know anyone buying a 30-year-old plane.”Mr Varsano, who started his aviation career in statistics, says a cut-off that excludes jets over three decades old would give a better idea of the state of the market. His figures put the number of jets for sale at 2,208, with 562, or just over a quarter, more than 30 years old.There is a problem with the oldest business jets, says Mr Stone of Colibri. “A Challenger 601 from the late 1980s that needs its engines overhauled will cost $1m per side . . . but then the aircraft will still be worth just $1.7m.”A looming concern is upgrades required by regulators to avionics equipment. One key US deadline is the end of the decade. There are not enough maintenance facilities to overhaul all the fleet, so “we’re starting to see a negative impact [on value] of not having had the upgrade done,” says Mr Stone.But opportunities exist in cheaper jets and what remains a sluggish market for used aircraft. Lower hardware prices are cutting jet chartering costs. Leasing company Global Jet Capital is putting its aircraft out to charter when it takes them back at lease-end, until they are sold or re-leased to new clients.Ben Murray, Global Jet senior managing director of asset management, says this can throw up customers who might never have thought of leasing. “We might approach a charterer [of the aircraft],” he says, “and actually sell them a lease.”
20;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2017-11-28T04:00:32Z;Helicopter manufacturers’ hopes rise with near 8% lift in sales;A recovery in orders follows several years of muted demand;Sales of helicopters are on an upward trend after years of flagging demand from operators in the energy sector.Helicopter makers report a rise of 7.7 per cent in civil deliveries in the first three quarters of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, to 661 aircraft, according to figures from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association released this month.Turbine helicopters accounted for 471 of those sales, a 5.6 per cent rise. The latest figures though should be set against a 16 per cent fall in the first three quarters of 2016 when compared with the same period in 2015.The lead manufacturer of civil rotorcraft is Airbus Helicopters, which delivered 242 worldwide in the first three quarters of 2017. Second place was taken by Robinson Helicopter, which delivered 220 mainly piston-engined helicopters in the same period. In third and fourth were Leonardo Helicopters and Bell Helicopter with 102 and 87, respectively.Airbus, in a 20-year forecast for the rotary industry, says it expects nearly 22,000 helicopter deliveries by 2036, worth €125bn. This would increase the global fleet from 25,000 helicopters to more than 37,400 in 2036 as a significant proportion of helicopters in use today remain in service.Worldwide, Asia is expected to take the largest proportion, at 35 per cent. The US and Canada follow at 22 per cent, with Europe at 18 per cent. Latin America is at 14 per cent, with Africa and the Middle East at 11 per cent.Rapid deregulation and the increasing pace of the creation of infrastructure in emerging countries will give scope for more sales, Airbus says.It expects emerging markets to take 80 per cent of rotorcraft deliveries over the next 20 years. China’s fleet is the world’s 11th biggest. In the past five years, however, the Chinese civil helicopter fleet has grown by 2.7 times and with more than 100 orders for civil helicopters in 2016, it ordered more than any other single country.The report, published in October, says orders for all civil helicopters were up just 3 per cent in the first half of 2017 compared with the same period a year before, but sees better prospects from 2018, in a business it estimates as being worth €370bn over the next 20 years.Aerospace company Honeywell, in its annual turbine-powered civil helicopter purchase outlook, published in March, expected 3,900 to 4,400 civil helicopters to be delivered in the five years to 2021. This is about 400 fewer than its forecast a year before.Slow economic growth and volatility in oil and gas markets were responsible for the extra caution in placing orders, it said.According to the Airbus report, there are 8,665 operators of an estimated 25,000 civil turbine helicopters worldwide.This highly fragmented market is ripe for consolidation, according to one operator that aims to bring the benefits of group structures to rotary operations, as it has done to the business jet market.Charlotte Pedersen, chief executive of Luxaviation Helicopters, says the group was the first to consolidate business jet operations in Europe. It manages more than 250 business aircraft and helicopters worldwide.This highly fragmented market ‘is ripe for consolidation’Luxaviation Helicopters, which began in February, acquired UK-based management, charter and training company Starspeed in September to become the world’s largest VIP rotary operator. Starspeed’s fleet of 19 managed aircraft and four others available for charter and training increased the Luxaviation rotary fleet to 42.The group is looking for greater volume in regions such as South Africa, Brazil and Switzerland, where chartering is not confined to the super-rich, Ms Pedersen says.Airbus is working on a high-speed compound rotorcraft concept as part of the European Clean Sky 2 initiative. It is also planning next year for the maiden flight of a vertical take-off aerial taxi, using ducted propellers powered by electric motors.Dubai aims to introduce the world’s first flying taxi service by 2020 and has test-flown a multi-engined electric machine made by German company Volocopter.While the city-state has already missed its own deadlines for introduction of such a service, it is helping to spur development of air taxis to tackle congestion on the ground within cities, and to connect to rapid air transport between cities.The trend is seen as inevitable by many. Bernhard Fragner, chief executive of GlobeAir, a conventional European air taxi service using light jets, says: “People don’t want to spend their time in airports. The future is electric, autonomous aircraft. And the speed of development is exponential.”

We are supportive of CEO Darius Adamczyk’s leadership and confident that his commitment to continuous portfolio optimisation will further improve shareholder value,” Third Point said in a statementHoneywell’s turbo technologies unit, which builds components that improve car and truck performance, is part of the aerospace business, but the rest of that unit will remain within the group.However, Mr Adamczyk said the remaining businesses in the core company “are best positioned to leverage Honeywell synergies from our technologies, financial and business models, and talent”. At the same time, the businesses being separated out will be “better positioned to maximise shareowner value through focused strategic decision-making and capital allocation”, he said.The independent Transportation Systems business will have annual revenues of around $3bn and 6,500 employees, while the Homes and Global Distribution business will have revenues of around $4.5bn and 13,000 employees. The homes business includes heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls, as well as security and fire protection products.Honeywell said the planned separations would not require a shareholder vote and were expected to be completed by the end of next year.Alongside the spin-off announcement, Honeywell also said it was on track to report strong third-quarter results, and upgraded the bottom end of the range for its full-year forecasts for the third time since April. The company said third-quarter sales were expected to be 3 per cent higher year on year, at around $10.1bn, with earnings per share up 9 per cent to $1.75 on a reported basis.Honeywell said it was confident of reporting full-year earnings per share of between $7.05 and $7.10, compared with previous guidance of $7.00 to $7.10.

25;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2017-10-06T17:42:39Z;Apple’s chief lawyer retires as it battles Qualcomm and Samsung;Bruce Sewell also led fight against FBI demand for help breaking iPhone encryption;Apple’s top lawyer, who has guided it through battles with Samsung and Qualcomm and taken on the US government over iPhone security, is retiring, as the Silicon Valley company brings in a new general counsel from Honeywell.Bruce Sewell, who is 59, became Apple’s general counsel in 2009 and will step down at the end of the year.Kate Adams, formerly of US industrial conglomerate Honeywell, will take a seat on Apple’s executive team, reporting directly to chief executive Tim Cook, and lead global security, as part of her new role as general counsel. Mr Sewell’s departure comes as Apple is taking on Qualcomm on several fronts, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for its wireless modem technology and patents, in a legal battle that has also embroiled several of the iPhone’s top suppliers in Asia. Its patent battle against Samsung over iPhone designs is still rolling through the courts.Apple is also fighting the European Commission over what Brussels claims is €13bn in illegal tax benefits from Ireland. This week, the EU said it would take Ireland to court to force it to recover the sum from Apple. “The move takes on greater significance given the number of battles Apple is facing in and out of the courtroom,” said Neil Cybart, an Apple analyst at Above Avalon.“While there is never a perfect time for such a transition, it makes sense for Apple to pass on the baton to a new general counsel sooner rather than later given the company’s intensifying war with Qualcomm.”Mr Cook said in a statement on Friday that he was thrilled to welcome Ms Adams, who will help steer the company’s legal strategy on issues ranging from customer privacy to intellectual property. “She’s a seasoned leader with outstanding judgment and has worked on a wide variety of legal cases globally. Throughout her career she’s also been an advocate on many of the values we at Apple hold dear,” he said.He also thanked Mr Sewell for having “tirelessly defended our IP, our customers’ right to privacy and our values”.Apple has used privacy and security issues to differentiate itself from Silicon Valley rivals such as Google and Amazon.In 2016, it found itself in conflict with the US government, when FBI investigators into the San Bernardino shooting asked for assistance in circumventing the encryption that locked the attacker’s iPhone.Apple, whose legal response was led by Mr Sewell, argued that it could not help the FBI break into the device because doing so would compromise all its customers’ security. Ms Adams said that she was “excited to help Apple continue to grow and evolve around the world, protecting their ideas and IP, and defending our shared values”.To replace Ms Adams, Honeywell on Friday named Anne Madden, who has served as vice-president of corporate development and global head of mergers & acquisitions since 2002, as its new general counsel.Before joining Apple, Mr Sewell worked in Intel’s legal team for many years. He also serves as a director of Vail Resorts, which owns ski resorts including Whistler in Canada, Northstar in California’s Lake Tahoe and Park City, Utah. In line with other Apple executives’ pay, Mr Sewell received $22.8m in total compensation in 2016, according to regulatory filings, including $20m worth of stock awards and $1m salary.

One person following the situation closely said the price would likely end up valuing Rockwell at around $140 per share.Shares in North Carolina-based Rockwell climbed 2.2 per cent to $130.76, giving the company a market value of $21.2bn excluding debt.A deal would make United Technologies — a $93bn group which makes everything from air conditioning units and moving walkways to jet engines — an even more critical supplier of components to companies like Boeing and Airbus.The two sides have been rumoured to be in talks for weeks after an initial leak earlier this month. Last week Rockwell withdrew from an industry conference, fuelling speculation that it was locked in deal negotiations. The company’s stock price has climbed 40 per cent since the start of the year.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the two sides were nearing a deal.For Rockwell, a takeover would come just months after it closed on an acquisition of B/E Aerospace, which supplies cabin interior systems such as seats, galleys and lavatories, for $8.6bn, including debt.A deal would come some 18 months after United Technologies’ larger rival Honeywell attempted to acquire the company. United Technologies argued forcefully that a deal would not get through competition authorities, while key customers Airbus and Bombardier opposed a transaction.

The solid results and upbeat outlook should bolster new chief executive Darius Adamczyk’s defense against activist investor Dan Loeb, who has been agitating for the company to spin off its aerospace business.For the three months to end of June, net sales rose 1 per cent to $10.1bn, easily cruising past the $9.88bn that Wall Street was expecting. Within this like-for-like sales were up 3 per cent, with the gauge gaining across all four of its divisions during the period.In the aerospace unit, Honeywell’s biggest, the commercial aviation after-sales business benefited from robust air travel and the growth in US military spending.Net income climbed 5.5 per cent to $1.4bn during the quarter, also ahead of analysts estimates of $1.36bn. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $1.80, up from $1.64 in the prior year period and beating forecasts for $1.77.As a result of the strong first quarter performance, New Jersey-based Honeywell said it was raising the low end of its full year guidance by 10 cents. It now sees 2017 earnings per share at between $7.00 to $7.10, excluding divestitures, any pension mark-to-market adjustments, and 2016 debt refinancing charges.It also upgraded its view on full-year sales to $39.3bn-$40bn, compared to the $38.6bn-$39.5bn range it had previously forecast. Within this, organic sales is expected to rise between 2-4 per cent.“We expect continued momentum in organic sales growth throughout 2017, supported by strong order rates and a growing backlog across many of our businesses,” said Mr Adamczyk, who took over the top job in April.Shares in Honeywell, which closed at a record high on Thursday, gained as much as 1 per cent in pre-market trading.

Mr Cote said there were “real” animal spirits stirring at the start of the year, but that had since faded.European capex sagged to a three-decade low as the eurozone crisis roiled the region, but UBS notes that its survey of 1,200 corporate executives across the continent points to a pick-up in 2017.Still, Thierry Breton, the chairman and chief executive of French technology company Atos, is also cautious on the prospects of a capex renaissance, warning that it was too soon to make big investments based on the recent increase in economic sentiment.Citi noted that its forecast for improving corporate investments was not coming at the expense of shareholder payouts through dividends and stock buybacks, which have climbed to a succession of records in recent years.

However, revenue dipped 0.3 per cent to $9.49bn as the strong dollar lowered the value of the group’s overseas earnings. Still the revenue was better than the drop to $9.32bn that the market was expecting.Net income jumped nearly 9 per cent to $1.32bn as better cost controls helped fatten margins across all four divisions. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $1.66, well ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.625.Shares rose 0.6 per cent in pre-market trading.As a result of the strong first quarter performance, New Jersey-based Honeywell said it was raising the low end of its full year guidance by 5 cents.

Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported earnings of $1.74 a share in line with estimates.Sales were flat at $9.98bn just shy of analysts’ estimates of $10.1bn. Sales in aerospace, the company’s largest division, fell 5 per cent on an organic basis from a year ago, driven by lower volumes in business jets and continued weakness in the helicopter business.The results were also impacted by program completions in US space and international defense businesses. However, sales in its home and building technologies unit and its performance and materials technologies unit were up.That saw shares slide 2.5 per cent to $115 in pre-market trading.Honeywell reaffirmed the 2017 forecast is issued last month, with adjusted earnings expected to grow between six to 10 per cent in a range of $6.85 to $7.10 a share, and projected that organic sales could rise between one to three per cent. However it did say that reported sales could fall by as much as 1 per cent to $39.2bn or rise 2 per cent to $40.1bn.For the current quarter, the company expects to earn between $1.60 to $1.64 a share, compared with estimates of $1.62.In an effort to drive growth and diversify away from jet engines and building control systems, Honeywell is pushing to transform to a software-industrial company.The results will be the last under chief executive Dave Cote who will step-down in March after 14 years at the helm. Mr Cote is credited with helping turn the company around and under his leadership the company spent more than $8bn in nine acquisitions since 2015. But he is also remembered for his failed bid last year to buy United Technologies in a $90bn deal. Chief operating officer Darius Adamcyzk has been tapped to succeed him.Shares in Honeywell climbed nearly 13 per cent last year and have advanced 1.8 per cent so far this year.

These included BP and Royal Dutch Shell, the energy groups, GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical maker, and Unilever, the consumer goods group.Seven companies would need a payment of more than two years’ dividends into their defined benefit (DB) pension scheme to clear the outstanding deficit.“We did not find much evidence of employers adjusting their dividend policies following guidance from the Pensions Regulator,” said Charles Cowling, director at JLT.“However, it is the case that some companies could, and should, pay off deficits, possibly by reducing, even withholding, dividends, or more likely by borrowing from the capital markets.”He said that paying pension deficits by withholding dividends would help to preserve shareholder value.The Pensions Regulator last year suggested that many FTSE 350 employers were able to maintain, or even increase, contributions to repair pension deficits given that profits had increased.Since this guidance, pension deficits for the UK’s 6,000 private-sector DB schemes — as measured on an accounting basis — increased to £360bn at the end of 2016, according to PwC.Employer groups defended the shareholder payouts, saying they were “fully committed” to paying pensions promised to existing and former staff.“The best way to do this is by focusing on securing the ongoing health of the organisation,” said Neil Carberry, director of employment, skills and public services with the CBI, the voice for 190,000 businesses.The Pensions Regulator said: “We understand that investing for growth in their business will mean some employers cannot increase these payments but expect them to discuss this openly with their trustees.”It went on: “It is important that employers treat their pension scheme fairly and we expect trustees to question employers’ dividend policies where deficit repair contributions are constrained.”The JLT report said there were a “significant” number of FTSE 100 companies whose pension schemes were a “material risk” to the business as their liabilities were greater than their equity market value, including IAG, BAE Systems, RBS and Sainsbury.The analysis comes as the pace of closure of DB schemes among FTSE 100 companies quickens, with lower-than-expected bond yields and increasing life expectancy contributing to rising pension costs.Last week Royal Mail announced it had begun consulting workers on the fate of its 90,000-member defined benefits scheme. In recent months, Tata Steel UK, BMW, Marks and Spencer and US multinational Honeywell have laid out similar plans.“We believe that next year’s accounts will show that the majority of FTSE 100 companies have ceased DB provision to all employees,” forecast JLT.The report noted that the average pension scheme asset allocation to bonds had increased from 59 per cent to 61 per cent, even as the price of these assets climbed to record highs.Ease pension issues with a virtuous borrowing cycle / From John Ralfe"

34;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
35;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-12-16T05:51:43Z;Start-ups in Chicago find that focus on B2B clients pays off;Innovative apps address real-life needs in the city’s traditional industries;"When Jim Boccarossa met Stephanie Murphy, he did not know anything about the aviation industry. She had spent 10 years in the business, however, brokering spare parts.“We were dating and I found it very interesting that it might be the biggest small industry you’ve never heard of,” he says. He also, he adds, found that the system the aerospace industry used for buying and selling parts “archaic”.The participants included well known groups such as Boeing, Airbus, GE and Honeywell — some of the biggest companies in the world — but they were “buying and selling parts using technology from the 1980s”. Mr Boccarossa had founded a few start-ups and he and Ms Murphy sensed a chance to combine expertise.Two years ago, Ms Murphy launched Air Spares Unlimited — an online brokerage for landing gear, wheels and brakes — and brought in Mr Boccarossa, now her husband, to be its chief executive.The company is one of many that form the core of the technology scene in Chicago, which tends to tilt away from the glamorous social media apps of the US coasts, and toward start-ups serving other businesses or the industries that have deep roots in the region, such as manufacturing and logistics. Even the better-known Chicago-born Groupon, the site which offers daily deals on goods and services to retail customers, has strong connections to the city’s corporate past. It is housed in the former home of Montgomery Ward, the mail-order catalogue giant that was an antecedent to ecommerce.One reason for the Chicago tech scene’s low-key approach, Mr Boccarossa says, is that tech talent in the city has “realistic business expectations”.“They understand that this isn’t building an app so I can take a picture to send to my friends; this is building software so people can buy wheels to land a plane,” he says. “We’re building real B2B technology . . . you have real companies here who look at real revenue streams to solve real-life problems.”If you’re a start-up you need a paying customer, and there’s a lot of them in ChicagoLinda Darragh, who taught Mr Boccarossa at the Innovation and Entrepreneur Initiative at Northwestern University’s Kellogg business school, says the diversity of Chicago’s economy — in which no industry accounts for more than about 15 per cent of city GDP — is a leading driver.“I see Chicago as basically a Petri dish for entrepreneurs to test and build tech-enablement for existing established industries, so you start looking at what industries are in Chicago, it’s all over the place — it’s everything from healthcare to transportation,” she says. “So there’s a lot of opportunity to really get into the ecosystem of an industry and improve upon it.”UI Labs provides those kinds of opportunities. It is a public-private, non-profit “innovation accelerator” that receives funding from major industrial companies such as Caterpillar, GE and Deere, and from the government. One focus, says Caralynn Nowinski Collens who heads the organisation, is manufacturing. UI Labs is running more than 30 industrial projects through its labs and its factory floor.“We have so many legacy strengths in old-line legacy industries — not the sexy ones, but things like construction or manufacturing,” she says.Trend of moving out to the suburbs is now being reversedThe city has bolstered those roots with over 100 entrepreneurial environments, including accelerators, incubators, co-working spaces and innovation hubs, says Mark Tebbe, chair of Chicago Next, a tech-focused group connected to the city’s economic development organisation.The group has created industry-specific incubators for financial technology linked to Chicago’s long history with the futures industry, with water — given the city’s place on the shores of Lake Michigan — and with manufacturing. “You have a diversified base of businesses [and industries] to work with,” says Mr Tebbe, a former tech entrepreneur. “This makes for a strong customer base — if you’re a start-up or a tech company, the one thing you need is a paying customer and there’s a lot of them in Chicago.”Jodi Navta, chief marketing officer for Coyote, the logistics company that last year was sold to UPS for $1.8bn, agrees. “Being the epicentre of the Midwest is good for a lot of reasons: there are a lot of businesses that we can help locally, a lot of carriers that we can build relationships with that are local,” she says.A diversified business landscape gives rise to companies like SMS Assist, which in June raised $150m from Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, giving it a $1bn valuation. SMS manages 25,000 property management subcontractors in over 135,000 client locations. “You wouldn’t think of a maintenance company with 100 to 150 code-writing technologists,” says its chief Mike Rothman.Four Kites is a logistics company founded by Matt Elenjickal, who spent years working in supply chain management. He says one reason such low-glamour companies have taken off in the city is because local venture capital firms are willing to take risks on businesses that may not generate headlines.“There are a lot of VC firms in Chicago who really focus on B2B, who focus on these industries that are not sexy,” he says.*This article has been amended since original publication to clarify SMS Assist’s business operations."
36;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-12-14T15:51:55Z;Airlines bid to beat their weight problem;Fuelled by leaps in technology and materials, the industry is on a mission to lighten the load of aircraft;A few years ago Japan’s ANA airline asked passengers to use the toilet before boarding their flights. The logic was that if every passenger took a comfort break in advance, the aircraft’s load would be lighter and the engines would burn less fuel.The trial only lasted a month, but it highlighted the aerospace industry’s weight obsession. Weight is one of the three most important factors, after aerodynamics and engine performance, affecting the efficiency of an aircraft. Less fuel means lower carbon dioxide emissions, as well as savings on a significant operating cost for airlines. Finding new ways to slim down the global fleet is preoccupying the aerospace industry as it prepares for the next generation of aircraft, expected to start flying before 2030. In October, governments agreed the world’s first global climate deal for the aviation industry, which accounts for 2 per cent of all CO2 emissions. With the number of air passengers set to jump from 3.6bn last year to 16bn by 2050, according to Iata, the trade body, every aspect of aviation is being scrutinised to cut growing emissions.“If you take 1,000lbs [454kg] out of the weight of an engine that is worth 1 per cent of fuel. It is a big financial saving but also good for the environment,” says Ric Parker, former director of research and technology at Rolls-Royce and now chairman of the EU’s Clean Sky initiative. “Anything you can do to reduce weight is a good thing.”The extensive use of new materials — including carbon fibre reinforced polymer — has led to huge weight savings. Composite materials were introduced in 1985 on the tail fin of aircraft such as the Airbus A310 wide-body. Today, Boeing and Airbus have broken new ground with their latest wide-body models, the 787 and A350. Roughly half of these aircraft is made of carbon fibre plastic and other composite materials. Boeing boasts that the 787 — whose smallest model weighs 161 tonnes — offers a 20 per cent weight saving compared with the equivalent aluminium aircraft. Scroll down for graphics looking at where the weight is being lost ——————————-Engine makers, too, are finding ways to lighten their turbines — on average weighing 6,350kg each for large jets. Roughly 340kg can be cut from a wide-body engine by using composite materials for fan blades and the fan case, according to Rolls-Royce. Titanium aluminide, an even newer material that replaces heavier nickel alloys, can make further reductions in the hottest parts of an engine. It is a virtuous circle, says Mr Parker. “If you put on a blade that is one-third the weight you can have a turbine disc that is lighter as well. And then the casing can be lighter and thinner. The positive benefit goes round and round.”Other advanced materials, such as lighter metal alloys and graphene, are also making a difference. Geoff Hunt, chief engineer at UTC Aerospace Systems, says titanium alloys have reduced the weight of landing gear by thousands of kilogrammes on the biggest jets. Hundreds more can also be saved with carbon technology, new painting techniques and changes to sealant, according to PPG, a coatings company. “If you can reduce the load you can reduce the reinforcement of the structure,” says Robert Lafontan, senior vice-president of engineering at Airbus.Today’s aircraft are not necessarily lighter, however. Many of the pounds shed in recent years have simply made room for new features or more passengers. Boeing introduced larger windows on its 787, which would have had a “prohibitive” impact on weight without savings elsewhere, says Larry Schneider, chief programme engineer for the 777. Regulators are also raising safety standards. The requirement for safer seats a decade ago added some 5 tonnes (5,000kg) to the average weight of an aircraft, for example. Recaro, the German-based seat supplier, says it has shed all of that weight and more with slimline composite frames. Pre-reclined seats have done away with the need for heavy mechanical components that allow movement. Power consumption is also rising, creating a need for heavier wiring and more heat management. The average large commercial passenger jet has about 40 per cent more electronics than a few years ago, according to TE Connectivity. Up to 60 per cent of the weight of wiring — which could amount to 5,700kg on a superjumbo — could be cut by switching from copper to aluminium. New manufacturing methods such as 3D printing offer radical ways to design aircraft and components. “Through 3D printing you can actually make the strength where you need it . . . and take out all the other weight,” says Bob Smith, chief technology officer at Honeywell Aerospace.Electrically powered aircraft, where much development funding is being focused, also have the potential to be lighter and more fuel efficient. Russ Dunn, a senior vice-president of GKN, the UK aerospace supplier, says the combination of new technology and materials will revolutionise aircraft design and the way passengers travel. By 2050 those 16bn air passengers may be enjoying a radically different experience — with one exception: the toilets may be made of lighter materials, but it would be a brave airline that decides to do away with them altogether.Graphics by Ian BottCockpit Airlines have replaced the pilot’s 18kg (40lb) flight bag, holding manual and maps, with lighter electronic tablets. LED displays also require thinner, lighter screens.Fuselage Boeing’s 787 broke new ground with a lighter composite fuselage made all in one piece. This did away with the need for thousands of fasteners to hold it together, helping to cut the weight of the aircraft by 20 per cent.Engines Engine manufacturers are investing heavily in weight saving technology to offset ever larger engines. Making fan blades and the fan case from carbon fibre composite materials can cut 340kg out of an engine, says Rolls-Royce. Using ceramic matrix composites in the hottest parts of the engine can eliminate even more. General Electric is making further gains through 3D technology. It recently printed a third of a turboprop engine, which weighs 5 per cent less than the traditional propeller system and reduces fuel burn by 1 per cent. The potential is clear for jet engines.Tail skid Replacing the alloy tail skid that protects the back of the fuselage on take-off with an electronic warning system has cut 147kg from the 777-300ER.Electrification Electrical systems have been used on the 787 to replace some heavy, mechanically controlled systems. Research is now focused on the potential for electric propulsion, which one day might result in fewer gas turbines powering an aircraft. Given the state and weight of batteries, however, this is still a long way in the future.Galleys Eliminating hot meals on selected flights has allowed some airlines to remove ovens, waste compactors and entire galleys.Wings Composite materials are reducing the weight of wings but a lightning strike would punch straight through without the inclusion of metallic elements. To avoid adding that extra weight, European researchers are working on using the conductivity of carbon nanotube materials in wings to protect against lightning strikes.Seat The requirement for added safety features increased the weight of the average economy seat by 50 per cent to 15kg. Replacing aluminium alloys with composite materials and a slimmer design have brought the average weight back to 10kg, and allowed airlines to squeeze in more passengers.Windows Pressurised cabins put huge strain on windows, which require big load-bearing frames for protection. But advances in transparency technology mean the windows can now take the structural load, eliminating the need for the frames and some 250kg-300kg, according to PPG. Eventually there may be no need for windows at all beyond the cockpit, if aircraft are lined with flexible displays depicting a variety of soothing scenes.Wheels New rubber technology has shed 50kg from the 12 tyres on a Boeing 777-300ER wide-body jet.Brakes The shift from conventional to carbon brakes cut 907kg from the weight of the 747’s 16 braking systems, according to UTC Aerospace Systems.Sealant Chemical advances have led to meaningful reductions in the weight of sealant used across the airframe. Today’s sealant is 30 per cent lighter than the formulas used 20 years ago, saving as much as 544kg on a widebody aircraft.Cabling and wiring Replacing copper with aluminium wires could save up to 60 per cent of the 1,200kg of cabling on the typical single-aisle jet. But if carbon nanotubes are proven to be reliable conductors, weight reduction could reach as much as 70 per cent. Managing heat dissipation allows engineers to reduce the conductor diameter, saving up to 20 per cent of the weight.Washers Boeing has saved 53kg by eliminating the need for 20,000 washers on the 777-300ER.Paint Painting and coating the outside of a superjumbo like the A380 adds between 650kg and 1,000kg, and significantly more if the weight of coating all the components is included. New techniques such as electrically charging parts before dipping them in a paint bath could save 30-70 per cent of the weight on 3m-4m components. 
37;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-11-09T08:21:22Z;US chief executives write open letter to Trump seeking reassurances;Businesses express concern about threats to trade, but see opportunities in tax cuts;"Chief executives from more than 1,100 US companies, including Boeing, Coca-Cola and Caterpillar, have written an open letter to Donald Trump, warning of “an urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions” after the election.The letter comes as business executives on both sides of the Atlantic have expressed concern about uncertainty and threats to trade in the wake of Mr Trump’s victoryBut some US corporate chieftans see opportunities in possible tax cuts and deregulation.In the chief executives’ letter, prepared for whichever candidate won the presidential election, they say they are committed to reuniting the country “after this particularly difficult election, and warn that businesses and communities cannot prosper “in a country that is divided and distrustful”.Other signatories to the letter, organised by the National Association of Manufacturers, include the chief executives of Pfizer, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Eli Lilly and Cargill.In Europe, Emma Marcegaglia urged Mr Trump to reach out. “We hope to see signals of reconciliation and reassurance rapidly. The United States are and will remain the most important partner of the European Union in shaping a fair and rule-based globalisation to the benefit of all.“The 45th President of the US is an entrepreneur. We hope that his decisions will be driven by political and economic reason,” she added.US businesses and industry groups were generally not supporters of Mr Trump. Only 17 per cent of trade associations thought his presidency would be best for their members, compared with 39 per cent favouring Hillary Clinton, a recent survey by the Financial Times found.Not one chief executive of the 100 largest companies in the US had given money to Mr Trump’s campaign by August, according to the Wall Street Journal.Companies including United Technologies and Ford were attacked by Mr Trump during the campaign for relocating production out of the US to Mexico and other countries with lower labour costs, and every business with an international supply chain or market is nervous about potential disruption from new trade barriers.But businesses are also looking for opportunities to work with his administration to achieve their policy goals, including measures to stimulate economic growth.Jay Timmons, president of the NAM, said: “When you have an economy that’s not working as it should, with people being displaced out of jobs, frustrated with their economic progress and with their families’ standing, then you’re going to have this kind of negative response and reaction . . . But the solution is what the business community offers.”One clear gain for businesses in Mr Trump’s programme is his proposed cut in federal business taxes to 15 per cent, from the current 35 per cent.The big US banks are likely to see Mr Trump’s victory as a positive. He has sent mixed signals on financial regulation, but said he wants a policy that is “close to dismantling” Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform act. That law imposed a host of tough rules on the banks and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has held them to higher regulatory standards.Some analysts suggest that Mr Trump’s rhetoric may run ahead of reality.“Trump has said he’s going to tear up Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act; I don’t think he can do either,” said John Stadtler, head of the financial services practice at PwC in New York.“I don’t think he’ll be able to undo the CFPB either, but he will certainly drive change.”Still, Mr Trump has also suggested he wants tighter regulation of banks through a “21st century Glass-Steagall”: the 1933 law that kept commercial banks out of investment banking and insurance, which was repealed in 1999.The most positive news for the banks is the senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have been critical of the big banks, will be shut out of policymaking.Privately, many top bankers said they resented the way Ms Warren’s wing of the Democratic party appeared to have taken control of financial policy. In particular, they said they worried that potential candidates to serve as Treasury secretary — including Larry Fink, the chairman of BlackRock — seemed to have been blacklisted by Ms Warren, because of their experience on Wall Street.However, if a Trump presidency means that a December interest rate rise is less likely — and financial markets suggested it was, late on Tuesday — then banks will not be pleased. A steeper yield curve normally means higher income for banks, which earn big chunks of their profits from the difference between short-term and long-term rates.Trump has said he’s going to tear up Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act; I don’t think he can do eitherFor retailers and consumer goods companies tax reductions could help, but Mr Trump’s immigration and trade policies could have a bigger and more damaging impact, analysts said.Neil Saunders, an analyst at Conlumino, said: “Mr Trump’s policies could be quite far-reaching for retail, especially in terms of the labour market becoming more restricted [if immigration is curbed] and products becoming more expensive if import taxes are introduced. The latter is a major issue given how interconnected supply chains are.”Mr Trump has already singled out Mondelez International, which makes Oreos, for shifting some of its production to Mexico.However, Mr Saunders added that Congress could temper Mr Trump’s more radical proposals.Another industry that could benefit from Mr Trump’s presidency is oil and gas. He has proposed opening up new areas for oil and gas development, including federal lands and waters that are presently closed to exploration, and promised to “rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions”.Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry group, said there was “not a lot” of detail about Mr Trump’s plans, but his pledges could mean he would stem and reverse the “tsunami” of new federal regulations on oil and gas put forward by the Obama administration.Mr Gerard added that Mr Trump’s support for new pipeline projects could help unlock investment that had been held up by objections raised by the Obama administration.Some companies in other sectors may have less of a free hand. Mr Trump’s victory could be bad news for AT&T’s proposed $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner.The combination of America’s largest telecoms group by market value with the owner of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros was announced last month. The deal faces a year of regulatory scrutiny.But in a speech last month Mr Trump said he would block the transaction. “AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” he said."
38;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-10-21T11:25:00Z;Honeywell’s profit drops as aerospace sales weaken;;US industrial conglomerate Honeywell said profits slid in the third quarter due to a continued slump in its aerospace business but investors investors breathed a sigh of relief as the company met its lowered expectations for revenue and earnings.Earnings per share were $1.60 in the third quarter, in line with the downward-revised projection Honeywell unveiled a few weeks earlier and consistent with analysts’ predictions. Adjusted for restructuring costs, earnings per share were $1.67, beating the $1.60 expected by analysts, according to Bloomberg.Revenue rose 2 per cent year-on-year to $9.8bn in the three months ended in September, in line with Wall Street’s expectations, while third-quarter net income was $1.25bn, just under the $1.28bn from the third quarter in 2015. Its aerospace division continued to drag, as it reported a 6 per cent fall in sales, to $3.6bn, compared to a year earlier.The company lowered its full-year sales outlook to between $39.4bn to $39.6bn, from its previous expectations for $40bn to $40.6bn. The company said it expects earnings in the range of $6.60 to $6.64 a share, the same narrowed range it set out a few weeks ago.Honeywell’s shares have recovered in the last few weeks after seeing a sharp sell-off earlier this month when it cut its sales and earnings outlook for 2016 as orders for its commercial aircraft business dropped. Honeywell stock, which is up about 5 per cent so far this year, was up about 1.7 per cent in pre-market trading.

The sell-off wiped $6.6bn off of Honeywell’s market capitalisation.Other stocks with similar exposure to the aviation industry also came under selling pressure. Rival United Technologies, which Honeywell tried to acquire this year, fell 1.5 per cent, General Electric lost 0.7 per cent, while smaller parts suppliers such as Triumph Group and Parker-Hannifin shed 5.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively.The wider S&P aerospace and defence sector index declined 0.8 per cent to 774.73.Honeywell said it now expected third-quarter earnings to come in at $1.60 a share on sales of about $9.8bn. This compares with its previous EPS forecast of $1.67-$1.72 and sales estimates of $10bn-$10.2bn.The company also lowered the upper end of its adjusted full-year earnings guidance to $6.60-$6.64, down from $6.60-$6.70.“As we’re seeing across the aerospace industry, conditions are more difficult than anticipated in both the business jet OEM [Original Equipment Manufacturer] and after-market businesses,” said Thomas Szlosek, chief financial officer, in a call with analysts on Friday.“Weakness in the oil and gas industry is impacting both business jet flying hours and our commercial helicopter business, which resides in defence and space. Finally, customer inventory levels and productivity solutions are unusually high and causing a temporary slowdown in revenue growth.”Elsewhere, Gap shares rallied after the US retailer revealed upbeat September sales figures at its Old Navy brand.Same-store sales, an important metric for retailers, climbed 4 per cent last month at Old Navy, or about 6 per cent excluding the impacts of a fire that struck at a distribution centre in upstate New York. That widely beat estimates of a 0.7 per cent rise, and also the 4 per cent pace logged last September.“The results at Old Navy are encouraging, and we believe [the fall product line-up] is both appealing and well-assorted,” said Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe.The performance at Old Navy is closely scrutinised by analysts since Gap’s higher-end name brand and Banana Republic have faced increased pressure from a shift by consumers to discount retailers, as well as fast fashion groups that look to emulate runway styles at an inexpensive price point.Still, Mr Jaffe noted that Gap’s troubles were still probably not yet out of the way: “We anticipate continued challenges in the near term at both the Gap and Banana divisions, despite management’s best efforts to improve product”, he said.Shares in Gap, which is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings in mid-November, rallied 15.2 per cent on Friday to $26.25. They are still down 7.5 per cent over the past 12 months.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent to 2,153.7, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by 0.2 per cent to 18,240.5, and the Nasdaq Composite edged lower by 0.3 per cent to 5,292.4.

The sell-off wiped off more than $7.1bn off of Honeywell’s market capitalisation.Other stocks with similar exposure to the aviation industry also came under selling pressure. Rival United Technologies, which Honeywell tried to acquire earlier this year, fell 2.1 per cent, General Electric lost 1 per cent while smaller parts suppliers such as Triumph Group and Parker Hannifin shed 5.2 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.The S&P aerospace and defense sector index dropped 1.4 per cent to a one month low of 770.42.Honeywell said it now expected third quarter earnings to come in at $1.60 per share on sales of around $9.8bn.

41;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-10-01T06:03:26Z;Honeywell makes plans to close UK defined benefit pension scheme;US industrial giant on potential collision course with Britain’s biggest trade union;Honeywell has made plans to close its UK defined benefit pension scheme, which has put the US industrial giant on a potential collision course with Britain’s biggest trade union.The proposed closure, which will affect 1,300 employees, comes a year after the Fortune 100 company’s £3.3bn purchase of Melrose Industries’ Elster meter business, which included the transfer of three pension schemes with combined deficits of £134m.Honeywell said the move to shut the final salary pension scheme had nothing to do with the acquisition of Elster’s pension plans, and was not part of wider cost-cutting measures.“This proposed change is in line with UK market trends, with approximately half of FTSE 100 companies either having no defined benefit scheme or freezing their DB schemes to future accruals,” Honeywell said in a statement.A spokesperson added: “I want to stress this is only a proposal at this stage. A final decision on how to proceed will be made in November.”Honeywell has invited members of the final salary pension plan to join its defined contribution scheme, which invests employer and employee contributions in the stock market. Honeywell, which posted a profit of $1.26bn in April, said 75 per cent of its UK employees are enrolled in the defined contribution scheme.Linda McCulloch, national officer for Unite, Britain’s biggest trade union, said: “Unite members are very disappointed that Honeywell, a very profitable company, has seen fit to propose closure of its defined benefit scheme and to offer members a poor-quality defined contribution scheme, given that such plans rely on the vagaries of the stock market. The management is not offering any compensation for this proposed change.”“We recognise that current market conditions are creating big problems for defined benefit pension schemes, but our members do not accept that closure of these schemes is inevitable.”Pensions consultant John Ralfe said the planned closure was not a surprise. “Many larger DB schemes and virtually all small and medium-sized enterprises’ schemes are now closed. Everyone is doing it.”Unite will meet union representatives at Honeywell about the proposed closure on October 7.Mrs McCulloch said: “The proposals affect 1,300 employees. Unfortunately, the American-owned company has, so far, firmly resisted national consultation on the pensions issue. If members do not accept that the employer has made a reasonable case for any pension changes then the union will give them its full support in resisting those changes.”
42;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Free trade v populism: The fight for America’s economy;The presidential campaign’s protectionist rhetoric is threatening global commerce;"On a bright Saturday morning the congressman for Nebraska’s second congressional district is pressing the flesh with his constituency’s growing Latino community. Trailing the loping, silver-haired Democrat closely as he works the crowd at Omaha’s annual El Grito parade is a translator who repeats quietly in Spanish: “His name is Brad Ashford. He is your representative in Washington.”Minutes behind, jogging from side to side along the parade route, is Brigadier General (Retired) Don Bacon, a pro-gun, anti-abortion, arch-conservative running as a political outsider to replace Mr Ashford. With “Everybody Loves Bacon” as his campaign slogan, the former US Air Force general’s band of clean-cut, young and overwhelmingly white volunteers is doing everything it can to fire up a Latino crowd that is responding with striking indifference.“What do we like? Bacon!” one volunteer yells into a megaphone. “Where do we want it? Congress!”Viewed from the parade route, the race for Nebraska’s second district — whose most famous constituent is legendary investor Warren Buffett— looks like the usual election fare. But this year it is emblematic of a bigger ideological battle. As populist politicians around the world like Donald Trump try to tap into a rich vein of discontent with globalisation, the district is part of a calculated campaign by business and pro-free market groups to fight back.There is no doubt that globalisation is facing its biggest political test in decades. The UK’s June vote to leave the EU and the prospect that this year’s US presidential contest could see the election of an avowed protectionist have raised fears that the model that has governed the global economy for more than 70 years is unravelling.So too has the growing opposition in the US and Europe to trade deals such as US President Barack Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership and the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.But the “globalists” — as Mr Trump dubs them — are fighting back. For all its failings, they argue, globalisation has been good for the world economy, lifting a billion people out of poverty in the developing world and helping to increase living standards in rich economies.Mr Ashford, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, is embroiled in the fight because he is a rare bird in American politics today: a centrist, pro-trade Democrat.Unlike most of his party’s members of the House of Representatives — or either of the two main presidential candidates — Mr Ashford is an unabashed backer of the TPP, which Mr Obama negotiated with Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim economies and hopes to pass through Congress later this year.“Here so many of our manufacturing and [agriculture] related businesses are trade dependent. The more we expand trade with Asia the more people we are going to be able to employ and wages are going to go up,” Mr Ashford says. “I’m willing to talk about trade and talk about increasing people’s opportunities here. And I don’t know why people don’t put them together.”The stand has won him the backing of the US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups that normally lean toward small-government Republicans. This year the business lobby is doing everything it can to preserve a pro-trade majority in Congress — regardless of what happens in a presidential campaign in which trade is a toxic word.Besides Mr Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway group, Mr Ashford’s big backers this year include multinationals such as Deere & Co and Honeywell as well as the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and other big farm groups. Together, they have given Mr Ashford a two-to-one fundraising advantage over his Republican rival, who in any other election year might have been a more natural target of their largesse.That sort of support is being replicated across the US, with business groups and the Obama administration working particularly hard to secure the 218 votes they will need to get the TPP through the House of Representatives, the lower house of Congress, after the November 8 election.But the real fight goes far beyond the US and the fate of the TPP. For many business leaders, there is deep concern over the direction of the global economy itself.—————-Controversial deals 1: TPPWhat is it? A trade deal between the US, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim countries — but not China — was signed in February 2016. It covers some 40 per cent of the global economy and removes most, but not all tariffs and sets new rules for digital trade and the treatment of state-owned enterprises.
Why has it stalled? The TPP still needs to be ratified by parliaments in its member countries. President Barack Obama hopes to get it through the US Congress later this year but is facing stiff opposition, including from both presidential candidates.—————-Jeff Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, warned in May of the dangers of a raucous US presidential election and a rise of protectionism. “A transformational change in globalisation” was coming, he warned, and the way to respond, for GE at least, was a strategy of “localisation”, which in many cases would mean a shift away from US-based manufacturing.Emma Marcegaglia, the chairman of Eni, Italy’s largest listed entity, as well as the president of BusinessEurope, argues that if opponents of globalisation manage to stop trade deals like the TPP or the TTIP they risk killing prospects for the very growth that many major economies need.“If we don’t fight this wave of protectionism we will have less growth and less jobs,” she says.Yet the backlash against globalisation has also forced some of its strongest proponents to acknowledge that it has had painful collateral damage, particularly for manufacturing-dependent communities in the US and Europe that have suffered as a result of competition from China, and the low-skilled workers that have been left behind.Addressing the UN on Tuesday, Mr Obama called for a “course correction” in the march to global integration.Too often, he said, “those trumpeting the benefits of globalisation” had ignored inequality and other real problems, leaving room for “alternative visions” ranging from “crude populism” to “religious fundamentalism” to take advantage of a very real dissatisfaction among citizens.He also, however, hailed the power of globalisation to reduce poverty and warned against protectionism.“The acceleration of travel and technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain — makes it self-defeating ultimately for those who seek to reverse this progress,” he said. “Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.”—————-Controversial deals 2: TTIPWhat is it? The EU and US launched negotiations on what could be the largest regional trade deal in history, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, in 2013.
Why has it stalled? The TTIP has faced increasing political opposition in Europe based on concerns over everything from different rules on food safety to its inclusion of an international investment dispute resolution mechanism that opponents claim would give US companies special rights to sue EU member governments and block environmental and other regulations.—————-Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, has also been among those calling for more to be done to help those left behind by globalisation. In the US she has provocatively urged a policy shift to “redistribution” — including higher taxes on the rich, more focus on education and job training and even an increase in the federal minimum wage.“What we need is a globalisation that works for all,” she said this month.The shift in rhetoric resonates with Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize for economics. In research published last year, the Princeton economist and his wife, Anne Case, documented an alarming surge in deaths among poorly-educated middle-aged white men in the US largely due to suicides and drug overdoses. One explanation lay in the rising economic insecurity in parts of the country hit by losses of jobs to automation and globalisation, they suggested.Mr Deaton remains a staunch defender of globalisation’s benefits. “What is crazy is that some of the opponents of globalisation — including some people that ought to know better — forget that a billion people have come out of poverty largely because of globalisation,” he says.But he also argues that economists and other advocates have a moral responsibility to no longer ignore those left behind. “What is happening right now is a very sharp kick in the shins to tell us that you are not entitled to do that,” he says.There are also those who argue for a radical rethink — and who view the sort of mea culpas offered by Mr Obama and Ms Lagarde with scepticism.In his 2011 book The Globalisation Paradox, Dani Rodrik, a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, offered what he called the “fundamental political ‘trilemma’ of the world economy: we cannot simultaneously pursue democracy, national determination and economic globalisation”.Today, Mr Rodrik argues his point is being made for him by volatile politics. And yet, he says, technocrats like Ms Lagarde still miss the bigger picture by continuing to push for trade agreements and ever more open economies despite the protests.“The main constraint on the global economy right now is not that it is not sufficiently open. It’s very open. The main constraint is really that the system lacks legitimacy,” he says.Amid such debates the drive to defend the cause of free trade is creating unusual political alliances. In a meeting last week to promote TPP, Mr Obama was joined at the White House by John Kasich, the former Republican presidential candidate, and business executives including Michael Bloomberg and IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty.Mr Bloomberg and Tom Donohue, the long-time president of the US Chamber of Commerce, lambasted both Mr Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for opposing the TPP, pointing out that international trade had benefited Americans for decades by bringing down the cost of consumer goods.“When was the last time you heard a candidate say you ought to pay more for groceries and underwear?” they wrote before the White House meeting.Also lining up improbably with Mr Obama are political arch-enemies such as Charles and David Koch, the billionaires who have spent millions opposing the president’s agenda over the past eight years.The Koch brothers have pointedly refused to back Mr Trump, in part due to the businessman’s protectionist trade rhetoric. This year their fire is instead aimed at congressional races and ensuring opponents of “economic freedom” do not make gains, says Tim Phillips, president for Americans for Prosperity, their political vehicle.They are also trying to ensure that after its flirtation with Mr Trump the Republican party returns to its pro-market roots by opening a special “leadership academy” for activists and candidates that includes lectures on the benefits of free trade. “It is easy to demagogue free trade and it is easy to point to where there are problems. We are going to point out what the virtues are,” Mr Phillips says.—————-Controversial deals 3: CetaWhat is it? The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement has been negotiated between the EU and Canada and aims remove tariffs and other obstacles to trade.
Why has it stalled? Opponents in both Europe and the US see the CETA as a proxy for the much larger TTIP and object to its inclusion of a controversial mechanism to resolve investment dispute that they argue gives too much power to international corporations.—————-The case for trade and the TPP has largely been won in Nebraska, a proud farm state that sends beef and soybeans around the world.“We are the 38th largest state, population-wise, but we’re the fourth-largest agricultural exporter. So you don’t have to study economics very long to figure out that we have to look at markets outside the borders of the United States,” says Greg Ibach, director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.Barb Cooksley, a fourth-generation rancher who is president of the Nebraska Cattlemen Association, says TPP would provide a badly needed boost at a time of rising international competition and lower prices. A recent trade agreement between Australia and Japan, which gives Australian producers easier access to the Japanese market, is costing US exporters $400,000 per day, she says.But times have been tough for many Nebraskan farmers as a result of the collapse in commodity prices. For that reason Mr Ibach says the tough-on-trade message of candidates like Mr Trump is appealing to many in farm country.An overwhelmingly Republican state, Nebraska last voted for a Democrat for president in 1964. Although Mr Obama won a lone electoral college vote in the second district in 2008 and Mrs Clinton campaigned with Mr Buffett in Omaha this summer, there are few signs Mr Trump will lose the state.Mrs Cooksley’s conservative loyalties are overwhelming her pro-trade economic beliefs. “Who am I voting for? I’m voting for Donald Trump,” she says.That is in part because she hopes that Mr Trump will change his policies on trade. “I feel there’s an education cure there,” she says. “He is a businessman. If we can show him how this [the TPP] is good business for the nation maybe we can convince him.”1 1944 More than 700 delegates from 44 countries gather at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to hash out the terms of a postwar economic order2 1948 The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade takes effect, lowering more than 45,000 tariffs.

However, core organic growth fell 2 per cent during the period and the company said it now expects like for like sales growth for the year to come in at around 1 per cent, down from its previous guidance of 1-2 per cent.Still net income was up more than 7 per cent at $1.28bn, or $1.66 per diluted share. This topped market forecast of $1.27bn and $1.64 a share.Honeywell is boosting the bottom of its full year guidance by five cents to $6.60 a share and keeping the top range figure at $6.70. However revenue forecast for the year was lowered from $40.3bn-$40.9bn to $40-$40.6bn.Much of Honeywell’s acquisitions have been concentrated in its “automation and control solutions division”, which produces a range of alarms and safety systems to protect people and machinery from pests such as fires.The deals helped the division surpass aerospace as the company’s biggest unit by sales during the quarter after growing more than 9 per cent to $3.8bn.Growth of the division has prompted Honeywell to split the business into two new segments: home and building technologies and safety and productivity solutions.Shares in Honeywell, up 14.6 per cent so far this year, fell 1 per cent in pre-market trading.

After that, he will begin a five-year consulting and non-compete agreement with Honeywell.The succession at Honeywell comes less than four months after the company abandoned its $90bn attempt to takeover United Technologies, a US aerospace maker, that would have created a group with combined annual sales of $97bn.Despite the failed bid, Mr Cote was known for his disciplined leadership. Annual revenues rose from $22bn when Mr Cote became CEO in 2002, to almost $39bn in 2015, according to Bloomberg data.The shares, which have risen 12 per cent over the past 12 months, were little changed in after hours trading in New York.

The transaction will create added value for our shareowners, who will receive AdvanSix shares tax-free in addition to the Honeywell shares they already own.
46;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-04-22T11:22:04Z;Honeywell lifts guidance after strong Q1;;US industrial giant Honeywell glided past first quarter earnings forecasts and has lifted its full year guidance after strong performance from its aerospace and residential businesses.Honeywell’s first quarter sales rose 3 per cent to $9.52bn, topping analyst forecasts of $9.37bn. This was driven by 1 per cent organic growth, with the rest coming from acquisitions.Last month Honeywell’s $90bn cash-and-shares bid for United Technologies failed, after which chief executive Dave Cote reassured investors “No, I have not lost my mind.”The company has lifted its full year profit guidance to $6.55-$6.70 per share, up from $6.45-$6.70 previously.First quarter earnings per share climbed 9 per cent to $1.53, which Mr Cote described as “a strong start to 2016”.Sales in the aerospace division rose 3 per cent to $3.71bn, while the “automation and control solutions division”, which produces a range of alarms and safety systems to protect people and machinery from pests such as fires, racked up a 13 per cent rise in sales to $3.68bn.The company said it “opportunistically” bought back $1bn of its own shares during the quarter.Mr Cote said:Looking ahead, our message and our planning will not change. We will support growth where there are opportunities to drive outperformance, be cautious in our sales planning, plan costs and spending conservatively, and continue to support the seed planting for new products, services, geographies, and process improvements that allow us to perform well now and in the future.
47;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-03-29T11:21:00Z;Closure of Carrier furnace plant in Indianapolis fuels populist fire;Mexico relocation has become emblem of working-class election anger;When Julie Meadows talks about the impending closure of her workplace, the Carrier furnace factory on the edge of Indianapolis, her anger gives way to something stronger — fear.Ms Meadows, 40, who has worked 12 years at the factory, was one of 1,400 workers told on February 10 that the factory’s work would be moved gradually over the next few years to Monterrey, Mexico. Final closure will come in 2019.The decision has come to symbolise the plight of US manufacturing ever since a worker posted a compelling YouTube video showing a manager informing furious workers about the decision. The decision is one of scores made by big US companies in recent years to shift jobs to low-cost locations, particularly Mexico, to exploit lower wage rates.Donald Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, has made the Carrier workers’ plight a staple of his stump speech, promising to reverse Carrier’s decision by imposing hefty tariffs on imports from Mexico.Indiana holds a primary on May 3, but Ms Meadows’ concerns are more immediate. Sitting in the headquarters of United Steelworkers’ local 1999, the workers’ union branch, she says she expects five or six colleagues to lose their homes after the furnace plant closes.Any future jobs they can find are likely to pay as little as half the $20-an-hour or more that many earn at Carrier. Equally importantly, such jobs are likely to offer far worse healthcare benefits.“They’re going to have to work three or four jobs to make up what they’re making at Carrier,” Ms Meadows says. “I’m just worried about the single moms, the single dads, the ones that are sick that need their medication that are going to lose it.”The fear and insecurity haunting Ms Meadows and others at the local 1999 hall helps to explain the wave of populist anger among working people — especially the white working class — that has marked the presidential election.The battle for the US presidency has shifted into a new gear as caucuses and primary elections are held state by state until JuneThe relatively healthy condition of Indiana’s economy — it has an unemployment rate of only 4.6 per cent — provides little comfort, since wages are stagnant or falling.“[Self-styled Socialist Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie] Sanders on the left and Trump on the right are tapping into a pretty substantial discontent among working people,” says Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank.The populist politicians stand out from the US political mainstream by promising to help reverse the outsourcing trend.Carol Rogers, deputy director of Indiana University’s Business Research Center, thinks, like most other academic economists, that the only realistic option is to capture new investment to replace jobs that move away.You’re destroying people’s lives in an effort to make a couple more dollars“It’s an event that will continue to occur, not just in Indianapolis or the US but everywhere,” Ms Rogers says of the Carrier decision.United Technologies, Carrier’s parent, has indicated it will seek to make more closures. At an investor day on March 10, UTC’s chief financial officer touted the possibility of moving more of the company’s manufacturing from high-cost countries to lower-cost ones as an “opportunity”.Greg Hayes, the company’s chief executive, defended the Carrier decision as hard but inevitable, while stressing the company was offering funding for college degrees or other retraining for workers.“The fact was the supply chain had moved to Mexico, along with about half the competition over the last few years,” he said.But the closure’s apparent inevitability provides little comfort to those gathered at the union hall. Ms Meadows says she was supporting Mr Trump even before the closure decision. Chuck Jones, the union local’s president, says he has supported Mr Sanders for many years.Workers and officials express astonishment that United Technologies, which recorded net income of $7.61bn on $56.1bn sales for 2015, is shutting the plant to make itself more profitable.“It doesn’t really seem like an appropriate move,” Daniel Byrd, the senior union representative among the employees, said. “You’re destroying people’s lives in an effort to make a couple more dollars.”Executives at United Technologies and other big companies nevertheless feel obliged to pursue ever-greater efficiencies to head off the risk that activist investors or rivals will jettison them in favour of tougher replacements.The pressures on United Technologies’ management became clear a few days after the Carrier closure announcement when Honeywell, an industrial rival, announced a since-abandoned $90bn takeover offer for UTC. Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive, called United Technologies’ businesses “undermanaged assets”.There is little inclination at the union hall to see such issues from the bosses’ point of view. Mr Jones bristles at the idea that he might feel some understanding for the predicament of Mr Hayes and other senior executives.“It’s just wrong,” he says.
48;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-03-23T09:19:44Z;Airlines complain to Brussels over parts and maintenance contracts;Industry lobbies European Commission over manufacturers’ demands to use original components;Airlines have lodged a formal complaint with European regulators over the $60bn market for spares and repairs on the world’s fleet of 24,000 aircraft, as EU investigators intensify their preliminary inquiry into whether carriers are being forced to accept anti-competitive maintenance contracts.Iata, the airline industry lobby group, last week sent a letter to the European Commission listing grievances such as requirements by engine and component manufacturers to use only their spare parts for repairs.Meanwhile, Brussels is demanding further information from aircraft suppliers in a sign that it is deepening its informal inquiry into the workings of the maintenance and repair market. No formal investigation has yet been launched.The preliminary probe, first revealed by the Financial Times last year, is focused on maintenance support for the CFM56 turbine and Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB engines, as well for components including auxiliary power systems made by Honeywell.Safran, the French engine maker, and CFM, its joint venture with General Electric of the US, are among those to have received a follow-up letter to the original questionnaire sent to dozens of suppliers last autumn. Rolls-Royce and Honeywell said they had not as yet received a second request for information.The rising costs of aircraft maintenance have been roundly attacked by airline chiefs at British Airways, Air France, Ryanair and Lufthansa. Carriers complain that some original equipment suppliers are withholding repair information from qualified third-party maintenance shops, which they say limits competition and pushes up prices. They want the commission to set limits on what equipment suppliers can define as intellectual property, which would open up the maintenance market to a wider range of suppliers.However, suppliers such as engine manufacturers rely on the lucrative aftersales service market for their profits. New engines are often sold at a loss, with the returns made on long-term service contracts. Attempts to disrupt this model could force airlines into bigger upfront expenditure, say industry experts. Components suppliers are also looking to tap into the higher margin aftersales service market to make up for demands from aircraft makers that they take on a greater share of the risk in new aircraft programmes.The trend to limit the choice of engine and other components on new aircraft programmes has given added urgency to airlines’ complaints.“When airlines are negotiating with suppliers they do not have the leverage they would have in a normal competitive situation,” said a person with knowledge of the situation. “Are manufacturers right to say that airlines have to buy spare parts from them in perpetuity?”The commission refused to comment beyond confirming that it is “closely monitoring competitive conditions as regards maintenance of engines and components for large commercial aircraft”. Iata confirmed it had lodged a formal complaint.The maintenance, repair and overhaul market is set for robust growth over the next decade thanks to the unprecedented number of new generation aircraft coming into service. Aerospace consultancies such as ICF International and Technavio estimate the market will grow from $60bn this year to more than $80bn by 2025.Maintaining and repairing an aircraft accounts for roughly 10-13 per cent of an airline’s operating costs and the complex job of servicing the roughly 30,000 components on an aircraft is often outsourced to a third party.

Mr Trump, the Republican frontrunner, has vowed there will be no such closures if he becomes president.Mr Hayes insisted that the decision to close the Indianapolis plant with the loss of 1,400 jobs and another nearby site with the loss of 700 jobs was “one of the hardest decisions” the company had made. It plans to move the work to Monterrey starting next year and finishing in 2019.“The fact was the supply chain had moved to Mexico, along with about half the competition over the past few years,” Mr Hayes said.He appealed to politicians to avoid erecting new trade barriers to avoid such moves, saying they would do workers more harm than good. UTC exported about $10bn of goods annually from the US and imported far less, he added.“If you ever thought about putting trade barriers up, it’s going to hurt the American worker a lot more than it would protect him,” he said.Nevertheless, Mr Hayes was clear that there was potential for more of the industrial conglomerate’s work to leave the US for cheaper locations. “There are one or two [factories] perhaps,” he said.Analysts believe much of the appeal of Mr Trump and Bernie Sanders, the “Democratic Socialist” mounting a strong challenge for the Democratic nomination, stems from their tapping into worker resentment over issues such as outsourcing.Defending UTC’s record, Mr Hayes pointed out that its Otis elevator division moved some production in 2012 back from Mexico to South Carolina.Its Pratt & Whitney aero engine business was in the process of investing billions of dollars in facilities in Connecticut and Florida to manufacture its revolutionary Geared Turbofan jet engine, Mr Hayes added.“The fact is we have a great, skilled workforce,” he said. “Expensive — but high-tech, high value-added work like the jet engine you can afford to do the work in higher-cost locations.”On February 23, 12 days after the video of the Carrier announcement was filmed, it emerged that Honeywell, UTC’s industrial rival, had approached UTC about a $90bn cash-and-shares takeover. UTC rejected the approach, saying that regulatory issues made a deal impossible.If you ever thought about putting trade barriers up, it’s going to hurt the American worker a lot more than it would protect himHowever, Mr Hayes denied that the pressure of a potential takeover or pressure from activist investors had inspired decisions such as the Indianapolis closure.“Being cost focused is always a part of UTC,” he said. “We’re always looking to be cost competitive.”During the investor meeting, Akhil Johri, chief financial officer, said the company still had 50 per cent of its manufacturing capacity in high-cost locations.“So there’s an opportunity to drive cost through relocation to lower-cost locations,” he said.Ahead of the meeting, UTC had reaffirmed its projections for full-year adjusted earnings per share — excluding restructuring and other one-off costs — of $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56bn to $58bn.
50;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-03-02T18:32:01Z;Honeywell chief reassures investors on sanity over failed UTC bid;Dave Cote seeks to draw line under unsuccessful $90bn pursuit of United Technologies;Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive, has sought to draw a line under the company’s unsuccessful pursuit of United Technologies by reassuring investors that he had not lost his mind.Honeywell abandoned the $90bn cash-and-shares bid on Tuesday, just eight days after it first became public.There has been criticism that Mr Cote, 63, was seeking a landmark deal whose implementation would keep him in his post after Honeywell’s normal retirement age of 65.But at a planned company investor day on Wednesday, he said: “No, I have not lost my mind. No, I’m not looking to stay in this job forever and eternalise the position.”Honeywell had purely seen the deal as an opportunity to “make a lot of money” for both companies’ shareholders. “We really thought this would work very well,” Mr Cote said.He acknowledged, however, that UTC, which competes in many of the same markets as Honeywell, had not been interested.UTC said regulatory concerns— particularly over the potentially combined company’s power as a supplier to commercial jet manufacturers — meant a deal was not feasible.“If they’re not interested and they’re not willing, we have plenty of other stuff to do,” Mr Cote said.Honeywell had already said that it was expecting earnings per share this year to grow by 6-10 per cent on its 2015 results. It also said it expected strong sales growth — of 4-5 per cent — in 2017.The investor day stressed the company’s strategy of using its Honeywell operating system to manage all of its businesses and its strong position in emerging markets, especially ChinaMr Cote was at pains, meanwhile, to stress that the United Technologies approach did not mean Honeywell had an “elephant gun” and was out seeking another big takeover deal.“This was a unique opportunity at a unique point in time, with undermanaged assets at a good price that we really thought we could do something with,” he said.He also defended his personal sale of $36.2m in Honeywell shares three days before he presented the proposed deal to Greg Hayes, UTC’s chief executive.The sale had been set up to take place at the end of a year-long lock-up period after executives exercised options, Mr Cote said. The transaction had represented only 10 per cent of his total holdings.The Honeywell chief rejected UTC’s objections to the deal and said they had misconstrued how competition regulators treated the market to supply components to aircraft makers.Honeywell’s shares were up 0.1 per cent at midday in New York, at $105.97.
51;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-03-01T17:55:16Z;Honeywell abandons $90bn pursuit of United Technologies;Aerospace group criticises rival for unwillingness to negotiate;Honeywell launched a fresh round of criticism of United Technologies on Tuesday as it scrapped its proposed $90bn offer for its rival, citing its unwillingness to engage in negotiations.The US aerospace supplier said it strongly disagreed with UTC’s characterisation of the regulatory and customer risks associated with a deal, which would have created a combined group with annual sales of about $97bn.The decision not to pursue a takeover suggests Honeywell has been unable to convince UTC shareholders to push management into resuming talks despite going public with its terms.On Friday, Dave Cote, Honeywell chief executive, appealed directly to investors by publishing a February 19 presentation he had made to Greg Hayes, his counterpart at UTC, about the structure and logic of a potential deal.Since talks between the two companies became public eight days ago, UTC has insisted that regulators would never permit such a combination to go through. The two companies would have faced especially formidable barriers in the aerospace components sector, where they are the biggest suppliers in many fields.However, it remains to be seen whether Honeywell’s overture will prompt another approach for UTC or pressure for a break-up of the company, whose businesses are grouped around building systems and aerospace.A research note from RBC Capital Markets said it would prove impossible for UTC to “put the genie back in the bottle”.“Although Honeywell has backed off here, we still think that they have put [UTC] ‘in play’ and that this will ultimately be a benefit for [UTC’s] share price and valuation,” it wrote.Honeywell had argued that the overlaps between the businesses were smaller than they appeared, and that the regulatory issues were manageable. It reiterated that point in its statement on Tuesday, saying: “We remain confident that the regulatory process would not have presented a material obstacle to a transaction.”Although Honeywell has backed off here, we still think that they have put UTC ‘in play’It added that UTC’s view had changed since it originally approached Honeywell about a possible transaction in April last year as well as on a previously undisclosed occasion in May 2011.“In our approach to their chairman and their CEO on February 19 2016, we had hoped to continue amicable and quiet discussions of a combination,” Honeywell said.Mr Cote said Honeywell had made a “full and fair offer” that would have benefited both sets of shareholders.But he added that continuing to try to negotiate with an unwilling partner was “inconsistent with our disciplined acquisition process”.UTC said Honeywell’s decision not to pursue a strategic combination was the appropriate outcome “given the strong regulatory obstacles, negative customer reaction and the potential for a protracted review process that would have destroyed shareholder value”.“Our outlook remains strong and our industry-leading franchises are well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth and create shareholder value well into the future,” it said.Mr Cote will now outline Honeywell’s strategy as a standalone company on Wednesday at a previously scheduled investor day. He said an independent Honeywell had a “terrific growth story”.Shares in Honeywell rose 4.5 per cent in New York trading to $105.87. UTC shares were down 1.6 per cent at $95.05.Honeywell also announced two small takeovers on Tuesday — the $123m purchase of RSI Video Technologies, a provider of video equipment for intrusion detection systems, and the purchase for an undisclosed sum of Movilizer, which produces equipment for simplifying co-ordination between remote workers.
52;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-03-01T14:24:14Z;Honeywell drops pursuit of UTC;;US manufacturer Honeywell is abandoning its pursuit of United Technologies after the company repeatedly rebuffed its advances.New Jersey-based Honeywell said on Tuesday that it would no longer pursue the deal because of UTC’s “unwillingness to engage in negotiations”.Honeywell, which is run by David Cote, had proposed a $90bn takeover with UTC shareholders receiving $42.63 a share in cash and 0.614 of Honeywell stock, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.But UTC cited “significant regulatory obstacles, customer concerns and valuation issues” as hurdles for such a transaction and said the move was an “opportunistic” takeover attempt that would “ultimately destroy shareholder value”.In Tuesday’s statement, Honeywell hit back stating that the regulatory process would not have been a hurdle and that UTC “felt the same way as we do when they approached us in May, 2011 and in April, 2015″. Mr Cote said:Continuing to try to negotiate with an unwilling partner is inconsistent with our disciplined acquisition process.We have a terrific growth story for standalone Honeywell that we look forward to sharing at our Investor Day on March 2.Shares in UTC declined more than 4 per cent in pre-market trading.
53;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-02-26T20:16:15Z;Honeywell and UTC bickering escalates;Target hits back after details of $90bn cash-and-stock offer are published;A week of bickering over Honeywell’s $90bn cash-and-stock offer for United Technologies escalated on Friday when the target accused Honeywell of trying to execute a “leveraged buyout using UTC’s own balance sheet”.The comments by UTC came after Honeywell tried to put pressure on its board and go over members’ heads to shareholders by disclosing details of the terms of its rejected offer for the rival industrial group. Honeywell’s disclosure was a clear effort to entice investors, a person familiar with the matter said.On Friday UTC said Honeywell still had no solution to regulatory problems the deal would face, and criticised the financial terms.Greg Hayes, UTC chief executive, wrote to shareholders that his company had discussed a combination with Honeywell “on-and-off for years” to determine if there was a way to create shareholder value.The letter adds: “After the exploratory discussions last spring it became clear that the regulatory environment had shifted dramatically during the course of 2015.”The company had concluded after legal advice that regulators would block a deal, the letter says.“Even if it were possible to complete a transaction, the regulatory delay, required divestitures, and customer concerns and concessions would ultimately destroy shareholder value far beyond any synergies.”The reaction appeared for the time being to dash Honeywell’s hopes of softening the UTC board’s opposition.Honeywell’s presentation contains details of the offer made to UTC on February 19, comprising $42.63 in cash and 0.614 of a Honeywell share. A combined group would have around $97bn in annual sales and could cut costs of about $3.5bn annually, Honeywell said.Cai von Rumohr, an analyst for Cowen and Company, said the release put pressure on UTC’s management. However, the pitch’s “glaring weakness” was that nowhere did it mention “antitrust”.“Usually, an effective pitch will go right to the point everybody’s concerned about,” Mr von Rumohr said.Documents published alongside Mr Hayes’ letter go into substantial detail about the significant overlap between the two companies’ businesses.In aerospace, the documents say, overlaps include the markets for small and medium aircraft engines, auxiliary power units, air management systems and seven other product lines.They point out that all four of the world’s biggest manufacturers of civilian jets — Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer — have said they oppose a combination.“Given this level of customer opposition, which we predicted and indicated to Honeywell directly, we do not believe that even significant financial concessions could make them supportive of the proposed deal,” the documents say.UTC’s letter also says Honeywell’s proposal “grossly undervalues UTC and overstates potential synergies”.“Effectively Honeywell’s proposal is a leveraged buyout of UTC using UTC’s own strong balance sheet.”Even if it were possible to complete a transaction, the regulatory delay, required divestitures, and customer concerns … would ultimately destroy shareholder value far beyond any synergiesPeople familiar with the situation said it was unclear whether Honeywell would raise its offer. But they stressed that the New Jersey-based company was determined to get a deal done.Shares in UTC rose 1.2 per cent on publication of the details to $99.29 before closing at $97.66, while Honeywell shares closed 1.1 per cent lower at $103.02.It also emerged on Friday that Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive, sold $36.2m worth of the company’s shares on February 16, three days before he made the presentation to Mr Hayes. Chief executives are normally barred from dealing in their companies’ shares while they prepare for big unannounced deals.Honeywell declined to comment on the transactions, published in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.However, Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond law school in Virginia, said there were generally rules against such transactions at sensitive times. “I think it’s unusual,” he said.When releasing the details of the proposed deal, Honeywell said it had received “a number of inquiries from investors” and it was releasing the presentation “in order to help investors understand the proposal”.Honeywell had also contacted customers to reassure them about the benefits of a deal, one personal familiar with the situation said.The presentation lists a series of benefits for customers, including a merged group’s ability to use its combined research and development budget to produce components for a wider array of aircraft systems and products.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London
54;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-02-26T18:57:53Z;United Technologies: Honeywell ‘opportunistic’;;United Technologies has accused Honeywell of pursuing an “opportunistic” takeover attempt that would “ultimately destroy shareholder value” as its staff and customers waited for a likely quashing of the deal by US competition authorities.The US manufacturer and defence contractor said on Friday that its executives had devoted “significant” time to analyse the regulatory obstacles and taken advice from three law firms.Its board has concluded that:The value destruction from the cloud of uncertainty hanging over our businesses, employees and customers during an extended review period would be significant, and, under Honeywell’s proposed construct, borne much more heavily by United Technologies and our shareowners.The language is the toughest yet from United Technologies, and comes hours after Honeywell released the details of a deal presented to United chief executive Gregory Hayes earlier this month.
55;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-02-26T18:45:43Z;Honeywell / UTC: show me the money;If group is so confident about its bid, it should offer a big break fee;Honeywell says that, if its proposed merger with United Technologies is consummated, management at the new company will consist of the “best athletes” from both. With the amount of fancy footwork needed to close a deal, consider the negotiations a tryout.This week both groups admitted to preliminary discussions about a combination. But UTC says after some reflection it withdrew because it did not believe a merger could be approved by regulators given the overlap in their aerospace operations. A very big customer, Airbus, confirmed this view.Honeywell’s acclaimed CEO David Cote — once reticent about big deals — is not relenting. On Friday Honeywell, in hopes of swaying UTC shareholders, released a presentation designed to bring its prey back to the table. For all the bullet points, logos and pie charts, the key page of the document is the last one detailing the maths of the cash-and-stock offer. The combined net income of $10bn is boosted by more than a tenth by anticipated cost savings. The augmented earnings are then capitalised using Honeywell’s already toppy earnings multiple. Voila: the total upside for UTC shareholders is more than 50 per cent.With negotiation, UTC shareholders could get still more. The UTC share price implied by Honeywell’s offer is just an 8 per cent premium to its 52-week high.Still, the maths come up short. Honeywell makes no mention of the one-time costs that will be accrued in achieving the synergies, which could run into the billions. It is also cavalier about the possibility that regulators will require big divestitures or even scuttle the merger. Perhaps Honeywell’s aggressive numbers will impress UTC shareholders, who have been unimpressed thus far. A number that would really get attention is the break-up fee Honeywell would be willing to pay should the deal fall apart. Given all its bluster, that figure should be nice and big.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
56;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-02-26T18:08:53Z;Honeywell chief executive does not give up easily;Dave Cote is pushing hard to take over UTC, to create a behemoth in the aero and building sectors;Dave Cote is clearly a man who does not give up easily.This week, it emerged that the chief executive of Honeywell had proposed one of the biggest industrial deals ever by making a $90bn approach to buy United Technologies.Such a takeover would create a behemoth for the supply of components to the aerospace and building industries, because both companies already have strong positions in these sectors.Greg Hayes, UTC’s chief executive, rebuffed Honeywell’s approach, saying on Tuesday that the deal “can’t happen” because of insurmountable regulatory obstacles. Then on Wednesday, Airbus and Boeing, two of the most important customers for both Honeywell and UTC, made plain they opposed the transaction.But Mr Cote, 63, is having none of it. On Friday, Honeywell put pressure on UTC to return to the negotiating table by publishing details of its takeover proposal - including the stipulation that Mr Cote would run the combined company.The curiosity is that the plan appears at odds with sceptical remarks about megadeals that Mr Cote made to Fortune magazine in 2012. “A big deal that goes bad can ruin a company,” he said then, although Honeywell insists he has never ruled out big transactions.There has been speculation that Mr Cote’s pitch for UTC is driven by a desire to pull off a landmark transaction before his retirement, but a friend counters this argument.“I don’t think he has any plans to ride off into the sunset immediately,” says the friend, who asks not to be named. “He just thought it was a great opportunity for Honeywell.”Mr Cote has won the right to have his judgments taken seriously. The Honeywell that he inherited in 2002 was still reeling from the European Commission’s unexpected blocking in 2001 of General Electric’s proposed takeover. But Honeywell has performed strongly in recent times.The company’s share price has risen 84 per cent over the past five years, against 43 per cent for GE and 18 per cent for UTC. Honeywell’s 12.4 per cent net margin for 2015 was by far the best among its big competitors.Mr Cote’s career has also been impressive given his modest upbringing in Suncook, New Hampshire, where his father ran a garage.“He’s not forgotten where he came from,” says the friend. “He has very few, if any, CEO airs.”He spent his early career at GE, where Fortune reported that he caught the eye of Jack Welch, then CEO. Mr Cote rose through various management positions, including head of GE’s appliances business in the late 1990s.He was appointed CEO of TRW, the car component supplier, in 1999, joining Honeywell as chief executive in 2002. He has since been an adviser to President George W Bush, and served on President Barack Obama’s national committee on fiscal responsibility and reform.His career has not been without controversy. Mr Cote was a director of JPMorgan Chase, and on the board’s risk policy committee, in 2012 — the year in which the bank was hit by billions of dollars of losses from the “London Whale” trading fiasco.In that year’s annual report, the bank described the episode as “extremely embarrassing,” and said it “had opened us up to severe criticism”. Mr Cote stood down from the board in July 2013, shortly after large numbers of shareholders had objected to his reappointment.Has Mr Cote now over-reached himself by attempting a takeover of UTC? Even if he can win over his reluctant target, antitrust regulators could well block any such combination, because of the power the enlarged company, or demand substantial remedies.One thing is for sure: Mr Cote will need all his apparent tenacity to pull this deal off.Additional reporting by Ben McLannahan

58;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-02-25T00:40:32Z;Airbus opposes any attempt to revive Honeywell-UTC deal;Boeing also signals it is against the two aerospace suppliers combining;Airbus and rival aerospace groups on Wednesday signalled their opposition to a merger between Honeywell and United Technologies, key suppliers to the aircraft makers, in moves that greatly reduce the chances of the $90bn deal being revived.Honeywell is pushing for merger talks to restart after rejecting UTC’s claim that a combination of the two aerospace suppliers would face insurmountable regulatory obstacles. It emerged on Monday that the two companies have held on-off discussions about a combination, but that UTC rebuffed Honeywell’s most recent approach.Tom Enders, Airbus chief executive, waded into the matter on Wednesday by insisting that, whatever the regulatory issues, a merger of two of the company’s top 20 suppliers would pose problems for the aircraft maker.“I do not see that such a combination would be in the interests of Airbus,” he told the Financial Times.Mr Ender’s comments were reinforced by Boeing, Airbus’ US rival.“Healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important to Boeing and our commercial and military customers . . . we would anticipate taking a very close look at the potential impact on us and our customers of a Honeywell-UTC merger or acquisition,” said Boeing.And Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier told the FT that it would also object to any merger, reflecting widespread industry unease over the dominance such an enlarged supplier would have and the erosion of competition.Mr Enders said earlier that neither Honeywell nor UTC had sounded out Airbus on the possible merger.But he indicated that UTC understood Airbus’s concerns. “I am under the impression that the UTC leadership shares [my] assessment,” he said.Airbus buys roughly €4bn worth of components, systems and services from UTC each year, and the owner of Pratt & Whitney, the engine maker, is the European aerospace group’s number one supplier.Honeywell ranks 18th and supplies, among other things, wheels, brakes and air conditioning systems, worth about €300m each year.Suppliers are coming under pressure from the two big aircraft makers to bring down costs while stepping up production.However, combining Honeywell and UTC would give the enlarged company unrivalled dominance in several key areas of aerospace products, such as air conditioning systems, said one person familiar with the situation.Announcing Airbus’s 2015 results, Mr Enders said the robustness of the group’s supply chain was a priority for 2016 — a year when it begins to accelerate production of its newest generation of aircraft such as the A350 long-range jet.However, the group was so confident in its prospects that it was reversing a cut in production of its older A330 wide-body jet.Mr Enders said strong orders for the A330 meant that the production rate per month could go back to seven aircraft in 2017, just a year after it was cut to six.There was some caution from Mr Enders on a revamped version of its A320 narrow-body jet, the group’s most popular aircraft.Problems with the Pratt & Whitney engine have led to delays and Airbus was having to pull forward deliveries of the existing A320 to compensate.Mr Enders said he expected the engine troubles on the A320neo — the name of the revamped version — to be overcome by the summer.“I am confident with the contingency plans we have put in place,” he said, “and confident we can deal with the temporary delay.”Finally Mr Enders warned over the risk of yet more charges for Airbus’s troubled A400M military transport programme.Airbus reported operating profit of €4.1bn for 2015, up 2 per cent compared to 2014. Sales rose 6 per cent to €64.5bn.The group proposed raising its dividend 8 per cent to €1.30 per share.Airbus expects “stable” earnings in 2016 before one-off charges, and steady cash flow.Airbus is aiming to deliver more than 650 passenger jets this year, up from 635 in 2015.Robert Stallard, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the increase in A330 production was good news. “Given that each A330 makes roughly €20m in profit, this would represent about 5 per cent more earnings,” he added.
59;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T02:00:22+0000;Honeywell still open to deal despite UTC’s regulatory concerns;Industrial conglomerate says it does not see a ‘material obstacle to a transaction’;Honeywell has insisted that regulatory obstacles need not prevent it from merging with United Technologies, in a spirited riposte that suggests it remains committed to pursuing the potential $90bn transaction.Honeywell made its first official comments on the possible deal in a statement after Tuesday’s close of trading in New York, more than 24 hours after news broke of the talks between the two companies.It was responding to UTC’s insistence in a statement on Monday evening and in a television appearance on Tuesday by Greg Hayes, UTC’s chief executive, that regulators would so clearly block the transaction that it was not worth pursuing.A merged Honeywell-UTC would have annual sales of more than $100bn a year. Honeywell’s offer, worth about $108 a share, would value UTC at about $90bn.The merged company would have a powerful position as a supplier of components to aerospace companies, particularly builders of commercial passenger aircraft and business jets. UTC has said that opposition from manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus would doom the deal.Honeywell confirmed that it had “engaged in discussions” with UTC over the past year over a “possible business combination”. It did not see the “regulatory process” as a “material obstacle to a transaction”, it said.“The value creation from a combination is significant, including the benefits of $3.5bn in annualised cost synergies,” it added, in the first estimate from either company of a deal’s potential financial benefits.“In fact, a combination would benefit our customers and enhance our ability to offer a more comprehensive and compelling suite of technologies to serve their needs,” the company said.Honeywell laid out no clear plans for pursuing a transaction in spite of UTC management’s resistance. But it said it would not pursue a transaction that was not in the best interests of shareholders.“Regardless of whether a transaction occurs, we are highly confident in our long-term growth prospects, our ability to create shareowner value, and our strong investment grade balance sheet,” the company said.At the heart of the dispute between the two companies are two different versions of why the talks over a potential transaction had broken down. UTC insists that it rebuffed Honeywell because of the regulatory concerns. People familiar with the matter on Honeywell’s side say that the sticking point was “social” — whether Honeywell’s or UTC’s executives would run a merged company.UTC had no immediate response to Honeywell’s statement.Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive, appears determined, according to people involved, to secure a transaction that would cement his legacy at Honeywell, whose share price has risen nearly 90 per cent over the past five years. UTC’s shares, by contrast, are up only about 13 per cent over the same period.UTC’s shares, which slipped 0.8 per cent to $91.60 during normal trading on news of its reluctance to consider a deal, were unchanged in after-market trading. Shares in Honeywell were down 0.9 per cent in normal trading at $103.64 and were also unchanged in after-market trading.
60;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
61;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T02:00:22+0000;Antitrust issues kill possibility of Honeywell-UTC deal;Combined company would have had powerful positions in aerospace and building industries;When the new 737 Max passenger jet took off for its maiden flight last month into the rainy skies above Seattle, only one company — Boeing, the aircraft’s manufacturer — had its name on the side of the jetliner. But the flight was also an important cause for celebration for two other manufacturers.Honeywell, one of the US’s biggest industrial conglomerates, had what it called a “full complement” of electronic and mechanical systems, including new equipment for supplying cabin air, on the revamped version of the popular short-haul jet. UTC Aerospace Systems, part of United Technologies, another big US conglomerate, also supplied key components for the jet, including the electric power system, wheels and brakes.The high proportion of components on both the 737 Max and nearly every other passenger jet that comes from either UTC or Honeywell appears to have played a decisive role in prompting the former company to rebuff a merger approach from the latter.Honeywell offered $108 per share to take over UTC, valuing the target at about $90bn, according to people familiar with the matter. That represents a 22 per cent premium to Friday’s closing share price.A combination would have created an industrial giant with more than $100bn annual sales, with leading positions in aerospace components and building control systems.But, appearing on Tuesday on CNBC, the financial television channel, Greg Hayes, UTC’s chief executive, elaborated on what the company had said in a statement on Monday — that regulatory problems would make a deal impossible.“What became very apparent to us is that it just can’t happen, can’t happen from a regulatory standpoint, from a customer standpoint,” he said.Honeywell’s approach came, according to people familiar with the matter, at the end of a year-long process that started with an inquiry from Mr Hayes about the possibility of his company’s launching a takeover bid.The decision to end the latest talks surprised Honeywell, according to people familiar with the situation, as they claim UTC’s management had convinced those involved about the viability of a deal. Honeywell’s advisers had determined that the overlap in sales between the two companies was less than 5 per cent of total sales.Yet it is hard to imagine under current circumstances how, short of making a hostile bid for UTC, Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive, can hope to overcome his target’s adamant rejection of a deal.One person familiar with UTC’s thinking says that, for many Boeing and Airbus aircraft, the combined company would have controlled “everything inside the plane, from the nose to the tail”. The person could have added that, on some A320 Neos — Airbus’s competitor to the 737 Max — UTC’s role stretches outside the aircraft. Airlines can order a version of that jet equipped with the geared turbofan engine made by UTC’s Pratt & Whitney subsidiary.“You just can’t get this deal done,” Mr Hayes told CNBC. “As much as it may make sense in a headline, there’s just no way to get it done.”However, people close to Honeywell say that the bigger stumbling block to a deal was the issue of who would lead the combined company’s management. Under the last proposal, Mr Cote would have been chief executive, pushing aside Mr Hayes, these people add.The deal’s fate reflects the increasing concentration of the US’s once-sprawling big industrial conglomerates. While many companies used to spread their corporate bets across multiple industries, a struggle over the past few years to achieve better returns has led to consolidation.One area where this has happened is aerospace, where component suppliers are now capitalising on the record order backlogs for jets accumulated by Airbus and Boeing.UTC built up UTC Aerospace Systems through the $4bn takeover of Sundstrand Corporation in 1999 and the $16.5bn acquisition of Goodrich in 2011. The current Honeywell originated in Allied Signal’s 1999 takeover of Honeywell, after which it adopted the target’s name.Richard Aboulafia, analyst at the Teal Group, says that, even as the aerospace industry took its current shape — with “super-mezzanine” contractors that had far more power — there were worries about the effects.“Everybody said these super-mezzanine contractors would have a stranglehold over aircraft design and production,” he adds.Yet, while the aircraft manufacturers have managed to retain the whip hand in their relations with suppliers so far, few industry observers believe manufacturers — or regulators — would have taken a deal as audacious as the one planned calmly.“A Honeywell-UTC combination would create a colossus in a wide range of parts and components for aircraft that inevitably would attract the attention of competition regulators,” says Loren Thompson, analyst at the Lexington Institute.The likelihood, according to Mr Aboulafia, is that even if the deal went ahead, manufacturers would seek to trim the behemoth’s power through their own procurement processes. He points out that, after UTC’s takeover of Goodrich gave it a powerful position in some forms of aircraft landing gear, Boeing decided to award a contract for such equipment on its 777X wide-body jet to Canada’s Héroux-Devtek. The company had never before built a wide-body jet’s landing gear.The risk that a combined Honeywell-UTC could face such action and the prospect that an attempted deal could face two years of regulatory battles have left few observers optimistic that Mr Cote could successfully revisit the mooted transaction.There are, however, smaller companies that compete less in aerospace that could still provide Mr Cote with a deal to bookend a successful career. Observers suggest he might have more success with less contentious targets such as Ireland’s Eaton Corporation or Switzerland’s ABB. Honeywell declined to comment.
62;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Honeywell: gone fishing;Big M&A is an odd strategy for a company built on steady efficiency gains;"A big deal that goes bad can ruin a company — words attributed to David Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell International and former commercial cod fisherman. He must have been feeling confident, then, as the industrial company he has managed so masterfully for nearly 15 years sought to reel in a whale. On Monday, fellow industrial conglomerate United Technologies confirmed reports that it had held — and ended — talks with Honeywell about a combination.It was a risky gambit for Honeywell, a company whose 2000 sale to General Electric famously collapsed under regulatory scrutiny. And it was equally curious given that Mr Cote made Honeywell the envy of the sector through its towering profit margins, achieved without the distraction of any tricky M&A.Five years ago, Honeywell’s operating margin was just 9 per cent. By 2015, the figure had doubled. In vast companies such as these, organic revenue will only ever grow by GDP plus a bit. Absent acquisitions, that leaves efficiency gains as the only route to strong earnings growth. In the past five years, Honeywell shares have nearly doubled, versus a mere 14 per cent gain for United Technologies and a 44 per cent gain General Electric.But profit improvements can plateau; Honeywell says that this year operating margin will at best be up just half a percentage point. And hubris can creep in. United Technologies may be vulnerable; its longstanding CEO quit abruptly in 2014 and the shares are off a fifth since then. However, combining Honeywell’s own jet components business with United Technologies’ jet components and engines division would echo the ill-fated GE deal. Both also have building and climate controls units that either fit together well — or would worry competition authorities.Still, Mr Cote may yet keep searching for a capstone catch. More than a decade of sharp leadership could be undone with a single ego-boosting power play. But he already knows that.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
63;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-02-23T04:44:20Z;Honeywell and UTC held merger talks;Proposed cash and stock deal rebuffed on antitrust concerns;Honeywell and United Technologies, two leaders of the US industrial sector, have held talks about a potential merger that would create a group with annual sales in excess of $100bn.A person familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that Honeywell had been the driving force behind the discussions and that UTC had rebuffed its approach. It was unclear whether any talks were still under way.News of the talks, first reported by CNBC, sent UTC shares up 6.4 per cent to $93.87 on Monday. Honeywell shares fell 2.1 per cent to $105.02.Honeywell approached UTC, people familiar with the matter said. The two companies had talked to each other at various times for more than a year about a cash and stock combination, one person close to the situation said, although another cautioned that the talks were early stage.But the talks failed because UTC feared US and European competition watchdogs would block a deal. Honeywell and UTC declined to comment.Any deal between the pair would create a hugely powerful supplier to both the military and civilian aerospace sectors and a leader in controls for buildings and industrial facilities.A combined company’s aerospace business would centre on UTC’s Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine business, which is working on a potentially momentous breakthrough with its fuel-saving geared turbofan engine for narrow-body jets. Honeywell generated $15.2bn in revenue last year from its aerospace businesses, which manufacture navigation systems, lighting, cooling equipment and other components for commercial aircraft.There would also be considerable overlap between Honeywell’s automation and control solutions businesses and UTC’s climate controls and security business. Honeywell’s business focuses more sharply on controls for industrial processes, while UTC’s supplies equipment such as air conditioning for residential and commercial office buildings.A merged company might be able to sell enhanced building control systems alongside UTC’s Otis elevators. The company has already sought to bundle the equipment in packages to developers of new buildings, particularly in China.A Honeywell and UTC combination might provide a more effective counterweight to Johnson Controls and Tyco, which announced plans for a merger last month.Honeywell has outperformed both UTC and General Electric over the past five years. Its shares are up 89 per cent over that period, while GE’s are up 44 per cent and UTC’s are 14 per cent ahead.A takeover of UTC could be a big final deal for Dave Cote, 63, Honeywell’s chief executive, who according to several people involved has been the driving force behind a deal.At UTC, Greg Hayes has been seeking to drive up returns since taking over as chief executive in November 2014. His biggest step so far has been the $9bn sale of the company’s Sikorsky helicopter business to Lockheed Martin.At Monday’s share price, UTC’s market capitalisation is $77.4bn, while Honeywell’s is $80.9bn.Honeywell’s approach to UTC replicates a previous attempt to merge in 2000. That proposal fell apart after GE made a successful counter-offer for Honeywell. GE’s deal in turn collapsed after the European Commission blocked it on competition grounds.
64;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-02-23T01:31:15Z;Honeywell should learn from General Electric’s past;Failure of Honeywell-UTC merger talks has echoes of issues that undermined GE takeover of Honeywell;“Fact is, I damn near fell on the floor,” Jack Welch later recollected, writing of his reaction to the news in October 2000 that United Technologies was considering a takeover of Honeywell.That approach triggered an ill-fated counterbid from General Electric, confirmed with a famous handwritten fax from Mr Welch, then GE’s chief executive, to Mike Bonsignore, his Honeywell counterpart, as he and his board were about to sign the UTC deal.It would have been Mr Welch’s swansong ahead of retirement — just as a tie-up now with UTC could represent a final landmark transaction for Dave Cote, Honeywell’s longstanding chief executive.But in 2001, the European Commission ruined Mr Welch’s plans by rejecting the GE deal as potentially anti-competitive, despite US approval. The veto, later upheld by the European Court of First Instance, still stands as the most dramatic difference of opinion between EU and US competition regulators.Mr Welch is no longer at GE to spoil a Honeywell-UTC deal. But late on Monday, UTC poured cold water on the possibility, saying a merger would face “insurmountable regulatory obstacles and strong customer opposition”.Still, the prolonged flirtation between the two industrial companies serves to underline what has changed since 2000 — and what has not.Honeywell was vulnerable in 2000 partly because an unexpected profit warning marred the apparently smooth integration with AlliedSignal, which had bought it in 1999 and taken the Honeywell name. Both the UTC and GE takeovers clearly cast Honeywell as the target.Based on current valuations, UTC and Honeywell are now roughly equal in size. While UTC first approached Honeywell last year, it was the latter company, under Mr Cote, that then returned with an approach for the former.The potential for transatlantic regulatory drama has lessened since 2000. While the European court backed the commission on the substance of the GE-Honeywell veto in 2005, it criticised the antitrust regulator’s argument that bundling the groups’ products together would have allowed the combined company to dominate parts of the aerospace sector.The commission has had to restrain itself since, applying more internal checks and balances to its merger probes. Relations between Brussels and Washington over antitrust cases have also improved.You can never rule out a transatlantic spat over antitrust issues — witness the tension over competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s inquiries into Google’s dominance, and Apple and Amazon’s tax breaks — but it would be less likely now.Mr Welch’s bloody nose in Brussels also changed the way US companies — notably GE itself — tackle the question of merger clearance in Europe. In seeking approval for GE’s recent bid for Alstom of France’s energy business, Jeff Immelt, the group’s current chief executive, took a more team-based approach than Mr Welch had done 15 years earlier. Approval of that deal last year seemed to exorcise the ghost of the failed Honeywell takeover.But the drawn-out, and ultimately futile, GE-Honeywell inquiry still haunts dealmakers. “The dangers of unchecked bureaucracy are a constant thorn in the CEO’s side,” Mr Welch grumbled in Jack: Straight from the Gut, published just after the EU rebuff.UTC said on Monday it was afraid a Honeywell deal “could either be blocked outright or conditioned on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review period that would destroy shareholder value”.For now, then, the prospect of a takeover seems dead. If it ever revives, Mr Cote and Greg Hayes, his counterpart at UTC, would be advised to draw at least one clear lesson from Mr Welch’s experience in Brussels: do not rely on sheer force of personality to carry the day.

US issuers were the largest sellers of euro-denominated bonds by company domicile, writes Gavin Jackson.Honeywell will be meeting investors this week while Amgen and United Technologies will be marketing the following week with the bonds expected shortly after.The quantitative easing program launched by the European Central Bank last year held down interest rates on euro debt as well as leading the currency to slide in value against the dollar, so big companies crossed the Atlantic to take advantage of cheap debt and to match their European revenues with interest payments in the same currency.Now, with a difficult January out of the way and a couple days of improved performance in equity markets — partly due to the surprise announcement of further easing by the Bank of Japan — bankers say that investors are feeling more bullish and positive about new offerings, meaning that companies are likely to get more favourable prices.UK-based low-cost airline EasyJet is also expected to come to market with its first ever bond this Tuesday after successful investor meetings last month. The deal is expected to be a €500m seven-year offering, according to people familiar with the matter.Investors had a paucity of deals in January and so have large amounts of cash to put to work, according to one portfolio manager. With very little new supply, outstanding bonds have seen large increases in price, encouraging bankers to bring deals to market, the investor said. Still, he added that it is “relatively quiet compared to what it could be.”
69;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2016-01-24T10:38:06Z;Suppliers see silver lining in the Volkswagen scandal;Carmaker may cause backlash against diesel but component makers are gearing up for electric vehicles;Delphi Automotive, Dürr and Murata Manufacturing might not be household names.But they are part of the web of suppliers to a company that in recent months has been regularly hitting the headlines: Volkswagen.Europe’s largest carmaker was rocked by a scandal last September when it admitted installing software-based defeat devices in its diesel vehicles that enabled cheating in official tests for emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides.With VW braced for the affair to cost it billions of euros, and some early signs of a backlash against the German company among car buyers, there have been concerns that its 9,000 suppliers could also be affected.VW this month reported a 2 per cent fall in combined sales by its 12 brands last year — the first annual decline since 2002, with the drop being most severe at the core VW brand. Sales there fell 5 per cent.The poor performance was blamed on the scandal and turmoil in emerging markets, and some analysts say there is a risk the emissions affair could result in a broad consumer backlash against diesel cars made by all automobile manufacturers.But so far, Delphi of the US, Germany’s Dürr and Japan’s Murata Manufacturing — all important suppliers of components to carmakers — say they have not seen any negative effects from the VW scandal.Diesel vehicles dominate the European car market, although before the scandal, VW was trying to improve the technology’s image in the US, as part of efforts to increase its small market share in the country.John Hoffecker, vice-chairman of AlixPartners, the consulting firm, says suppliers that had been gearing up for VW’s big push into diesel in the US were doing so on the basis other carmakers would follow suit because of strict new fuel economy rules that take effect in the country in 2025.“They were assuming [diesel] was going to be one of the core technologies that were going to allow automakers to meet their 2025 testing targets,” he adds.“For those that were selling the parts, those companies are fairly significantly hit, and it was abrupt because VW was the largest [manufacturer of diesel vehicles].”Among US-listed suppliers, one of the few companies to have commented on its exposure to VW’s diesel vehicles is Honeywell, which provides turbochargers.Honeywell said at its third-quarter results in October that it was monitoring the VW emissions affair “very closely”, while stressing that sales to the carmaker amounted to less than 1 per cent of group turnover.One obvious risk for suppliers is that VW, as part of attempts to secure cost savings after the scandal, seeks to cut expenses with third parties providing components.Matthias Müller, VW’s new chief executive, played down this idea in December, saying the company would not “talk to our suppliers, mention the diesel issue and ask them to lower their prices. This is certainly not our style”.Suppliers provide the lion’s share of the electronic and mechanical components found in modern vehicles.Some suppliers that have significant sales with VW stress there are some potential silver linings to the scandal.The prospect of tougher emissions limits for diesel vehicles means carmakers will likely have to add more technology made by their suppliers.Faurecia, a French company that counts VW group as its number one customer, says it expects European emissions regulations to be “significantly tightened”, in a move that would accelerate sales of its products to counter diesel pollutants.The German carmaker is engulfed in the worst scandal in its 78-year history after it admitted to manipulating emissions test data on its diesel vehicles in the US and Europe. The deepening crisis has wiped billions of euros off the company’s shares and rocked the European car industry.All the news and analysisKyocera, a Japanese supplier, in November unveiled a sensor to monitor soot filters in diesel engines — a new product to be released in 2017 to help carmakers meet stricter emissions standards.“If there is a move towards tighter diesel regulations, high-performing components would be required. Kyocera would be well-placed in that case since that’s where our strength is,” says Goro Yamaguchi, president of Kyocera, which makes heat-resistant ceramic packages that protect chips in vehicles.As well as a likely dividend from tougher diesel regulations, some suppliers could also benefit if the VW scandal accelerates carmakers’ shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles.Kevin Clark, chief executive of Delphi, told analysts in October that, even if the VW scandal reduced use of diesel technology, it could still prove advantageous for the company because it typically provided more equipment for hybrid vehicles. “Net net, for us we don’t think it’s a big headwind,” he added.Japanese suppliers are also hoping to benefit from any further shift towards electric vehicles.Murata, the world’s biggest manufacturer of energy-storing ceramic capacitors for smartphones, laptops and cars, suggests the VW scandal could increase the popularity of hybrid and electric vehicles.“The clean image of diesel seems to have collapsed,” says Tsuneo Murata, Murata’s president. “We are not really affected [by the VW scandal], but the ratio of digitalisation is higher for hybrids and EVs so [a shift] could be positive for us.”One car parts supplier that has felt a direct impact from the Volkswagen scandal is Bosch.The privately-held German company, which gets significant business from VW but declines to say how much, has become involved in probes on both sides of the Atlantic.This is because the world’s biggest automotive supplier by sales made crucial parts for some of the 11m VW diesel vehicles affected by the emissions scandal, which began when the carmaker admitted to using software-based defeat devices within engine control mechanisms.Bosch supplied to VW a so-called common-rail injection system, which delivers diesel to the engine cylinders and seeks to offer high performance and quiet running combined with low fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The system includes an engine control unit.Bosch also made urea-dosing modules for the treatment of exhaust gas in some of the cars. Urea is a chemical that can breakdown nitrogen oxides that are emitted by diesel vehicles.However, Bosch has stressed that the way its components are calibrated and integrated into vehicles is “fundamentally the responsibility of each automaker”.Prosecutors in Stuttgart are investigating unidentified Bosch employees to establish whether staff knowingly helped VW in its alleged wrongdoing.A spokesman for the prosecutors said that the investigation was at an early stage and that no individuals had been charged.Bosch, which has about 360,000 employees and annual sales of almost €50bn, said it was “fully co-operating with authorities, assisting them in clarifying the facts concerning the exhaust-gas treatment issue”.It has also said previously it is co-operating with the US Environmental Protection Agency, which wants to know if the company was aware that VW tampered with software in Bosch-supplied equipment. “We are disclosing and delivering the information that has been requested,” added the company.
70;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-12-29T17:41:44Z;Melrose Industries confident about its next acquisition;Industrial group to return £2.4bn to shareholders after sale of utility meter business;Melrose Industries on Tuesday expressed optimism over securing its next big acquisition after unveiling plans to return more than £2bn to shareholders following the sale of Elster, its utility meter business.The industrial turnround group — which operates a “buy, improve, sell” model that has been likened to private equity — set out detailed plans to distribute £2.4bn among shareholders through an unusual “pre-packed” capital return, after European regulators last week approved the sale of German manufacturer Elster to Honeywell of the US.The £3.3bn disposal represents Melrose’s biggest transaction yet — and marks a handsome return on the £1.8bn it paid for Elster in August 2012. Melrose is already on the hunt for its next catch.“We are optimistic that a suitable acquisition will be identified to bring additional shareholder value and we look forward to inviting investors to participate in this next project in due course,” said Christopher Miller, Melrose’s chairman.Melrose’s business model is to buy an underperforming company, improve it, sell it at a profit and return cash to shareholders.Those shareholders have put in about £2bn since the company floated on Aim in 2003. But Mr Miller said the latest capital return would mean Melrose had handed back about £4.3bn to shareholders since its first acquisition in 2005.Under the terms of the return plans linked to the Elster deal, shareholders will receive one B share worth 240p for every ordinary Melrose share held at the market close on January 26. Those shares will exist for just one day and then be cancelled by court order, after which shareholders will receive cheques to the equivalent amount.Ordinary shares in the company will be temporarily suspended from trading. Thereafter the number of ordinary shares will be reduced to ensure the stability of the share price.The company said the unusual structure of the transaction would protect existing shareholders from dilution, stop new investors from benefiting from the return of capital after January 26 and ensure a speedy distribution of the proceeds from the Elster deal by February 5.Unusually, the company does not need to seek shareholder consent for the latest capital return. Melrose obtained preapproval from shareholders in October for a return of between £2bn and £2.5bn.As well as handing £2.4bn to shareholders, Melrose will use some of the proceeds from the Elster deal to reduce its borrowings.Following the transaction, Melrose’s one remaining business will be Brush, the Loughborough-based turbogenerator business. Though a leader in its sector, Brush is far smaller than Elster, and thought to be valued at between £500m and £800m.Melrose’s shares closed down 0.4 per cent at 293.1p on Tuesday. The shares have risen more than 20 per cent since the Elster deal was announced in July.

72;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-10-09T17:45:35Z;EU launches aircraft maintenance probe;Regulators focus on competition in $60bn a year repair market;European regulators are investigating whether airlines are being forced to enter anti-competitive contracts to keep their 24,000 aircraft flying, as equipment makers seek a slice of the $60bn a year maintenance and repair market.The European Commission has written to airlines and aircraft component manufacturers, asking for information about the provisions being written into service contracts — terms that could restrict choice when servicing everything from engines to wifi networks.“They are looking at the third parties that manufacturers licence for maintenance and at the data and information they share with those third parties,” said one airline, which recently received a detailed questionnaire from Brussels and preferred to remain anonymous.News of the inquiry comes as the airline industry shells out record sums for next-generation passenger and cargo aircraft, to help meet soaring global demand for air travel. Over the next 10 years, the global fleet is expected to grow from 23,927 in 2015 to more than 34,000.However, carriers have complained openly about increasingly restrictive service contracts and constraints on the choice of equipment that goes on an aircraft.Willie Walsh, chief executive of airline group IAG, this summer warned of possible legal action after expressing concern that limited competition might be keeping prices for aircraft, engines and maintenance services high.The European Commission refused to comment on the inquiry, which is at a very early stage and is not yet a formal investigation. However, commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso acknowledged the industry’s concerns. “The European Commission is closely monitoring competitive conditions as regards maintenance of engines and components for large commercial aircraft,” he said.Its inquiry is focusing on two specific products, including the CFM56 engine, which is the only choice on the Boeing next generation 737 single aisle aircraft and is made by General Electric and Safran’s CFM joint venture. CFM could not be reached for comment.Rolls-Royce, which provides the only engine for Airbus’s new wide-body, the A350 XWB, has also been approached by the commission. “We can confirm we have received a questionnaire from the European Commission and are working on our response,” it said.Honeywell, whose power units are widely used to keep the lights on when an aircraft is on the ground, confirmed it too had received a questionnaire. “Honeywell …is working to respond. We will co-operate,” the group said in a statement.The commission’s preliminary inquiry is expected to take several months before a decision on whether to launch a formal investigation is made. Companies will have roughly a month to reply, and further questionnaires could still be sent out.The maintenance, repair and overhaul market is set for robust growth over the next decade thanks to the unprecedented number of new generation aircraft coming into service. Aerospace consultancies such as ICF International and Technavio estimate the market will grow from $60bn this year to more than $80bn by 2025.Maintaining and repairing an aircraft accounts for roughly 10-13 per cent of an airline’s operating costs and the complex job of servicing the roughly 30,000 components on an aircraft is often outsourced to a third party.However, as aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus demand that suppliers share more risk on the development of new aircraft programmes, original equipment makers are seeking to recoup some of that investment by expanding in the high-margin business of servicing their products.
73;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-10-06T12:20:49Z;Melrose to return up to £2.5bn to shareholders following Elster sale;Sale of German meter manufacturer equates to 2.3 times equity investment;Melrose is to return between £2bn and £2.5bn to its shareholders once it completes the £3.3bn sale of its Elster meter business to US industrial giant Honeywell, its biggest deal yet.Christopher Miller, chairman of the UK engineering group whose business model has been likened to private equity, said: “We look forward to . . . delivering further shareholder value through our highly successful ‘buy, improve, sell’ model.”Melrose bought Elster, a German manufacturer of utility meters, for £1.8bn in August 2012, including an infusion of £1.2bn from shareholders and boosted its operating margins from 12.8 per cent to almost 20 per cent.The sale value equates to a return of 2.3 times the equity investment or a 33 per cent internal rate of return, a measure commonly used by private equity firms, Melrose said. It is also 30 per cent larger than the group’s market capitalisation before the announcement.As part of the deal, Honeywell will also take on two unrelated and indebted pension schemes, a fact it failed to disclose when it unveiled the acquisition in July.Melrose expects the Elster deal to close in the first quarter of 2016, following approval from US regulators. Some of the proceeds are likely to be used to pay off the group’s £742m net debt, plus fees and long-term incentives to Elster management. The group also intends to keep some of the purchase price to meet operating expenses.Elster employs 6,800 people and operates in 39 countries, with its major operations in the US, Germany, the UK and Slovakia. Shortly after acquiring it, Melrose reorganised the business into three separate units covering gas, electricity and water.The sale price implies a valuation multiple of 3.1 times 2014 revenue and 14.3 times 2014 headline earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Melrose.City dealmakers are eagerly awaiting the next move from Melrose. A person close to the company said it was “actively looking” for new acquisitions and that the most likely location was North America, but Germany was also a possibility. They added that a deal could be worth anywhere in the range of $2bn to $5bn.In addition, Melrose said it would create a new holding company structure to “efficiently and promptly return the proceeds of the disposal” to shareholders. This follows a similar corporate reorganisation in 2012 but Melrose said it would not affect the group’s trading operations.The reorganisation would make “it easier to make an acquisition were one to arise prior to the proposed capital return,” Andrew Carter, analyst at RBC, wrote in a note to clients.Shares in Melrose were flat at 274p on Tuesday, giving a market capitalisation of £2.73bn.
74;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-09-07T11:01:54Z;GE-Alstom deal could finally drive out Jack Welch’s ghost;Risks posed by politics and personalities can still complicate decisions by Europe’s competition regulator;"When General Electric bid for Honeywell in 2000, it was Jack Welch’s last “swing for the fences”. The GE chief executive handwrote the $43bn offer faxed to his Honeywell counterpart. He delayed his retirement to see through the takeover. He went alone in June 2001 to the last meeting in Brussels with Mario Monti, then European competition commissioner.So when the commission blocked the bid, it was Mr Welch’s reputation that suffered.This week, GE and the commission should finally exorcise the ghost of that decision, which shocked the US corporate and political establishment. Brussels is expected to approve, with conditions, the US group’s takeover of energy assets from Alstom of France.Many of the ingredients that spiced up the Honeywell case have changed, but when it comes to dealing with the EU regulator, a few important ones — including the risks posed by politics and towering personalities such as Mr Welch — can still complicate the handling of big deals.Since the Honeywell setback, GE has moved its European headquarters to Brussels. Thanks to the number of small deals it submits for commission approval, it has become expert at the merger process. Where Mr Welch tried to build a personal relationship with Mr Monti, who declined his invitation to “call me Jack” while talks were under way, Jeffrey Immelt, his less aggressive successor, has adopted a more formal, team-based approach.Margrethe Vestager, the youngest commissioner to hold the competition brief, differs from her predecessors, too. But a more important shift is that adverse court rulings after the Honeywell decision prompted the commission to refine and restrain its powers. Investigations are now subject to greater checks and balances, such as internal “devil’s advocate” panels. Alec Burnside, who heads the Brussels office of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, a law firm, says “the drama has largely gone out of antitrust cases”. That may be bad for reporters in search of a good set-to, but it is good for companies seeking certainty.Since 2001, when US president George W Bush publicly expressed his concerns about objections to GE’s bid, US-Brussels relations in this area have improved. But politics still simmers behind other cases, such as the ones Ms Vestager is investigating about Google’s dominance and Amazon and Apple’s tax breaks. These days, battles involving multinationals are never clear-cut by territory (and rarely were in the past — US rivals were among those that objected to the GE deal in 2001). But if Ms Vestager rules against these US-based giants, it is hard to imagine the transatlantic political temperature will remain tepid.Jeffrey Immelt’s approach to wooing Brussels was more low-keyEven the GE-Alstom transaction, though smaller and less potentially significant than GE-Honeywell, has had a political edge. After GE’s approach to Alstom leaked, and Germany’s Siemens emerged as a potential alternative suitor, Mr Immelt went to Paris to charm the French establishment, including President François Hollande, into becoming allies rather than antagonists. But he never staked everything on his personal ability as a deal-closer, the role Mr Welch assigned himself in 2001.Going it alone in Brussels is imprudent. Yet, says Mr Burnside, “it does still happen — and it comes to grief sometimes”. If GE has moved from imperial leadership of its bid strategy to an approach based more on the joint input of executives and advisers, others still believe in the pure power of a senior executive to convince regulators and legislators.For instance, Ryanair’s mouthy chief executive Michael O’Leary reportedly cooked up the airline’s first bid for Aer Lingus in 2006 with just two other executive directors, though they knew they would face a regulatory backlash. When Brussels blocked the deal, he denounced the decision as “bizarre, illogical, manifestly inaccurate and untenable”. The commission then vetoed another attempt in 2013.For GE’s Mr Immelt, approval of the Alstom acquisition could lay another ghost: that of his still ubiquitous predecessor. Mr Immelt is at last turning what was a US-centric empire, fuelled by its finance arm GE Capital and identified with its hard-headed boss, into a more focused industrial company, with most of its operations outside its home country. Assuming the GE-Alstom deal is approved, he may finally be able to echo Mr Monti at the end of that last meeting in 2001: “Goodbye, Jack.”andrew.hill@ft.com

75;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-09-01T16:00:41Z;General Electric set to secure approval for Alstom deal;European Commission expected to clear transaction after GE made concessions;General Electric is likely to win EU approval in the coming days for its $14bn deal to buy Alstom’s energy assets, according to people close to the deal who stress that the US conglomerate has offered significant remedies.GE’s partial takeover of France’s Alstom has been one of the most closely watched industrial deals in Europe after the European Commission raised concerns that it would damage competition in the market for massive turbines used to generate electricity from gas-fired power stations.If Brussels does unexpectedly block the deal before a September 11 deadline, it will revive memories of GE’s failed $42bn deal to buy Honeywell in 2001, when American executives were stunned that EU competition authorities had such wide-reaching powers to scupper a US transaction.A second veto against GE from Brussels this week or next could also prove politically explosive on both sides of the Atlantic. After weathering a storm about a US company buying large chunks of a French industrial champion, the government of President François Hollande is now investing diplomatic capital in ensuring the deal goes ahead to keep jobs in France.People at the European Commission and lawyers in Brussels said that GE had learnt lessons from the bruising Honeywell case, and noted that Jeff Immelt, chief executive, had taken a far more diplomatic approach than his predecessor, Jack Welch. Mr Immelt visited Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, two times during negotiations.“GE have clearly softened,” said one EU official. “Their whole approach has been very different.”Andreas Geiger, a lobbyist and founder of the law firm Alber & Geiger who is familiar with the Honeywell and Alstom cases, said that Mr Immelt “did a better lobbying job than Welch . . . but the expected EU merger clearance comes with a price tag which might have been avoided”.Brussels’ greatest concern was that the GE-Alstom group could control more than 50 per cent of the market in Europe and the rest of the world, excluding China, for turbines operating at the 50Hz frequency. The tie-up would also reduce GE’s competitors to only two main companies: Germany’s Siemens and Japan’s Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, with Italy’s Ansaldo Energia being a niche player.When the commission launched its probe of the GE-Alstom deal in February, the US company initially responded by flatly denying that its deal harmed customer choice, because only about four 50Hz frequency turbines were sold in Europe each year.General Electric said it was willing to sell intellectual property rights to allay European Commission concerns that its acquisition of Alstom could distort competition in the gas turbine market.Continue readingThe commission countered that the relatively small sales volumes were irrelevant in a sector as sensitive as power, where turbines cost hundreds of millions of euros.Despite its initial resistance, GE relented and offered concessions to Brussels in July, and people close to the matter said these proposals were received “positively”. On receiving feedback from Brussels, GE later further “tweaked” the terms of the deal.One person briefed on the case said the concessions scrutinised by the commission focused on GE divesting some of Alstom’s turbine-related business to Ansaldo, which is 40 per cent owned by China’s Shanghai Electric. Alstom’s main turbine business centres are in France and Switzerland.People in Brussels with knowledge of the case said technical points were still under discussion between GE and the commission, but did not think that these should stop the transaction being approved.Emmanuel Macron, France’s economy minister, has been leading Paris’s charm offensive towards the commission. In July, he noted that the talks with Brussels were going well, saying: “We remain on our guard but, on the plan itself, we have seen rather reassuring elements.”When asked in July about GE’s plan B in case the Alstom deal was blocked, Mr Immelt replied: “I am not going there.”Edward T Swaine, professor of law at George Washington University, said that the challenges on the Alstom deal were markedly different from the Honeywell case. “It’s a different time and transaction. One thing that startled many last time was the interest the commission took in a transaction between American companies that had been cleared by the [US] Department of Justice,” he added.“The question now is whether GE’s proposed remedy is enough to satisfy commission concerns that are particular to the results for competition in Europe — while GE continues to view this as a question of global markets and global strategy.”GE, noting the commission’s final decision was due by September 11, said: “We have submitted a remedy package that addresses the commission’s concerns and preserves the economics of the deal.” Alstom declined to comment. Ansaldo could not be reached.Additional reporting by Peggy Hollinger and Rachel Sanderson
76;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-08-11T14:01:38Z;US says insider trading ring used hackers;Nine accused of trading on 150,000 stolen company press releases;US authorities have charged nine people with being in a global hacking and insider-trading ring, alleging they made $30m in illegal profits by trading on stolen information from 150,000 press releases before they were made public.The case marks a new front in US law enforcement’s fight against insider traders because those indicted are not company insiders but alleged cyber criminals.The suspected hackers lived in Ukraine, while others allegedly involved in securities trading resided in the US state of Georgia, according to US authorities. Four additional co-conspirators also lived in Georgia, New York and Pennsylvania. Five of the suspects who live in the US were arrested.The suspects were charged in federal courts in New York and Newark, New Jersey. The indictments were announced at a press conference late Tuesday morning by Paul Fishman, US attorney for New Jersey, Kelly Currie, acting US attorney in Brooklyn, homeland security secretary Jeh Johnson, secret service director Joseph Clancy, Securities and Exchange Commission chief Mary Jo White and others.A parallel civil complaint by the SEC is aimed at a wider ring of suspects, naming 32 people and companies who live in or are based in Russia, Malta, France and Cyprus. The SEC, which has a lower legal bar to meet in civil charges, alleges the suspects reaped $100m in profits.“This international scheme is unprecedented in terms of the scope of the hacking, the number of traders, the number of securities traded and profits generated,” Ms White said. “That deception ends today as we have exposed their fraudulent scheme and frozen their assets.”The stolen press release data covered earnings and mergers involving companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Netflix, Delta Air Lines, Boeing, Bank of America, Ford Motor, Honeywell and Viacom, according to one of the indictments.Devastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. The FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to fight back against the hackersThe suspects allegedly traded ahead of the releases in 800 instances. The transactions were executed through the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, Knight Capital or Direct Edge, according to the indictment.For about five years starting around February 2010, the suspects hacked into the networks of Marketwired, PR Newswire and Business Wire to steal confidential press releases before they were made public, according to one of the indictments.Mr Currie said the scheme was an “unholy alliance” between hackers and traders, while Mr Fishman claimed it was a “full service” business with the hackers providing tutorials and the traders giving shopping lists.“The hackers were relentless and they were patient,” Mr Fishman said.In one example, Caterpillar was set to announce its third-quarter earnings on October 24 2011 and sent its release to PR Newswire three days before that date. By accessing the release before it was made public, the suspects made a profit of about $648,000.In another example, the suspects made $1m by stealing information from Panera Bread’s press release that said it was downgrading its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. The press release was sent to Marketwired on October 22 2013 and made public a day later.The suspected hackers are Ivan Turchynov and Oleksander Ieremenko, who both lived in Ukraine. Arkadiy Dubovoy, his son Igor Dubovoy, and relative Pavel Dubovoy allegedly engaged in securities trading and live in Georgia and Ukraine, respectively.Their alleged co-conspirators, some of whom were broker-dealers registered with the SEC, are Vitaly Korchevsky, Vladislav Khalupsky, Aleksandr Garkusha and Leonid Momotok.It was not clear if the suspects have legal representation and they could not be reached for comment.The trader defendants are accused of paying the alleged hackers for access to the press release servers, and their fee was based partly on a percentage of the profits in the insider-trading scheme.A foreign bank account of Tanigold Assets Ltd, an overseas entity connected to Pavel Dubovoy, was used to send some of the proceeds from the insider trading to the alleged hackers, the indictment said. Two overseas shell companies were also used by the alleged hackers to receive additional profits.The hackers allegedly used a variety of techniques, including injecting malware, launching spear phishing attacks that involve fake emails, decrypting data in “brute force attacks” and other methods.

Although the bulk of the deficits are attached to the Elster pension plan, the FKI and McKechnie schemes carry deficits of £29m.John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant, said: “This deal is a first. For the pension liabilities of unrelated companies to shift to Honeywell is unbelievable. The fact Honeywell is taking on both the FKI and McKechnie pension schemes, which are totally unconnected to Elster, is a first in corporate dealmaking. Honeywell appear to have been very quiet about this.”Mr Ralfe likened the deal to someone selling their house but including the toxic waste from a neighbouring garden in the sale.He said: “It is an excellent deal for Melrose’s shareholders, who in one bound are free of legacy pensions from businesses they have largely sold off.“But it is not an excellent deal for Honeywell shareholders, who are being saddled with pension liabilities totally unconnected to their businesses, with no obvious reduction in the price Honeywell is paying for Elster.”A spokesman for Honeywell, the US aerospace part manufacturer, said of the total deficits: “The pension underfunding represents approximately 4 per cent of the total purchase price and was therefore not a focus of our prepared materials. The pension deficit was worked into the purchase price.”He added that the pension issue was addressed during its investor conference call. A transcript of that call, however, shows no mention was made of FKI and McKechnie, although pension deficits were discussed.A spokesman for Melrose said of the pension shift: “It was a condition of the sale. When it was first introduced as a condition, the Honeywell team ‘went away to think about it’. Their actuaries clearly felt taking on the other pension fund obligations presented no issues and they were happy to include this element as part of the deal.”Mr Ralfe said that although the total deficits account for £134m, for Honeywell to shift that to a third-party pension specialist would cost £300m.
78;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-07-28T17:01:28Z;Melrose: in the right place;Industrial group will be looking to buy more after selling Elster at profit;Is a £1.5bn profit enough to leave the golf course for? Christopher Miller and David Roper — happily retired until they founded Melrose, the UK-listed industrial group, in 2003 — seem to think so. Melrose’s strategy is to buy and sell companies. On Tuesday it announced its biggest disposal to date. It will receive £3.3bn from Honeywell for Elster, the metering company it bought in 2012 for £1.8bn. Beats a hole in one.Melrose looks for underperforming industrial and manufacturing businesses headquartered in northern Europe and North America. Since inception it has spent more than £3bn on four big acquisitions. After selling Elster, Melrose will have only Brush, a turbogenerator builder. Brush’s sales will increase when a Chinese factory opens, but accounting for less than a fifth of group operating profit last year it is much smaller than Elster. Melrose will be looking to buy more.It does not plan to use the Elster proceeds for those deals, however. More than £2bn will be returned to shareholders via a special share issue. The rest of the proceeds will be spent on incentives for Elster’s management, deal fees and on repaying £750m of debt. So Melrose will shrink dramatically. That said, it is unlikely to struggle to raise finance for its next deal — it took only one week to raise the £1.2bn to buy Elster.And returning cash to shareholders is an important part of Melrose’s strategy. To date it has returned more than £1bn to shareholders. Over 10 years its shares have lost 2 per cent but provided a total return of 327 per cent.So the structure is in place: buy an underperforming company, improve it, sell it at a huge profit and return cash to shareholders. The big challenge will be to find the next deal. Valuations across all asset classes have risen in recent years. Underperforming widget makers will be no exception. Melrose shareholders at least have the comfort of knowing that, having returned the cash from the last deal, Messrs Miller and Roper do not need to rush into the next one.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The actions reduced its profits by $128m over that period.In addition, Hertz said that it expects to achieve annualised cost savings of $300m by the end of year, up from its previous estimates for $200m, and reaffirmed its $1bn share buyback programme.Analysts at JPMorgan said they expect the stock to be up “significantly” as Hertz is now “an investable name for many investors who have been on the sidelines”.The news came alongside Hertz’s full-year outlook for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation in the range of $1.45 to $1.55bn. This compared with Wall Street forecasts for $1.55bn.“This is a transition year, and we are not going to be satisfied with the results quarter-by-quarter,” said chief executive, John Tague. “Progress on our initiatives to reduce capacity, meet our fleet refresh targets and capture cost savings will be evident in the third quarter, which we believe will be an inflection point for the year.”The company, which received a warning from the NYSE earlier this year, said that all its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are now up to date.Shares of Hertz, which have fallen more than 30 per cent in the past year, advanced 11.9 per cent to $19.01.Shares of industrial bellwether Honeywell, gained 1.9 per cent to $105.54 after the company reported second-quarter earnings and sales that topped Wall Street forecasts.The company also lifted its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $6.05 to $6.15 a share, compared with Wall Street projections for earnings of $6.10 a share.Mattel shares fell 3.3 per cent to $24.31 after the toymaker swung to a loss in the second quarter.The El Segundo, California-based company reported a loss of $11.4m, or 3 cents a share, in the three months to the end of June from a profit of $28.3m a year earlier. This was narrower than forecasts for a loss of 5 cents a share.Meanwhile, sales declined 7 per cent to $988m, modestly below expectations.Google shares surged 16.3 per cent to $699.62, after the search engine reported adjusted second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street forecasts and promised more discipline to its cost controls.The Nasdaq Composite posted another record close on Friday as Google helped push the index higher, even as utilities and energy stocks weighed on the broader S&P 500.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 5,210.14.

80;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2015-06-10T16:01:57Z;Global reach calls for lawyers with wide skills set;Regional professionals need to have a variety of talents, ranging from communications to business leadership;In-house lawyers in Asia-Pacific companies are taking on new roles to help businesses expand and invest overseas, while those at global companies are developing solutions to navigate the unique challenges of managing legal functions across the region.Chinese businesses are becoming influential global players at an increasing pace. Their legal departments have become driving forces behind rapid international expansion. With essential technical expertise and international experience, in-house lawyers have been propelled from the back-office to the frontline of strategic decision-making and complex deals.None exemplify the trend as well as this year’s winning legal team from Chinese internet company Alibaba. In September 2014, Alibaba’s $25bn initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange was the largest ever IPO globally. Led by general counsel Tim Steinert, the legal team created a unique management structure to allow the company to retain its entrepreneurial and founder-led culture after it went public. The model gives a group of partners elected from the company’s senior management ranks the exclusive right to nominate a majority of the board of directors and maintain a degree of control.Mr Steinert says his focus has equally been on “the development of an international-class legal department, whose size and specialisation is unique in China”. Many of the team’s innovations support moving Alibaba’s commercial and legal processes online. It is at the forefront of a global shift towards collecting large data sets to undertake more scientific analyses of trends in areas such as product and contractual disputes.In a similar fashion, the legal team at fellow Chinese media and internet company Tencent topped the ranking last year and continues to innovate. With economists and policy advisers, it is driving research to guide governments and cities as they embrace “mobile life” in China. The team plays an active role driving debate on internet censorship and development.In many cases, the international experience of lawyers working in growing Asian companies makes them the best equipped to bridge traditional management and business cultures. Lawyers have become pivotal communicators and translators between their companies and overseas investors, regulators and partners.Fosun, the Chinese investment company, created an international legal team in the past year to support its growing acquisitions. The team comprises 12 lawyers, each with mainland Chinese and international qualifications and experience. Co-general counsel Yao Xu heads the team. He says: “Chinese companies usually hire intermediaries to work with local counsel [but] we don’t need to do that. Our lawyers have the international skills and background to deal with local counsel and the target companies directly.”Masako Nomoto leads the transactions management team at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, a joint venture between the leading Japanese and US-headquartered banks.She describes the most important aspect of her role as “being a communicator, translating between business and legal, and between international and domestic Japanese business expectations and culture”.Her team has enabled some of the highest-profile and most complex transactions out of Japan in recent years including brewery group Suntory Holdings’ inaugural international bond offering and subsequent acquisition of US spirits company Beam, and Mitsubishi Motors’ global equity offering in 2014.Within multinational businesses, a regional general counsel faces particular challenges managing a variety of functions in high-risk legal environments. Thierry Lintermans, associate general counsel for contracting in Asia-Pacific with Accenture, the global consultancy, says: “My team covers a diversity of languages, cultures and time zones in Asia-Pacific that you don’t have elsewhere, so it is more complex.”In-house Legal TeamMr Lintermans’ team created the Accenture Legal Opportunity Tracker, a knowledge management platform that allows the team to monitor and report on projects, resources and clients regionally. Accenture is now considering further uses of the tool outside Asia.At Honeywell, the legal team has supported expansion into high-growth and developing economies by providing a broad analysis of technological, commercial and legal risks. “Our role is to do a risk analysis rather than just a legal analysis,” says Gerard Willis, Asia-Pacific general counsel. “In the US you would just get a legally valid and binding opinion and you’d be done. But in jurisdictions without fully developed legal protections you just can’t do that.”The remit of in-house Asia-Pacific lawyers is unusually broad. The most important role may be that of business leader, such as general counsel Edith Shih at investment company Hutchison Whampoa. She joined the Hong-Kong-based conglomerate in 1993 as its sole legal counsel and built a legal team of 280 to support the business as it has grown into a Fortune 500 company operating in 52 countries. She has been described as one of the key driving forces behind the company’s success — an enviable accolade for a company lawyer.

On Friday, General Electric announced it would divest most of its GE Capital unit. Apart from the regulatory headache that comes from owning assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars, GE’s decision was driven by an attractive deal market. Newly ascendant “speciality” finance companies are expected buyers of big chunks of the business. Yet the beleaguered, though still formidable, big banks may well also show up to bid.GE has forecast that its industrial business will earn $1.20 a share in 2015. Assuming that on its own the industrial business would receive the same earnings multiple as rival Honeywell (17), GE Capital traded at just half of its $90bn book value before Friday. Recent transactions, and with the 10 per cent rally in GE shares on Friday, suggest that GE could get prices near book value for the divested assets.Friday’s $26.5bn sale of commercial real estate to a Blackstone-led group was completed at a near book value. A few weeks ago GE sold its Australia and New Zealand consumer business to another private equity consortium for two times book. GE also listed its US credit card business, Synchrony Financial, last summer. Its shares trades at 2.5 times book. In another noteworthy transaction, subprime consumer lender Springleaf paid two times book for Citigroup’s OneMain; The buyer’s shares still jumped.The $200bn worth of GE assets up for sale is largely comprised of various middle-market commercial lending businesses. Private equity and equipment lenders will figure in the auctions. But the opportunity for big banks, who are awash in cheap liquidity from deposits, is to pluck out loan portfolios whose capital requirements are not too onerous — for example, solid real estate loans. Wells Fargo teamed up with Blackstone on Friday to snatch $9bn in performing loans from GE Capital. Garage sales draw an interesting crowd.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
82;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T02:00:22+0000;Honeywell and DuPont hit by EU antitrust;Collaboration over coolant to meet emissions rules falls foul;Honeywell and DuPont were hit with EU antitrust charges on Tuesday for allegedly acting in an anti-competitive manner when jointly developing the only car coolant that meets EU emissions standards.The European Commission served the US groups with the so-called “statement of objections” that covered a more narrow set of complaints than the case it began investigating in 2011.At issue is the controversial chemical known as HFO-1234yf, which is expected to open a lucrative income stream for the two groups as it is the only coolant on the market compliant with EU rules on greenhouse gas emissions for new cars.If the commission’s concerns over the groups co-operating to harm competition are proven, it has the power to levy fines of up to 10 per cent of a company’s global turnover. The case stems from a complaint by French rival Arkema.Honeywell said the allegations were “baseless” and in “conflict with the EU’s own laws that encourage collaboration on development”. It added that it was “confident” the commission will find it acted in compliance with EU competition rules.Dupont said: “We will fight this every step of the way, as it has no basis in law or fact.” It added that it was “disappointed” to see the commission adopt the charges in the dying days of its mandate before a new competition commissioner has chance to review the case.The antitrust charges come amid a separate and long-running spat over the use of the chemical. Last month Germany was ordered by the commission to force Daimler, the carmaker, to stop using chemicals that are banned for being highly potent global warming gas. Daimler argues that the replacement R1234yf is dangerously flammable.The antitrust case against Honeywell and DuPont rests on whether aspects of their 2010 pact to develop, license and produce the R1234yf chemical may have stifled competition and “limited its availability and technical development”.Central to the charges are the parts of the pact relating to production arrangements and the development of production processes, according to the commission. It said the arrangements between the groups “reduced their decision-making independence and resulted in restrictive effects on competition”.“These effects include a limitation of the available quantities of the new refrigerant that would have otherwise been brought to the market, as well as a limitation of related technical development,” the commission added.A second strand to the investigation examined whether Honeywell engaged in “deceptive conduct” during the evaluation of the chemical by not fully disclosing its patents and refusing to license the chemical on reasonable terms.This was dropped from the statement of objections in the past few weeks during the commission’s internal deliberations.
83;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2014-10-20T20:01:26Z;Larger aeroplanes still dominate business skies;Customers are demanding longer range aircraft with larger cabins but the market for smaller models is also recovering;Midsize jets are still losing out to larger jets, which are going to continue to dominate the business aviation market, according to Honeywell’s latest forecast of the industry.The annual survey, released as the industry gathers in Orlando for its biggest annual convention, suggests larger aircraft ranging from the so-called “super midsize” to the “ultra-long range” will make up more than three-quarters of all spending on new business jets. This larger category will account for 60 per cent of new business jets bought during the next decade.Driving the market are large numbers of super midsize jets ordered by fractional service providers. There are order backlogs for the Gulfstream G650, says Brian Sill, president of business and general aviation at Honeywell Aerospace.Honeywell defines the large class as super midsize up to the high-speed long-range class, taking in aircraft such as Bombardier’s Challenger 350, the Gulfstream G280 and G650 and aircraft such as Bombardier’s Global 7000 and 8000, currently under development.“We are expecting new airplanes that are coming on line in the next few years to also do very, very well because of their performance characteristics,” he says. “That will include some of the new Falcon models that are coming out of Dassault, as well as the [Bombardier] Global 7000 and 8000.”Honeywell raised its forecast for total deliveries of business jets over the next decade by 7 per cent to 9,450.Range was the main reason cited for choice of jet, Mr Sill says – as the nature of business becomes more globalised – followed by cabin comfort.But the midsize jet category has been recovering, after sales in that class were hit by the global financial crisis.The Honeywell survey recorded improved interest in the midsize and small cabin models of aircraft this year, which picked up market share for the first time in several years.New models have attracted interest, such as the PC-24 twin-engined business jet under development by Pilatus Aircraft in Switzerland. There is steady demand for Embraer’s Phenom 300, the Cessna Citation 3 and 4 and the Bombardier Learjet 75.Cessna is upgrading its Latitude range, which is expected to receive certification next year. A close competitor, the Embraer Legacy 450, is also due to enter service at the same time.Marco Túlio Pellegrini, president and chief executive of Embraer Executive Jets, is confident about prospects for the midsize market. “The midsize [segment] will be the next one to show positive growth,” he says.Kriya Shortt, head of sales and marketing for Textron Aviation, insists the mid-market has been resilient. “The market as a whole continues to be very good. The XLS [a midsize jet] is unique in its class,” she says. “It has a great combination of range, speed and performance. Customers on both the corporate and charter side consistently select this model.” Cessna’s Citation XLS is the world’s best-selling business jet.In June, the Cessna Citation X+ was certified, featuring improvements in speed, range and cabin size. “We see folks coming into the segment asking for larger cabins. They want big,” she says.Prospects for the midsize market will improve as the global economy picks up, Mr Sill says. “We’re bullish on the medium-class aircraft and we’re expecting that part of the market to expand.“There are some nice new models that are coming on line in the next few years and there’s also been suppressed demand in that class for the past few years, so there may be some catch-up demand as we get past the current economic concerns,” Mr Sill says, adding that manufacturers would also offer improvements to aircraft in that class to win new customers.Eric Martel, president of Bombardier business aircraft, is bullish about the outlook for business jets as a whole.“The market is going to be strong in the next 20 years,” he says. “The large segment has been a significant driver in growth, despite the [economic] situation.”

Sales increased 5 per cent to $10.1bn.This beat analysts’ estimates for earnings of $1.12 a share on $10.04bn.The company also raised the low-end of its full-year earnings guidance to a range of $5.50 to $5.55, from $5.45 to $5.55.“Looking ahead to 2015, we’re once again planning for a slow growth macro environment but expect to continue delivering strong earnings growth,” said David Cote, chief executive at Honeywell.“Organic growth of 5% was better than we expected (and the best among peers so far) plus margins are solid,” said Steven Winoker, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein.“The fourth quarter does appear a bit light to us and below our current estimate given they only increased the low end of guidance (as usual) but we think conservatism in the current environment is appropriate.”Honeywell shares climbed 4 per cent to $90.06.Shares of Urban Outfitters fell 14 per cent to $29.62 after the retailer said negative comparable store sales have continued and could lead to weaker third-quarter earnings.Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stocks to “neutral” from “buy” and lowered their price target to $31 from $44.“We still believe in the long term potential of the story and are optimistic an Urban Outfitters brand turnround is on the horizon but, with the Anthropologie brand now showing signs of softness, we are concerned a recovery in earnings per share and sentiment will take longer to materialise,” said Lindsay Mann, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.Shares of General Electric climbed 2 per cent to $24.82 after the company reported a jump in third-quarter profits.Net income rose to $3.5bn, or $34 cents a share, in the quarter compared with $3.1bn, or $32 cents, in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenues edged up 1 per cent to $36.1bn.Google shares slipped 3 per cent to $522.97 after profits fell 5 per cent to $2.8bn or $4.09 per share in the three months to the end of September as expenses climbed.One of the biggest concerns about Google is its ability to remain as relevant in mobile advertising as it has been on the desktop, analysts at Goldman Sachs said.Analysts at Goldman, Deutsche Bank and other banks cut their price target.Shares of SanDisk slipped 3 per cent to $82.80 after the company saw third-quarter profits fall.The chipmaker reported net income of $263m or $1.09 per share compared with $277m or $1.18 per share in the prior-year period.After a volatile couple of trading sessions, US stocks rallied as markets appeared to take encouragement from St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard’s comments on Thursday that the Fed should delay ending its asset purchase programme.The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 per cent to 1,886.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.6 per cent to 16,380.41 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent to 4,258.44.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
85;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
86;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2014-08-18T12:17:53Z;‘What-if’ musings that drive leaders mad;The heroic all-or-nothing strategic decision is largely a fiction;"As this month’s centenary of the outbreak of the first world war drew nearer, historians jousted over what the world would have looked like if the bullet Gavrilo Princip aimed at Archduke Franz Ferdinand had missed, or if Britain had not leapt to Belgium’s defence.Corporate “what ifs” are discussed far more rarely. That is why it was striking to hear Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Prudential, again reminding shareholders last week about the “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” the UK insurer lost when they stymied its $36bn bid for rival Asian company AIA in 2010.Mr Thiam’s obsession with the road not taken is understandable. Commentators, including me, attacked him at the time for failing to consult investors adequately and accused him of hubris (he was less than six months into the job of chief executive). Gallingly for Mr Thiam, the regulator gave him a slap last year and fined the Pru for not telling the watchdog about the planned deal. Meanwhile, the company’s own Asian business has grown and AIA is worth substantially more than the UK insurer would have paid for it.Mr Thiam has earned the right to say “I told you so”. But most chief executives should not use up energy fretting about missed chances. The moment to assess the opportunity cost of not taking a particular path comes before the decision, if possible with the benefit of some devil’s advocacy, to reveal the possible pitfalls of different choices. If a transaction will not work, moving on is the best course, as 21st Century Fox did when, to Wall Street bankers’ distress, it recently decided not to pursue media rival Time Warner. “We walked away. This is our resolute decision,” declared Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch. No room for counterfactual speculation there.Excessive nostalgia for unconsummated deals – or regret for the ones that went wrong – can be a distraction. It can even drive some leaders slightly mad. Company founders who sell their businesses, have second thoughts, and spend the rest of their careers trying to buy them back, remind me of Captain Ahab in pursuit of Moby-Dick.It is amusing to consider a few alternative corporate histories: the European Commission approves General Electric’s bid for Honeywell in 2001, securing Jack Welch’s legacy as creator of an industrial powerhouse; Eastman Kodak pours investment into its early digital camera technology and emerges as the leading photography brand for a new age, despite the disappearance of analogue roll-film; Nokia accelerates development of touchscreen smartphones and, by the time Apple’s iPhone comes out, already has a strong beachhead against competitors.But the imponderables in such scenarios are too numerous. In the short term, for instance, given Honeywell and GE’s exposure to civil aviation, a merger would probably have damaged the group, given what happened on September 11 2001, and the impact on the industry of those terror attacks. Since then, though, Honeywell has outperformed GE. In the case of the Pru and AIA, it is impossible to know whether cross-border integration of two large companies would have succeeded or failed.Most chief executives who get bogged down in exploration of what might have been are perpetuating two fallacies. One is the assumption that one big strategic decision could dictate the future of the company they head. The other is that individuals – particularly chief executives – are themselves critical to deciding that future.As historian Sir Richard Evans has written, “the problem with counterfactuals is that they almost always treat individual human actors as completely unfettered” by larger forces. Corporate leaders’ plans are inevitably based on circumstances, which are themselves in part determined by previous decisions and those larger forces. They should judge each strategic move on the basis of whether it takes their company to the next stage of improvement. At that point another strategic decision will be needed, based on new circumstances.The heroic all-or-nothing strategic decision is largely a fiction. As a result, trying to picture whether different decisions would have led to different outcomes is as futile as wondering whether, if Ahab had harpooned the great white whale early in his career, he would have retired to a small scrimshaw-filled house in Nantucket, or perished at sea later, in the hunt for an even bigger trophy."

Airlines reacted swiftly to the news, with US and European carriers rerouting traffic away from the country.“At this time, it is important we are very clear: safety is the top priority. No airline will risk the safety of their passengers, crew and aircraft for the sake of fuel savings,” Tony Tyler, chairman of the International Air Transport Association, said.The Bloomberg world airlines index climbed 0.7 per cent, following a 2 per cent decline on Thursday. The index was led by US airlines, which operate fewer routes over continental Europe than international peers including Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa.Delta shares rose 2 per cent to $37.18, American Airlines climbed 3 per cent to $42.92 and United Continental advanced 2 per cent to $44.25.AMD, the chipmaker that was once valued at $20bn, plunged on Friday after forecasting third quarter sales short of analyst expectations.The company said it expected revenues to rise 2 per cent from the preceding quarter, plus or minus 2 to 3 per cent. The view equates to net revenues between $1.43bn and $1.51bn.AMD has been at work repositioning itself away from its core desktop PC market, after years of declining demand from businesses and consumers.“While management has executed well to some key milestones, the structural headwinds continue to dominate the company’s fate,” John Pitzer, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said.Shares slumped 16 per cent to $3.83, reducing its market capitalisation below $3bn.Google shares climbed 4 per cent to $595.08 after the company said revenues, excluding sales handed on to partners, exceeded Wall Street forecasts.The company behind the namesake search engine generated revenues of $12.7bn in the three months to the end of June, topping forecasts of $12.3bn. Profits rose to $3.4bn in the quarter, up from $3.2bn a year earlier.Google is grappling with how to lift advertising rates as more consumers read ads on mobile devices, which historically command lower rates than desktop adverts.Although the average price for an ad slipped 6 per cent from a year earlier, that topped predictions of a 7 per cent decline. Total clicks on the ads it served rose 25 per cent last quarter, matching analyst forecasts.“We believe Google continues to gain share both in Search and Display, fuelled by its own sites, which is impressive considering its leading position in both segments,” Youssef Squali, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said.American manufacturer Honeywell lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast as demand increases across its businesses.As a result, the company expects earnings per share for the full-year to be between $5.45 and $5.55, compared to earlier guidance as low as $5.40 per share.Chief executive Dave Cote said positive trends were emerging for the manufacturer with “growing robust backlogs supported by favourable macro trends and strong win rates”.Shares of Honeywell rose 2 per cent to $96.82.VF Corp, the owner of The North Face and Timberland brands, was under pressure following weaker than expected earnings guidance.The company, which topped second quarter forecasts, said it expected to earn $3.06 per share for the full year, three cents below Wall Street consensus.Citi analysts noted store checks indicated the company was making progress diversifying its business away from brands focused on winter apparel, which would boost first-half results.VF shares fell 1 per cent on the news to $60.95.Overall, US equity markets rebounded after a jolt of volatility on Thursday tempered investor enthusiasm and sent Treasury yields sharply lower.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,978.22 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7 per cent to 17,100.18.

88;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2014-06-18T21:14:15Z;US urged to tighten safety regulation after Dreamliner fire;UK recommends new rules for lithium battery use in aviation;US regulators should draw up new safety standards for the use of certain batteries on passenger jets following the fire on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow airport last year, according to UK aviation investigators.The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch, in a report published on Wednesday, said the US Federal Aviation Administration should develop enhanced certification requirements for the use of lithium-metal batteries in aviation.The AAIB said the most likely cause of the fire on the Dreamliner at Heathrow last year was a lithium-metal battery, although no final conclusions have been reached.The Dreamliner, Boeing’s newest and most sophisticated jet, has been rocked by a series of incidents since it entered service in 2011 – notably in January last year the aircraft was temporarily grounded by regulators after batteries burned on two 787s.These lithium-ion batteries, used to power some of Dreamliner’s electrical systems, are different to the one that caught fire on a 787 parked at Heathrow in July last year and operated by Ethiopian Airlines.This lithium-metal battery powered the aircraft’s emergency locator transmitter – equipment made by Honeywell and used to trace the jet in the event it goes missing.The AAIB said examination of the transmitter found evidence that its internal battery pack had suffered what is known as a “thermal runaway” – an increase in temperature and pressure that can lead to fire and explosion.It added that, following work with Boeing and Honeywell, the most probable cause of the thermal runaway was a short circuit caused by the way in which the transmitter’s battery wires had been “improperly installed”.Shortly after the incident, the FAA ordered inspections of Honeywell transmitters on other Dreamliners.Honeywell subsequently called for inspections of transmitters powered by lithium-metal batteries on all aircraft types. A total of 3,650 batteries identical to the one that caught fire at Heathrow were in service at that time.The AAIB said 28 transmitters were found to have “trapped wires” around their batteries – but none showed signs of suffering a thermal runaway.Honeywell, having become aware in February last year of “wiring anomalies” on one transmitter’s battery, introduced changes to the equipment’s assembly instructions to guard against a recurrence of the problem.The AAIB said it was time to update the FAA’s minimum performance standards for lithium-metal batteries used in aircraft because these requirements were drawn up in 2000 and were partly based on a 1995 document drawn up by one of the regulator’s advisory bodies.“The guidance and requirements in [this document], written in 1995 based on available knowledge, are now outdated and do not adequately take account of the progress in lithium battery technology and operational feedback over the intervening two decades,” added the AAIB.

This compares with the IPO price of $17 a share.“It is the best pure play social networking platform in China,” said analyst Gene Munster. “At current levels, Weibo shares trade at a slight discount to the company’s peer group and . . . we believe that Weibo deserves to trade at a premium multiple to the group given our expectation for higher growth.”Mr Munster said the company had well positioned itself with small and medium sized businesses in China, and had substantial room to grow its business in that market.The company has had a rocky debut since floating, with shares falling more than a fifth since a peak in April. Strategists at Citigroup said first-quarter earnings trends had brought “growth into question” for small and mid-cap stocks, taking valuation concerns to the forefront.“Short term, our trading indicators suggest oversold conditions, but it may take more conviction in improving macros to change sentiment,” said Citi’s Scott Chronert.Shares in Weibo rose 9.3 per cent to close at $19.52. Facebook climbed 4.5 per cent to $59.83, Twitter advanced 5.9 per cent to $33.94 and Netflix increased 5.1 per cent to $345.45. TripAdvisor rose 5.8 per cent to $89.51.Overall, the broader Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 4,143.86, although trading volumes were roughly 6 per cent lower than the index’s 30-day trailing average.Gogo Wireless, the company that provides in-flight WiFi, jumped 6.2 per cent to $12.67 after reporting better than expected sales in the first quarter.The company said sales rose 35 per cent from a year earlier to $96m, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Losses narrowed from the year ago period to $16.9m, or 20 cents per share. Analysts had on average expected a loss of 25 cents a share.Shares in the company had been blunted in April by AT&T’s announcement that it would partner with Honeywell to offer a similar service.Peabody Energy advanced 2.4 per cent to $19.11 as investment bank Morgan Stanley lifted its view of the company to “overweight” and increased its price target by 50 per cent “in light of the ongoing modest recovery in the thermal coal market and bottoming met coal prices”.“We believe Peabody is currently the best way to get exposure to these two themes while still managing downside risk,” said analyst Stephen Byrd.Hillshire Brands agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods for $6.6bn, including debt, sending shares in Pinnacle up 13.2 per cent to $34.47.Under the terms of the deal announced by the companies on Monday, Pinnacle investors will receive $18 in cash and 0.5 Hillshire shares for each Pinnacle share they own.Hillshire’s offer is also an exit for private equity group Blackstone, which still owns just over half of Pinnacle following the food producer’s initial public offering early last year. Hillshire shares fell 3.2 per cent to $35.76.US equity markets rose on Monday despite rising tension in Ukraine over the weekend. There was little on the economic diary to drive stocks, as many investors waited for Tuesday’s retail sales report for an update on how the world’s largest economy has fared.“It just looks like the market is starting the week by completely placing geopolitical risks on the back burner,” said TD Securities strategist Gennadiy Goldberg.The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,896.65, a record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 16,695.47.

The move follows the Federal Communications Commission’s decision last December to review rules that have banned in-flight phone calls.Shares in Gogo weakened by 28.61 per cent to close at $13.12 while AT&T advanced about 1 per cent to $35.41.Sprint, the US mobile operator majority owned by Japan’s SoftBank, said its loss in the three months to March 31 narrowed to $151m, or 4 cents a share, from $643m a year earlier.The unprofitable carrier also reported revenue growth of 1 per cent to $8.88bn, ahead of Wall Street forecasts.“We continue to believe Sprint is taking many of the necessary steps to right the ship on a subscriber side,” Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said.“While this turn likely will not be seen until the second half, it is aligning its cost structure in such a way where we believe the higher end, if not higher, of its 2014 [earnings] guidance is achievable.”Following the company’s results, analysts at Jefferies said Sprint was also facing heightened pressure from smaller competitor T-Mobile, which now offers to pay cancellation fees for new subscribers switching from a rival operator.Shares in Sprint rose 11.31 per cent to $8.27 while T-Mobile advanced 3.38 per cent to end at $29.05. T-Mobile US will report quarterly results later this week.Merck, one of the largest US drugmakers, climbed after the company reported first-quarter results ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Sales at the company fell to $10.3bn in the first three months of the year from $10.7bn in the same period a year ago, as patents expired on several drugs.Profits for the quarter, though, edged higher to $1.7bn from $1.6bn as Merck tightened its cost control.The results come a day after Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser Group confirmed that it was in talks to buy the company’s consumer health business.“Investing in the best opportunities for growth while being disciplined in managing our costs enabled us to deliver bottom-line performance,” Kenneth Frazier, Merck’s chief executive, said.Shares in Merck rose 3.58 per cent to close at $58.71.Wet weather and the later-than-usual Easter exacerbated weakness in Coach’s North American business as strong demand in China failed to offset buyers’ fatigue in developed markets.Coach, the US maker of mid-range handbags and leather accessories, said net income fell by 20 per cent to $191m for the quarter ended in March while revenues dipped 7 per cent to $1.1bn.Analysts at Wells Fargo compared the decline in same-store sales in North America to results at JC Penney in 2012, when the department store attempted its own transformation.“While we do not view the Coach brand or product in the same light as JC Penney, the continuing challenges confronting JC Penney in its transformation are relevant when thinking about the timeline and challenges Coach may face as it attempts to bring in a new customer,” Wells Fargo analyst Paul Lejuez said.Overall, US equity markets regained steam after a turbulent Monday trading day, buoyed by earnings from some of the largest companies.Thus far, more than three-quarters of S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have either beaten or met Wall Street estimates.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.48 per cent to close at 1,878.33 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.53 per cent to 16,535.37. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.72 per cent to end the day at 4,103.54.
91;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2014-04-18T16:03:41Z;General Electric predicts healthy China growth;;General Electric, the US manufacturing and finance group, still expects healthy growth in China this year, in spite of mounting concerns about the country’s economy, its chief financial officer has said.Jeff Bornstein said GE expected its markets in China to grow faster than the economy as a whole, as it served areas that were priorities for the government, including healthcare and oil and gas production.“We still expect China to be a good source of growth for us for the rest of the year,” he told the Financial Times.GE’s industrial sales growth in China slowed sharply last year, from 20 per cent in 2012 to 7 per cent in 2013, and it suffered a 33 per cent drop in orders there for the first quarter of this year.However, Mr Bornstein said the pattern of orders was “very lumpy” because of the timing of bookings from aircraft manufacturers and oil companies, and the underlying picture was still showing robust growth, with orders for medical equipment up 13 per cent.GE does not expect to be much affected by the “mini-stimulus” announced by the government at the beginning of April, which was focused on areas such as railway lines and housing for low-income families, but believes it is in markets that were already set for strong growth.Speaking after GE reported earnings for the first quarter of 2014 that were slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations, Mr Bornstein said: “Based on our range of businesses, we should grow faster than the Chinese economy, and we have been.”Some other US companies have also been reporting that growth in China is still healthy. David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, the aerospace and automotive components company, told analysts on a call to discuss the company’s first-quarter earnings on Thursday that all of the company’s divisions “grew double-digits organically in China in the quarter.”Also on Thursday DuPont, the US chemicals group, expressed confidence in China as it reaffirmed its guidance that its earnings would grow by 8-15 per cent this year, in spite of taking a hit from higher natural gas costs in the first quarter caused by the cold weather in the US.Ellen Kullman, DuPont’s chief executive, told analysts that “a stable China” was one of the principal reasons for retaining that guidance.She added that there was “a lot of noise about China out there,” but DuPont “saw positives” from most of its divisions there, with businesses serving the automotive industry doing particularly well.
92;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2013-10-18T13:44:56Z;US defence spending cuts hit Honeywell sales;;Honeywell reported lower than expected third-quarter sales and trimmed its full-year revenue guidance as US defence and other spending cuts outweighed strong commercial aerospace and automotive sales.The industrial company, nevertheless, raised its guidance for full-year earnings per share, to a range of $4.90-$4.95 compared with $4.85-$4.95 previously, following a 4 per cent rise in third-quarter net income to $990m.However, Honeywell cut its projected sales to a range of $38.8bn to $39bn, down from $38.9bn to $39.3bn.Dave Cote, chief executive, blamed the sales decline on an 11 per cent fall in defence and space revenue, most of which comes from US government spending.“You’re all aware of the ongoing sequestration impact and the recent government shutdown,” he told investors. “While we’re expecting some level of recovery before the end of the year, we think the prudent approach is to conservatively adjust our aerospace sales outlet.”The company expected a “more muted” decline in defence in 2014, Mr Cote added.The lower-than-expected sales and Mr Cote’s downbeat comments sent the shares down 3 per cent to $84.06 by midday in New York.Third-quarter earnings per share rose 4 per cent to $1.26 compared with the same time last year, while net sales, despite the defence and space declines, rose 3 per cent to $9.65bn.Sales were also held back by a delay in the purchase of Intermec, a mobile computing company, which was completed on September 17.“Our short-cycle businesses, particularly energy, safety and security, and turbo technologies, are benefiting from improving end markets, new product introductions and geographic expansion, while our long-cycle businesses are maintaining a robust backlog, driven by favourable macro trends and strong win rates,” Mr Cote said.Despite the defence and space declines, segment profit – a measure of operating profits – for aerospace rose 3 per cent to $602m, on sales down 2 per cent to $2.97bn.Falling defence and space demand was partly offset by strong demand in commercial aerospace, where sales of new equipment rose 3 per cent on the same period last year and spare parts sales rose 5 per cent.In automation and control solutions, segment profits rose 11 per cent to $631m, on sales up 4 per cent to $4.13bn, mainly because of the beneficial effects for the energy, safety and security division of new house building and commercial building refits.Transportation systems’ segment profit rose 23 per cent to $128m, on sales up 6 per cent to $916m, on new vehicle launches amid strong US car sales and greater use of Honeywell’s turbo technology in engines.For 2014, Mr Cote said Honeywell was planning for a “continued slow growth macro environment”. But the company saw “a path to strong earnings growth” as a result of its “relentless seed planting in new products and technologies, continued penetration of high-growth regions and growing traction on key process initiatives”.
93;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T02:00:22+0000;Nest’s $129 smoke alarm is a Trojan horse for the connected home;;Nest, one of Silicon Valley’s best-known hardware startups, unveiled the follow-up to its “smart thermostat” on Tuesday: a talking smoke alarm that can send alerts to an app.The Nest Protect has already received praise for its slick design and imaginative touches, such as motion-sensing nightlights and a woman’s voice to warn more gently of rising smoke than the traditional buzzer. These are not features you often associate with a humble smoke alarm.With many fatalities resulting from fires in homes where the smoke alarm has run out of batteries or they’ve been removed because it went off at the wrong time, it may even have the potential to save lives.But one aspect has raised eyebrows – the $129 price tag. That’s more than four times the cost of the cheapest smoke and carbon-monoxide detectors.One obvious question is who would spend that much on a smoke alarm. A less obvious one is why Nest would want to sell one.“We love the unloved,” Matt Rogers, Nest’s co-founder, told the FT of the devices that it decides to make. “We are a details team, that’s kind of our Apple heritage.”In Silicon Valley at least, Nest has many devotees for that reason alone. Mr Rogers and his Apple alumnus co-founder, Tony Fadell, have poached so much talent from the iPhone maker that Steve Jobs once rang them up to complain.Nest is also expanding internationally, with its devices now gaining distribution in the UK. Mr Rogers won’t say exactly how many Nest thermostats have been sold to date but he says tens of thousands have been shipped through partnerships with energy companies. (It’s also doing well enough to have attracted some unwelcome attention from Honeywell, which accuses Nest’s thermostat of patent infringement.)Homes typically have several smoke alarms but just one thermostat, so Nest has a greater sales opportunity – for those prepared to spend hundreds of dollars on its products.Whether one device or many, the Nest Protect will live in the places people spend a lot of their time – in kitchens, bedrooms or hallways. “They are both in very key positions,” says Mr Rogers of the thermostat and smoke detector.That gives the company all sorts of options for further “smart home” applications down the road. As well as smoke and carbon monoxide sensors – and a humidity sensor (which might be useful for preventing false alarms due to hot showers, Mr Rogers says) – the Protect includes three activity sensors and an ambient light sensor.In a separate announcement last week, Nest said it would open up its application programming interface (API) to third-party developers for the first time. App makers, or Nest itself, might find alternative uses for those extra sensors, perhaps as a part of a security system or to notify family members of comings and goings.Mr Rogers sees the connected home emerging not in a kit from a DIY store but “grass roots”, as people devices that are useful in and of themselves, rather than trying to sell a “platform” vision of a futuristic Jetsons house.“There are virtually unlimited possibilities when you start connecting products together in the home,” says Mr Rogers. “The trick is finding those discrete uses as opposed to geekware. I don’t believe in buying a box of white plastic – that is not what we do. We believe in building products that are the best in their product category, but when you tie them together, it unlocks functionality that we never had before.”By that logic, if Nest Protect is to be a Trojan horse for the smart home, it must first convince customers that it’s worth $129 standalone. The device goes on sale before the end of the year.
94;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Airbus talks to Honeywell as beacon probe spreads;;Airbus, the commercial jet maker, has contacted the manufacturer of the beacons implicated in this month’s Heathrow Boeing 787 fire over the ramifications for its own aircraft, as concern over the beacons spreads.Airbus said it was not so far aware of any overheating incidents involving emergency locator transmitters on its aircraft.The manufacturer had nevertheless been in touch with Honeywell, the equipment’s US maker, to “ensure that any recommendations they may have . . . are taken into account as we review the ELT design and the component’s integration into Airbus aircraft,” it said.Airbus’s statement came after Boeing went beyond its previous call for operators of its 787s carrying Honeywell’s emergency locator transmitters to check the transmitters by asking operators of several other types to make the same inspections.The US’s Federal Aviation Administration warned operators of 787s on July 19 to inspect the wiring and wire routing on Honeywell-manufactured ELTs on the aircraft, to ensure there were no faults. Investigators suspect a fault with an ELT on the 787 led to a July 12 fire on an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft on the ground at London’s Heathrow airport.Boeing said on Sunday it was asking specific operators of 717, next-generation 737, 747-400, 767 and 777 aircraft to inspect those with the Honeywell fixed ELT. The transmitters are intended to help rescue workers locate an aircraft that has crashed or ditched in the sea.“The purpose of these inspections is to gather data to support potential rulemaking by regulators,” Boeing said.The UK’s Air Accident Investigation Branch initially recommended after the fire that all ELTs on Boeing 787s be disabled until the Heathrow fire’s cause had been discovered. The FAA stopped short of that, telling operators only to inspect the devices.The probe’s growing scope illustrates how concern over the beacons has switched attention away from the 787 – which was grounded for three months from January to April – towards the beacons’ general safety.Honeywell said it would continue to co-operate with all the agencies investigating the Boeing 787 fire.“Detailed analysis, inspections and testing are expected to continue for several months before the root cause is finally determined,” it said.The FAA did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would widen its instruction to inspect the devices beyond the 787.
95;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2013-07-20T01:39:57Z;US regulator tells airlines to inspect Dreamliner beacons;;The US air safety regulator has told airlines to inspect the wires around a transmitter implicated in a fire on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner on July 12, but stopped short of recommending the devices all be disabled.The Federal Aviation Administration was acting after the UK’s Air Accident Investigation Branch recommended that the emergency locator transmitters on board the aircraft be disabled while investigations continued into the fire, at London’s Heathrow airport.The location of the fire, on an Ethiopian Airlines 787 that had been on the ground for 10 hours, coincided with the location of the emergency locator transmitter, near the aircraft’s tail.The AAIB said a “thermal event” with such transmitters was “extremely rare”.But it added: “However …had this event occurred in flight, it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire.”The FAA said on Friday that it had reviewed the initial findings in the AAIB report and was working with Boeing to develop instructions to operators on how to inspect the devices. The transmitters help rescuers to locate an aircraft in the event of a crash.“These inspections would ask operators to inspect for proper wire routing and any signs of wire damage or pinching, as well as inspect the battery compartment for unusual signs of heating or moisture,” the FAA said.It was preparing an airworthiness directive that would make such inspections mandatory and would communicate its intention to aviation safety regulators elsewhere.Boeing said it had provided instructions to operators of the aircraft to ensure they met regulatory requirements.The transmitters are manufactured by Honeywell, which made no reference to the incident when it announced second-quarter results on Friday.The July 12 fire is the most serious incident involving a 787 since the fleet returned to service in April following a nearly four-month grounding in the wake of two serious overheating incidents involving the aircraft’s main batteries. There is no suggestion that the latest incident is connected with those incidents, following which Boeing substantially modified the batteries of the innovative aircraft to make it far harder for a fire to start.
96;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Cars and aerospace boost for Honeywell;;Honeywell increased its full-year guidance for the second time in two quarters on Friday, forecasting that commercial aerospace and automotive growth would help it keep withstanding the sluggish world economy.The diversified industrial group reported net income for the March to June quarter up 13 per cent to $1.02bn, on sales up 3 per cent to $9.69bn. Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to $1.28, in line with the company’s previous guidance.David Anderson, chief financial officer, said the results had put the company “another step closer” to achieving the high end of the $4.75 to $4.95 EPS range that it originally forecast for 2013. Having previously increased the low end of the range to $4.80 in April, the company increased it again to $4.85.“The environment has remained challenging, but Honeywell has continued to see strong execution supporting its results,” Mr Anderson said. “We’re not sitting on a big second-half recovery. We have seen pockets of short-cycle improvements.”In the aerospace division, segment profits – net income excluding financing, stock compensation and pension costs and one-off charges – improved 4 per cent to $583m, despite a 1 per cent decline in sales to $3bn. The sales decline reflected sharp falls in US defence-related business, which more than offset 5 per cent growth in commercial aerospace revenue.The company made no reference to the recommendation by UK air safety regulators that Boeing should disable emergency locator beacons manufactured by Honeywell for its 787 Dreamliner aircraft after a fire last Friday near such a transmitter.“While sequestration headwinds continue to be an issue for the segment, we still had a number of project starts in the quarter,” Mr Anderson said.The company also benefited from strong demand for its energy, safety and security products in its automation and control systems division, where segment profits grew 11 per cent to $585m, on sales up 3 per cent to $4.06bn.In transportation systems, segment profits grew 11 per cent to $126m, on sales up 5 per cent to $947m, as the company benefited from the growing popularity of its turbo technology in cars.Mr Anderson said growth in the segment for the year was likely to be only 2 to 4 per cent, as an expected 3 per cent decline in vehicle manufacturing in the European Union offset the effects of launches of new vehicles with turbo-boosted engines.The company had funded $100m of restructuring projects which would boost next year’s profitability, and had so far spent $70m.The shares rose 0.64 per cent to $83.50.
97;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2013-07-18T15:10:41Z;Investigators urge Dreamliner transmitters be disabled;;UK investigators probing a fire on a Boeing 787 have recommended that emergency locator beacons be disabled on all of the US manufacturer’s Dreamliner aircraft, to guard against a repetition of the recent blaze at London’s Heathrow airport.The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the US Federal Aviation Administration should take action to make “inert” the emergency locator transmitters on all 67 Dreamliners that are now in service with 12 airlines – a step achieved by removing the equipment’s battery.The AAIB has not yet reached a conclusion on what caused the fire on the Ethiopian Airlines’ Dreamliner at Heathrow last Friday, but investigators are focused on the transmitter– produced by Honeywell of the US – which is one means of locating aircraft when they get into difficulties.Last week’s fire is the most serious incident involving the Dreamliner since regulators temporarily grounded the 787 in January, after lithium-ion batteries on two aircraft overheated.The AAIB’s recommendation over the transmitters came shortly before a Japan Airlines 787 returned to Boston’s Logan Airport soon after take-off on Thursday. The airline’s website showed that the aircraft was returning for “maintenance”.There were unconfirmed reports that crew acted after a warning light came on in the cockpit. JAL did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Boeing referred inquiries to JAL. The aircraft landed safely back at Logan.There was no indication that the incident – the latest of many minor incidents to have affected the aircraft since it entered service – was connected to either a problem with the emergency transmitters or the aircraft batteries, which were implicated in two serious incidents in January that led to the entire fleet’s grounding.The European Aviation Safety Agency said the proposed deactivation of the Dreamliner’s emergency locator transmitter did not mean the aircraft would have to be grounded again – the jet could fly temporarily without it.The AAIB said the fire on the Ethiopian Airlines’ Dreamliner coincided with the location of the transmitter, in the upper part of fuselage, towards the tail.The transmitter is powered by a lithium manganese dioxide battery that the AAIB said had suffered some disruption to its cells – although it is not clear whether this device caused the fire.“The history of this [emergency locator transmitter] product line indicates that a thermal event is extremely rare,” said the AAIB in an interim report.“However …had this event occurred in flight, it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire.”The AAIB said the emergency locator transmitters should be disabled on all Dreamliners until any “airworthiness actions” are completed, which could potentially involve modifications to the equipment.It added that the FAA and other regulatory authorities should conduct a safety review of all transmitters that are powered by lithium batteries. This would involve several manufacturers and could affect many different aircraft types.Two people familiar with the situation said the Honeywell transmitters were fitted to some aircraft made by Airbus as well as Boeing.The FAA, which is assisting the AAIB with its investigation, said: “We are currently reviewing the AAIB’s report and recommendations to determine the appropriate action.”Boeing accepted the AAIB’s two recommendations, describing them as “reasonable precautionary measures”.Honeywell also supported the proposals and said it would “offer assistance to Boeing and the airlines if needed”.
98;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2013-07-16T12:03:22Z;Probe into Dreamliner fire at Heathrow views Honeywell part;;A component made by Honeywell, the US aerospace part manufacturer, is coming under scrutiny in an investigation into the fire on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow airport last Friday.Honeywell’s emergency locator transmitter – fitted to many aircraft, including the Dreamliner, enabling them to be found if they get into difficulties – is being examined by air accident investigators looking into the fire on the Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner.No conclusions have yet been reached by the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch on the cause of the fire on Boeing’s newest and most sophisticated passenger jet.The AAIB said: “We can confirm that Honeywell have been invited to join the investigation.“The emergency locator transmitter is one of several components being looked at in detail as part of the investigation and it would be premature to speculate on the causes of the incident at this stage.”The UK investigation is being assisted by officials from two US watchdogs – the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration – plus staff at the Ethiopian civil aviation authority.Honeywell confirmed the company had been “participating in the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787 fire investigation”, but said it was “far too premature to speculate on the cause”.It added: “Our [emergency locator transmitter] products have been certified by the FAA since 2005, are used on a number of aircraft models, and we’ve not seen nor experienced a single reported issue on this product line.” Boeing declined to comment.The fire on the Ethiopian Airlines Dreamliner broke out while the aircraft was empty and parked at a stand at Heathrow.The AAIB said on Saturday its preliminary work had found “extensive heat damage” to the upper part of the aircraft’s fuselage, towards the rear.Two people familiar with the situation said Honeywell’s emergency locator transmitter was powered by a lithium manganese battery that was non-rechargeable. This meant the equipment was self-contained, and did not rely on power from the aircraft’s electrical systems.The AAIB said in its Saturday statement that it had found no evidence suggesting the damage to the Dreamliner’s fuselage was caused by its lithium-ion batteries that are used in ground maintenance operations and for starting the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit.Lithium-ion batteries on two 787s burnt in January, prompting regulators to order a global grounding of the Dreamliner– the first such action against a single aircraft type for 34 years.At lunchtime in New York, Boeing’s shares were down 1.2 per cent at $104.40. The shares fell sharply on Friday on news of the fire but recovered much of this ground on Monday.All Nippon Airways, the largest operator of the Dreamliner, said on Tuesday it had conducted visual checks on the upper part of the 787 fuselage, towards the rear.It added the checks – which discovered nothing untoward – were done after the Japanese transport ministry contacted the airline.Japan Airlines, another Dreamliner operator, has also carried out fuselage inspections.
99;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2013-05-28T21:59:59Z;General Electric: industrial strength?;Removing extraneous elements of the finance business makes sense;Jeff Immelt wants General Electric to be an industrial company first. That may be the good news. Unfortunately, it has been the bad news too. Last week the GE chief executive elaborated on his plans to streamline GE Capital, the conglomerate’s financial arm. He said the company could do an initial public offering in lieu of asset sales of unwanted portions of the finance business. It is a canny move when the strength of equity markets is juxtaposed with a tepid M&A market. But with an emphasis on the industrial side of GE comes accountability, and accountability has so far meant underperformance – the shares are up 12 per cent this year while Honeywell and United Technologies are up 25 per cent and 16 per cent respectively.Still, removing the extraneous elements of GE Capital makes sense. The bits that lend to businesses face the same dynamics as the parent’s industrial businesses, while consumer lending, though lucrative, introduces unnecessary volatility. (The consumer segment makes up a quarter of GE Capital’s profit.) GE aspires to have the financial business accounting for only 30 per cent of group earnings. In the most recently completed quarter, however, weak results and outlook for the industrial business resulted in GE Capital contributing 40 per cent of earnings. And the shares responded to this industrial softness by falling 4 per cent. What is more, GE has set a long-term industrial organic growth target at 5 to 10 per cent, but expects this year to come in lower than that.Thus GE is doing what many big companies with weak revenues do: using dividends and share buybacks (it wants to reduce shares 10 per cent by 2015) to goose shareholder returns and hope the market gives it leeway to fix the top line. The trouble is that when rivals such as Honeywell deliver on sales and profits, investors tend to prefer those shares.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
100;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2013-04-23T19:30:58Z;US industrials: internally diverse;The unambiguous verdict from United Technologies is ambiguity;Consider United Technologies a tiebreaker on first-quarter earnings for diversified industrials companies. Last Thursday General Electric and Honeywell reported contrasting results. GE disappointed with greater than expected weakness from its power and water segment (revenue down 26 per cent) and offered pessimism about the remainder of the year. Honeywell was able to beat earnings expectations with strength across its segments, and slightly increased its view for the full year.The unambiguous verdict from UTC: ambiguity. Earnings per share were up 16 per cent as benefits from the $16.5bn acquisition of Goodrich started to flow through the income statement. But revenues came in light, as organic sales declined 2 per cent for the quarter (organic revenue was down 6 per cent at GE and 1 per cent at Honeywell).Diversified industrials are tricky to evaluate. They are internally diverse (UTC sells both lifts and jet engines) and each does things the others do not (Honeywell alone sells auto parts, for example). So what to watch as the year unfolds?Europe exposure will continue to drag (GE blamed Europe for poor results in power and water). China, even with “only” 7.5 per cent GDP growth, was a strong market for all three. Aerospace is a good place to be but on the commercial not the military side. The US airlines all project profitability this year and the global jet expansion cycle continues. In military aviation the US government sequestration hovers. UTC said sequestration could take as much as $0.10 out of earnings per share (tolerable, when EPS is expected to be around $6.00). Honeywell reduced its top line by 1 percentage point on the same basis. Execution has its own role to play, of course. And as the companies’ share performance in recent years suggests, Honeywell has the edge there.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
101;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Pratt & Whitney admits unit falsified test data;;A division of Pratt & Whitney, the aircraft engine maker, falsified test data for aircraft engine parts over 15 years, the company admitted, in the second case of wrongdoing in the past year to emerge at a subsidiary of United Technologies.Pratt & Whitney said an employee at its Carmel Forge facility in Israel submitted an anonymous allegation in June 2011 that test data for parts had been falsified. An investigation showed the data had been “altered” to minimise the risk of further testing, the company said.Revelation of the problems at Carmel Forge follows the guilty plea last June by Pratt & Whitney Canada and Hamilton Sundstrand, a US-based sister company, to illegally supplying China with attack helicopter technology. Both Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sunstrand are subsidiaries of United Technologies, the diversified industrial group.Pratt & Whitney said it had carried out “thorough internal audits” using the original, unaltered test data to confirm the quality of the parts in question. “There have been no product recalls, service bulletins, or airworthiness directives, and there are no flight safety risks.”Carmel Forge makes parts for turbines for both aeroengines and some on-land applications. It supplies other aircraft engine suppliers, including General Electric and Honeywell, as well as its parent company.The Carmel Forge factory had notified its customers of the problems, while Pratt & Whitney had notified the Federal Aviation Administration and Defence Contract Management Agency, Pratt & Whitney said.Carmel Forge had made “personnel changes”, implemented robust software controls, purchased new test equipment and taken other steps to prevent any adjustments to original test data in future.“Carmel Forge remains confident in the quality, integrity and safety of its products,” Pratt & Whitney said.The falsification came to light in a report in the Wall Street Journal.General Electric did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Honeywell said it was working with its suppliers to review all materials.In June last year, United Technologies agreed to a fine of $75m over the illegal exports to China. The exports came about after employees at Pratt & Whitney Canada supplied sensitive engines and control technology to a Chinese helicopter programme that they had described internally as a commercial transport helicopter. The project in fact aimed to build China’s first attack helicopter.Pratt & Whitney said the Carmel Forge falsification was a “single instance” of wrongdoing when the “vast, overwhelming majority” of Pratt & Whitney’s 35,000 worldwide employees did the right thing at all times.“It’s inexcusable, and it’s unacceptable,” it said. “However, it is not indicative of the culture at Pratt & Whitney.”
102;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2013-02-25T23:08:54Z;Chiefs call for US energy policy shake-up;;The US needs a comprehensive energy strategy to boost its economic competitiveness, a group of leading chief executives said on Monday, laying out a plan to become self-sufficient and boost growth.The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing the US’s blue-chip corporations, said in its “Taking Action on Energy” report that uncertainty over energy policy was hampering investment in everything from wind power to oil drilling.“Energy is critical to America’s economic vitality and getting energy policy right could mean faster income and job growth today, and improved living standards for future generations of Americans,” said David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell International and head of the BRT’s energy committee.“It’s clear to us that North American energy self-sufficiency is within reach, but the US doesn’t have a strategy to leverage our advantages and create a more affordable, more secure and more sustainable energy future for all Americans,” Mr Cote told reporters on Monday.John Watson, chief executive of Chevron, the oil group, said the country was “poised to regain its status as an energy superpower”.“The dramatic rise in US oil and natural gas production is creating jobs and economic growth across America, but our ability to take full advantage of the historic opportunity in front of us depends upon the right policy framework,” he said.The unexpected shale oil and gas boom is one of the few bright spots in the US economy. The International Energy Agency projects that the US will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world’s largest global oil producer by 2020 and could be almost self-sufficient in energy by 2035.As a result of the shale revolution, the Obama administration, after promoting renewable energy early in its first term, has now adopted an “all of the above” policy encompassing fossil fuels.Energy companies are eagerly awaiting signs of how President Barack Obama will proceed in his second term. They are calling on him to approve the Keystone XL pipeline designed to carry oil from Canada’s tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico, and view this as a litmus test of the president’s willingness to be more supportive of traditional energy sources.Environmentalists, who resolutely oppose Keystone, are pressing Mr Obama to apply tough new emissions standards to new, as well as existing, coal-fired power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions.In its 76-page report, the Business Roundtable laid out a plan to foster innovation and increase energy efficiency, as well as improve access to energy resources by opening up onshore and offshore federal lands for coal, oil and gas production.The report also said that the Environmental Protection Agency – the federal unit that has been the bane of energy companies’ existence – should base its regulations “on sound science” and “take into consideration the net cumulative impact these regulations have on energy costs, economic growth and job creation”.Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical, said that “overly complex and costly regulations” had been a major impediment to growth and had taken “a particularly heavy toll on energy exploration and production”.The chief executives urged an end to the policy uncertainty affecting everything from production tax credits for renewable energy projects – the result of the fiscal debates on Capitol Hill – to nuclear and coal plants awaiting regulatory rulings.
103;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Honeywell flies on aerospace demand;;Booming aerospace demand amid record worldwide airliner orders helped to push up full-year net income at Honeywell, the diversified industrial group, by 41 per cent to $2.93bn, despite declining US defence spending.Honeywell, based in New Jersey, also benefited substantially from a 46 per cent fall to $957m in the annual charge for marking its pension assets down to market value. The profits were struck on revenue up 3 per cent to $37.7bn.Full-year segment profits at the aerospace division grew 13 per cent to $2.28bn, on sales up 5 per cent to $12bn. The growth in segment profits – a pre-tax profit measure that excludes financing and pension costs – was in spite of a 6 per cent decline in fourth-quarter sales in aerospace’s defence and space businesses.Continuing strong demand in commercial aerospace nevertheless pushed fourth-quarter segment profits in aerospace up 5 per cent to $601m, on sales down 1 per cent to $3.02bn.Dave Anderson, Honeywell’s chief finance officer, said the company was benefiting from the record backlogs of commercial aircraft orders from major suppliers such as Boeing and Airbus but also from growing spare part demand as aircraft flew more.“We’re looking forward to continued flight-hour growth for 2013,” Mr Anderson said.The company forecast growth in 2013 earnings per share (EPS) before pension mark-to-market adjustments of 6 to 11 per cent, to a $4.75 to $4.95 range. EPS for 2012 rose 11 per cent to $4.48 before the pension effect, but rose 41 per cent to $3.69 on an unadjusted basis.Honeywell – whose chief executive Dave Cote has been one of the corporate leaders most vocal about the need to resolve the US’s public finance problems– has been more sober than many other companies about the prospects for the defence business.Mike Madsen, head of the company’s defence business, told investors in November that, while he expected the US to avoid severe, across-the-board “sequestration” spending cuts, he still expected spending far lower than foreseen in President Obama’s budget request.Other military contractors have prepared their 2013 financial forecasts on the basis of the budget request.In the company’s weakest segment, transport systems, full-year segment profits fell 11 per cent to $432m, on sales down 8 per cent to $3.56bn. The company blamed the decline on falling production in the recession-hit European motor industry.Mr Anderson said Honeywell was adjusting its European production schedules to cope with the slowdown in demand. But it was also bearing in mind that the business, which specialises in supplying turbochargers, would grow in the long term as more vehicles used turbochargers.The shares were up 0.13 per cent to $68.33 at the close in New York.
104;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T02:00:22+0000;Honeywell defence chief backs sector cuts;;The head of the defence business of Honeywell, one of the US’s biggest industrial conglomerates, has broken ranks with his peers and called deep defence cuts inevitable and “the right thing”.Mike Madsen told listeners to the company’s defence and space investor day conference call on Monday that Honeywell took an unusual position on the looming cuts.The company expected legislators and the Obama administration to agree a deal averting the fiscal cliff – spending reductions and tax increases due to come into force from the start of the new year.The fiscal cliff cuts – agreed last year as part of a deal to raise the US’s debt ceiling – would cut spending on most defence programmes by about 10 per cent.However, Honeywell expected a compromise agreement still to lower spending by about 80 per cent of the fiscal cliff level. “We’re not really trying to push this back,” Mr Madsen said.The Aerospace Industry Association, the trade lobby group for military contractors, has argued strongly against cuts, arguing that the US faces multiple international security threats and must be prepared.However, Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive, has been one of the most prominent industry voices in the Fix The Debt campaign calling for a deal to narrow the US’s budget deficit sharply.Honeywell expects to generate sales of roughly $5.1bn this year in defence and space. The company provides mainly control, propulsion and other subsystems for major military programmes such as military helicopters, transport aircraft and the F22 joint strike fighter.Honeywell recognised significant cuts would be made, Mr Madsen said. “They need to occur,” he said. “That’s the right thing to happen, actually.”However, Mr Madsen said it would be better if they happened more “surgically” than would be the case under fiscal cliff cuts.They would cut spending equally on large army programmes such as tanks – which many observers think could safely be significantly reduced – and budgets for naval programmes useful for any future war in the Pacific.Mr Madsen said that given the near-ending of US involvement in Iraq and the draw-down of US forces from Afghanistan, spending on land forces was likely to fall.“I think money that’s tied to a long duration on-the-ground sort of campaign will continue to decline from current levels,” he said.However, spending would continue, and potentially increase, on the kind of equipment the US tended to buy before the 9/11 attacks led it towards a decade of war, he went on.“We’re already seeing indications that spending on enduring platforms – the carriers, the bombers, long-range strike capability, as well as security spend across the [government] not just in the Department of Defence – it’s actually going to continue to ramp up a bit.”
105;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-11-18T22:56:46Z;Skilled workers shortfall of 40m forecast;;High-tech companies face a shortfall of some 40m skilled workers by 2020, with businesses based in China likely to be among the worst hit, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.The institute – a research arm of the McKinsey strategy consultancy – says that manufacturing will be the sector of the global economy that will be most severely affected.The specific difficulties that McKinsey foresees for China indicates that the country – which took over from the US last year as the world’s biggest manufacturing country by output – may have trouble continuing its fast rate of expansion in this sector.Parts of manufacturing likely to suffer the most through the recruitment difficulties include the motor, medical equipment and aerospace sectors.The impact of the skills shortages in such industries is likely to worsen in the next few years, due to the failure by academic institutions to train enough people to high enough standards to keep pace with demand, said James Manyika, a director of the institute.“The extent of the skills deficit will be a huge constraint on the ability of many companies to develop their businesses in the way they want,” said Mr Manyika.In the McKinsey study, a high-skilled person is defined as someone who has gained a university degree or equivalent qualification – irrespective of discipline.However, the areas of expertise where employers are experiencing the worst problems in recruitment are in technical subjects highly relevant to manufacturing and other technology-based sectors including mining, hospital services and engineering design.Among large companies that have recently acknowledged they face difficulties recruiting sufficient people in fields such as engineering are the US industrial groups Boeing, Caterpillar and Honeywell and Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine supplier.Of the 40m of unfilled vacancies for skilled workers that are projected by McKinsey to be evident by 2020, an estimated 13m are likely to be in manufacturing businesses, with the rest split up between a large number of other parts of the world economy.According to the McKinsey consultants, China is likely to be the single country that suffers the most through a shortage of skilled workers.By 2020, China will have an excess of demand for these people of some 22m.The remaining 18m shortfall will have an impact largely in the advanced industrialised regions – mainly western Europe, the US and Japan – according to the study’s authors.McKinsey reckons that China’s specific problems stem from the economy growing so quickly that – in spite of the large numbers of people with high educational qualifications coming out of universities and colleges – the output of these men and women is unable to keep up with expanding requirements.By 2020, according to McKinsey, businesses based in China will require a total of 140m people with high skills – some 22m fewer than the numbers with the appropriate qualifications who will be available for these jobs.This is in spite of the expectation that Chinese universities and equivalent academic institutions will produce some 5m graduates a year over the next few years in all disciplines.“China is putting a lot of resources into education. But even so this is not enough to meet the requirements of an economy that, even if it has slowed down somewhat, is still expanding extremely fast [at 7-8 per cent a year] by the standards of most countries,” Mr Manyika said.Another difficulty for China stems from the changing balance of its population, with the ratio of old to young people growing rapidly.As a result, the numbers of people in their 20s entering the workforce – and potentially with high levels of education – are likely to be relatively small over the next few years relative to the country’s population.
106;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-10-19T21:32:12Z;Manufacturers warn of ‘fiscal cliff’ threat;Economic conditions described as “challenging”;General Electric and Honeywell, two of the largest American manufacturers, have reported robust results from their industrial businesses but warned of the threat posed by the approaching “fiscal cliff”: the possibility of steep tax rises and spending cuts taking effect in the US at the end of the year.Both companies described global economic conditions as “challenging” but said they were continuing to increase their earnings through cost cutting and margin improvements.They both raised concerns about the gridlock in Washington over budget policy. Dozens of tax cuts and allowances will expire and spending cuts will be triggered automatically from January 1 unless Congress can reach a deal.GE, the largest US industrial group by market capitalisation, reported a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits and earnings in line with analysts’ expectations but surprised with slower than expected growth in revenues. It also cut its guidance of revenue growth for the full year to 3 per cent, from a previous projection of 5 per cent.The news hit the company’s shares, which closed down 3.4 per cent at lunchtime in New York at $22.03.However, Keith Sherin, the company’s chief financial officer, said the slower revenue growth was a result of GE Capital, the finance division, shrinking faster than previously planned, as the group worked to reduce its reliance on financial services. “We feel that we’ve had a pretty good quarter,” he said.Adjusted earnings per share, excluding pension costs, were in line with forecasts at $0.36, up an underlying 13 per cent. The group also reiterated its guidance that it expected double-digit earnings growth for the year as a whole.Jeff Immelt, chief executive, pointed to the company’s success in increasing margins at its industrial businesses by 0.7 percentage points compared with the third quarter of 2011 – a feat that some analysts had expected would be difficult given the slowdown in the world economy.While several companies have been warning of weaker demand in emerging economies, GE said revenues in its “growth market” businesses were up 9 per cent, with double-digit growth in China, Africa and Latin America.Mr Sherin warned, however, that the fiscal cliff could have a large effect on the US. “It affects us the same as everyone else,” he said. “We hope it can be resolved with bipartisan work, for the good of the country and the world.”Honeywell, which makes aircraft systems, components and controls, stuck with its central estimate for full-year earnings, in spite of a near halt to sales growth, as it raised its forecast profit margins.Dave Anderson, chief financial officer, said the company’s “formula” was working “in an otherwise challenging environment”.However, he also warned that the potential “fiscal cliff” presented risks to demand. Mr Anderson said he hoped to see politicians “applying some intelligence” to resolving the issue.
107;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-10-19T18:04:44Z;Honeywell foresees better profit margin;;Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, improved its guidance for its full-year profit margin despite a near-halt to sales growth in the latest evidence of how corporate earnings are growing despite worldwide economic uncertainty.The company, which is benefiting from exposure to fast-growing civil aircraft production and oil and gas activity, said it expected its operating margin for the year to be between 13.5 and 13.7 per cent, against 13.4 to 13.6 per cent previously. It narrowed its guidance on likely earnings per share to $4.45 to $4.50, from $4.40 to $4.55 before.However, the company trimmed its guidance for full-year revenues to $37.5bn to $37.7bn from a range of $37.8bn to $38.4bn.It altered its guidance after announcing net income in the third quarter up 10 per cent to $950m on net sales virtually unchanged at $9.34bn. Earnings per share improved 9 per cent to $1.20.Dave Anderson, chief financial officer, said the company was experiencing “softness” in its automation and control solutions business, and performance materials. Both were nevertheless succeeding in improving their margins.“It’s not really affecting the bottom line of the company,” Mr Anderson said of the weak conditions in the two markets. “It’s really affecting the end market conditions.”The weakest results were in the transportation systems business, where segment profits fell 14 per cent to $104m on sales down 10 per cent to $863m. The falls were mainly the result of a 9 per cent fall in European vehicle production as well as weakness in China.The business nevertheless remained an attractive one for Honeywell, Mr Anderson insisted. The company had benefited from success in selling its systems for new products, Mr Anderson said.“Europe will come back,” he added.In the strongest-performing business – aerospace – segment profits improved 9 per cent to $582m, on sales up 4 per cent to $3.04bn. The business benefited both from the use of Honeywell equipment in a number of new aircraft being produced to replace ageing worldwide aircraft fleets as well as from its exposure to after-market servicing of aircraft, Mr Anderson said.That profitability growth is likely to continue in the new year, the company said. In preliminary guidance, it said aerospace margins were likely to improve to 18.8 per cent for 2013 and also forecast improved margins in performance materials and automation and control systems. Margins in transportation systems, however, were forecast to decline slightly to 12.4 per cent.Mr Anderson expressed some concern that the “fiscal cliff” of combined tax increases and spending cuts threatened in the US in the new year could impact demand for the company’s products. He called on politicians to work collaboratively to avoid a crisis.Honeywell’s shares rose 1.9 per cent to $62.59.
108;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-10-04T19:09:00Z;CEOs missing in action in US fiscal battle;Bond wobble could focus minds on helping solve deadlock;"Last year I listened to Erskine Bowles, the wisecracking Democrat who has campaigned for bipartisan fiscal reform, throw down a gauntlet to American business. Speaking to an audience of corporate executives, at Harvard Business School, Mr Bowles begged them to support his efforts to forge a practical deal – and argued that this corporate voice was crucial to breaking Washington gridlock.In the event, the appeal fell on deaf ears; chief executives have been missing in action (MIA) – or missing from the political fiscal action– in the past year. True, some figures, such as David Cote, head of Honeywell, have spoken out. But this is rare; instead of pushing for a grand bargain, most executives have grumbled about political gridlock on earnings calls.But could this finally be about to change? That is the intriguing question being asked in both New York and Washington. And it is an issue investors would do well to watch. For as the election heats up, a quiet new initiative has recently got under way to co-opt those MIA corporate leaders into the fiscal fight.Most notably, under the framework of a group known as The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – led by people such as Maya MacGuineas with the spiritual leadership of Mr Bowles and Alan Simpson – Washington and Wall Street players are trying to persuade those CEOs to support a campaign for bipartisan action. So far, about 100 CEOs have signed up, including Jamie Dimon (of JPMorgan), Lloyd Blankfein (of Goldman Sachs), Jeff Immelt (of General Electric), and Mr Cote himself. Pete Peterson, the former private equity guru and long-time champion of fiscal reform, is providing broad support too. The group has raised more than $30m and expects to raise more, to fund lobbying and public debate, via conferences, advertisements and social media (Mr Bowles, as it happens, is on the Facebook board.)But it is unclear just how effective this new drive will be. After all, last year’s appeal notably ran into the sand. But what is perhaps most interesting – and telling – is what the campaign’s strategy suggests about the possible future path of fiscal action. Most notably, these 100-odd business leaders apparently have little hope that anyone can strike a grand fiscal bargain before December 31 (or when the US is slated to fall off that fiscal cliff); Republicans and Democrats are too far apart in rhetoric, and the issues too complex, to get the details settled in the lame duck session after the November 6 vote.So, instead, the campaign is preparing a two-pronged line of attack. Between November 6 and December 31, business leaders will push for a preliminary deal, which would delay that dangerous end-of-year fiscal squeeze – in exchange for a bipartisan commitment to honour some basic goals, such as an overall deficit reduction target, or rough balance of spending and revenue measures. The idea is that this will create breathing space, but also keep the markets calm. Then, in the first six months of next year, there will be a serious drive to hammer out a grandiose fiscal plan. For by then, it should be easier to turn the vague commitments into a tangible package, since the balance of the new government will be clear and the public deeply familiar with the issues. Or so the argument goes.Could this work? As strategies go, it certainly sounds sensible. And after listening to this week’s presidential debate, it is not impossible to imagine this two-part scheme falling into place. For while President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney threw plenty of mud at each others’ plans, both also referred back to the initial fiscal deal proposed by the Bowles-Simpson fiscal committee two years ago; moreover, they did so without overt hostility.But the devil – as so often – is in the detail: or, more specifically, what the ideological balance of the next Congress will be, and where the faultlines on defence spending and tax increases, say, lie. And perhaps the biggest single obstacle to success is that markets – like those CEOs – have remained so quiet. A few decades ago, Democratic strategist James Carville famously observed that if he were reincarnated he would want to be the bond market since that can “intimidate everybody”. But these days, with 10-year Treasury yields at 1.7 per cent, the US bond market is not creating any terror, or even a sense of urgency.If Mr Bowles really wants to get CEOs and congressmen moving, in other words, he does not just need a Facebook page; he could do with a “goldilocks” bond wobble too (ie a jolt just big enough to concentrate minds, but not so fierce that it causes real financial pain). But don’t bet on that happening soon; or not, at least, while Europe is writhing in pain, and the Fed keeps gobbling up Treasury bonds on an eye-popping scale.gillian.tett@ft.com"
109;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-09-28T20:13:17Z;Boom and burst in outer space;Gravitational waves, ripples in space-time first predicted by Einstein, are one of the most sought-after targets in astronomy;Many astronomers like nothing more than detecting mysterious explosions in deep space and then explaining the prodigious amounts of energy released. These explanations, for example of the processes involved in supernovae, have contributed much to our knowledge of physics.The latest mystery concerns incredibly powerful bursts of radiowaves, apparently originating from the distant universe and lasting just a few milliseconds. Astronomers say they may represent entirely new phenomena such as a catastrophic collision between two neutron stars or even the death throes of an evaporating black hole.A team led by Duncan Lorimer of the University of West Virginia discovered the first such radio burst in 2007. The Lorimer Burst, as it was called, intrigued astronomers but, as it seemed to be a one-off event, they gradually lost interest. One analysis suggested that the radiowaves actually originated in Earth’s atmosphere, through the electrical effects of distant lightning, rather than outer space.But this year two other groups of astronomers have discovered similar super-bright, super-distant radio bursts – one still unpublished. So the Lorimer Burst is no longer a one-off curiosity, and speculation about the cause has flared up again among astronomers, though it has not yet reached the mass media.“Now that we have three sources I think we can say more confidently that they’re something completely new,” says Lorimer. “Whatever they are, they must come from relatively small objects because they last for such a short time.” Radiowaves from an object more than a few hundred kilometres in diameter would be spread out over a longer period than a few milliseconds.All three bursts were detected in data from the Parkes Observatory in Australia. Its location and design make this radiotelescope well suited for radio surveys of the sky.Although the bursts seem to arise in the universe far beyond our Milky Way galaxy, “there are many mysteries to unravel” about their origins, says Evan Keane of the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy in Germany, who led the discovery of the second burst.Psychopaths tend to have an impaired sense of smell, which points to inefficient processing in the brain, according to a study at Macquarie University, Australia.For a start, astronomers need to know whether the radiation from each burst is concentrated into radiowaves or whether the intensity spreads right across the electromagnetic spectrum. Although there are no records of simultaneous energy bursts from observatories looking at other wavelengths, such as visible light or gamma rays, absence of evidence in astronomy definitely does not mean evidence of absence.“Remember that astronomers are far from being able to keep an eye on the whole sky the whole time,” says Tim O’Brien, associate director of Jodrell Bank Observatory near Manchester. “It is still hard to detect transient events, though new instruments are being designed that will make it easier in future.”The total energy output from a Lorimer Burst is hard to estimate. It may represent the universe’s most concentrated violence, in terms of energy generated in a particular unit of space and time, since the Big Bang. Although supernovae, the most powerful stellar explosions, release much more energy, this takes place over a longer period and larger volume of space.The most intriguing possible explanation for the burst is a final pulse of radiation from an evaporating black hole. Black holes are concentrations of mass so dense that not even light can escape their intense gravity, but, as Stephen Hawking showed by quantum mechanical calculation in the 1970s, they can nonetheless radiate energy – a process that may end with the black hole disappearing in a cataclysmic pop.A less exotic possibility is the collision and merger between two ultra-dense neutron stars, which would also release a staggering amount of electromagnetic energy in a very small space.Either an evaporating black hole or a colliding pair of neutron stars would be a powerful emitter of gravitational waves. These ripples in space-time, first predicted by Einstein, are one of the most elusive and sought-after targets in astronomy. “The bursts could be a beacon for people searching for gravity waves,” says Lorimer.A new generation of more powerful radiotelescopes with a wider field of view is due to come online over the next decade, culminating in a project called the Square Kilometre Array, with receiving dishes spread across the southern hemisphere. These will help astronomers detect and follow up transient events much more effectively than they can today. By 2020 they should have gone a long way to solving the mystery of the Lorimer Bursts.……………………………………………………………..Helping pilots weather the stormHow often do you feel frustrated by flight delays? asks Ling Ge. According to the US Federal Aviation Administration, weather causes 70 per cent of delays. Indeed, bad weather poses big challenges for the aerospace industry. Severe weather, such as turbulence, lightening and hail, may even injure or kill passengers. So an accurate depiction of weather conditions ahead of an aircraft is critical to a safe and comfortable flight.Honeywell, the US-based technology firm, has developed an advanced 3D weather radar that helps pilots to avoid damaging storms and turbulence, therefore making air travel safer and more cost-effective. The new system is called IntuVue (meaning “intuitive view”).Conventional weather radar is located in the aircraft nose and works by sending out a flat, horizontal microwave beam in front of the plane. The way the signals bounce back shows what clouds, rain, snow or hail lie ahead. The pilots see a two-dimensional slice of sky in their displays and need to tilt the radar beam up or down manually to sample a different slice of the sky.However, a storm is three-dimensional in nature, so pilots’ prediction of weather ahead depends partly on guesswork and is subject to human error. Dangerous weather is tracked by more sophisticated ground radar and satellites as well, but processing such information from air-traffic controllers while choosing an optimal flight path can be a challenging task for pilots.IntuVue’s innovation lies in the “volumetric buffer”, which removes the uncertainty by tilting rapidly and automatically like a ground radar, painting a detailed picture of the weather ahead in three dimensions. It predicts with 93 per cent confidence where severe weather is hiding. For the first time, pilots are able to see slices of weather at any altitude they want.This requires huge amounts of data processing, which the IntuVue weather computer does in real time. Pilots no longer have to operate the beam by hand, they have less work to do interpreting the data and they see a more complete view of the sky ahead.The hail and lightning prediction feature only became commercially available this summer. The onboard computer uses advanced meteorological algorithms to predict hail and lightning from the radar reflections. Relevant areas of severe weather are highlighted on the cockpit display to help pilots navigate a safe path.The IntuVue radar is available on a range of commercial aircraft and business jets.Looking into the future, Honeywell engineer Ratan Khatwa foresees a merger of IntuVue with the company’s SmartView technology, which allows pilots to “see” the world outside the aircraft as a kind of virtual reality.It will never be possible for pilots to avoid all turbulence – and weather-related delays will always be a risk of air travel – but new technology promises to reduce their incidence.
110;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-09-10T18:33:36Z;US companies gloomy about earnings growth;;"Corporate America is more pessimistic about the prospects for short-term earnings growth than at any time since the start of the financial crisis, as a slowing global economy weighs on demand for US companies’ goods and services.Even as the US stock market hit a four-year high, year-on-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 slowed to just 0.8 per cent in the second quarter while the consensus forecast among analysts is for growth to turn negative in the current quarter for the first time in three years.Companies are even more downbeat. During the latest reporting season S&P 500 groups were three times more likely to say they would miss analysts’ expectations of third-quarter earnings than beat them. That was the worst guidance ratio since the final quarter of 2008, immediately after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Historically, we have only seen numbers like this during times of recession,” said Christine Short, who tracks earnings at S&P Capital IQ. “It tells you something about how American executives see the world.”Several leading US companies have been warning of their vulnerability to a global economic slowdown with the eurozone on the edge of recession and deteriorating data in China.Manufacturer Honeywell saw a contraction of growth in its short-cycle businesses of orders for immediate delivery in Europe and China in the second quarter.Chief executive David Cote bemoaned a “challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe” as he issued a third-quarter forecast that only just met analysts’ expectations.Twenty-four technology companies have guided expectations below analysts’ previous forecasts for the third quarter, including Apple, whose chief executive Tim Cook said flat performance in Europe had “really hampered our total results”.Other blue-chip US companies have been scaling back guidance issued to investors just a few months ago.On Friday, chipmaker Intel lowered its forecast for third-quarter revenue by almost 8 per cent from its July estimate, blaming “weaker than expected demand”.Three days earlier FedEx, the express delivery company, cut earnings guidance for its recently completed quarter by 8 per cent from its June forecast, pointing to “weakness in the global economy”.Sales outside the US account for almost a third of revenues of S&P 500 companies, while in the technology sector the figure is over 50 per cent, according to FactSet.Since the financial crisis, US companies have prospered despite patchy global growth, with those on the S&P 500 reporting eight consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth from the end of 2009, largely as a result of cost-cutting.But with margins now near record levels but showing little sign of further growth, US companies need increased sales to drive further profit increases.“Flat margins mean that earnings will be driven by revenue growth,” David Kostin, chief equity strategist at Goldman Sachs told clients last week. “[But] macro headwinds should persist, constraining revenues through 2013.”Consensus estimates are for S&P 500 earnings growth to rebound in the fourth quarter and into 2013, although some analysts are now reassessing those forecasts too.According to S&P Capital IQ, 72 companies in the S&P 500 said third-quarter earnings will miss consensus analyst expectations, the most since the third quarter of 2009. Just 22 S&P 500 companies said they expect to beat analyst forecasts this year, the fewest since the company started collecting data in 2006.Nearly 400 companies did not offer any guidance at all, suggesting uncertainty about future growth prospects, the most since the third quarter of 2009.

This piece has been modified since first publication to reflect the fact that the top end of Honeywell’s guidance of $1.10 to $1.15 in third-quarter earnings per share met the consensus analyst forecast of $1.15."
111;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
112;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;US industrial groups partner for training;;Jeff Owens recalls how he used to become frustrated with the mismatch between the entry-level workers he was seeking and the skills of young people leaving high school or college.“People coming out of high school just don’t have the skills necessary to work in this industry,” says the chief executive of Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include Caterpillar and Honeywell.“They have to have skills around hydraulics, electronics, computers, software,” Mr Owens says. “Community colleges were not training to the level we needed for our world – machine maintenance. They were training for welders, for machine operators. Our focus is on the guys who service and repair the machines.”Mr Owens established an in-house apprentice programme, but he says it was expensive to run and young people were put off by the fact that it did not earn them college credits.Then he approached a local state-funded community college, proposing that they jointly develop a curriculum.From an initial 20 graduates five years ago, the two-year programme has grown to 60 people. Some 200 alumni have gone on to work for ATS.Mr Owens’s staff serve as adjunct professors and he gives scholarships to the children and grandchildren of employees and customers, paying their tuition fees and offering work experience.While larger groups can afford in-house training schemes, small and medium-sized US industrial companies facing a lack of qualified young workers are increasingly taking the situation in to their own hands and forming partnerships with educational institutions to train workers with the skills they need.Only one in five employers use training and development programmes to fill the skills gap internally, while only 6 per cent team up with outside educational programmes, a recent survey by Manpower Group has found.“The bottom line for youth employment is that companies’ proactive talent management strategies must include recruiting potentially trainable workers, including young people and investing in training these individuals in the specific skills needed to deliver a business strategy,” the report, Wanted: Energised, career-driven youth, said.Such partnerships are still unusual, however. Although 93 per cent of manufacturers said they faced some kind of skills shortage, in a survey last year by the Manufacturing Institute, an industry body, only 14 per cent are working with technical and community colleges. But the institute’s Jennifer McNelly says the numbers are increasing. “We are seeing it become part of the solution,” she says.While Mr Owens’s company is large enough to support its own programme, smaller manufacturers are clubbing together to attract and train young people in the skills they are looking for.Michael Araten, chief executive of Rodon, a small plastic injection moulding manufacturer near Philadelphia with 100 staff and an annual turnover of more than $20m, formed a consortium of 50 local manufacturers two years ago. It approached local technical schools, described the skills its members needed and pledged to offer jobs to graduates where possible.The programme now trains up to 20 young people a year. Because the manufacturers all have specific needs, Mr Araten says the aim is as much about marketing manufacturing to young people as developing particular skills. “We didn’t change their curriculum,” he says. “It was more to get the message out that there are jobs here in the marketplace.”Some companies have gone even further to show young people the kinds of job manufacturing offers. Tailored Label Products, of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, has turned part of its factory into a classroom for teenagers who are struggling at high school or have dropped out. The company, which has 75 employees, makes labels for customers including Rockwell Automation and Eaton.The students learn in the classroom for two hours a day and spend six hours a day working at businesses in the area. It is a programme that contradicts mainstream thinking that schools should simply prepare people for university, says Tracy Tenpenny, vice-president of Tailored Label Products.The focus on four-year college degrees is a perennial gripe of US industrial companies, many of which argue that technical training would better serve young people when they come to look for employment.According to Ms McNelly, many college courses that offer training for manufacturing jobs are not actually helping, because they are not designed in consultation with industry. “A lot of people go through manufacturing education but are they achieving industry certifications? Not all are right now,” she says.In response, the Manufacturing Institute has developed its own national credential to teach a set of standard competencies for industrial jobs. The US federal government is encouraging companies to train young people, asking them to commit to taking on a certain number. More than 300,000 commitments have been secured this year, says Adriana Kugler, chief economist at the Department of Labor.Many employers balk at the idea of the government setting standards for skills education, saying that should be left to industry. However, many also say the government could do more to push basic science, mathematics and engineering skills.Ultimately, manufacturers hope that by demonstrating to young people the career choices available, they can foster more interest in acquiring the relevant skills. “The education system is measured on how well we can get kids to college,” says Mr Tenpenny. “There’s no room in the system for kids who aren’t going to college. That has to change.”
113;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-08-01T18:20:55Z;Europe and Asia weakness dents US revenues;;US corporate revenue growth slowed considerably in the second quarter due to weakness in Europe and Asia and a strong dollar.While the US economy is growing at a sluggish 1.5 per cent with unemployment still stuck above 8 per cent, most companies missing revenue estimates blamed Europe’s fiscal crisis and austerity measures as well as stuttering growth in emerging markets, notably Asia and Latin America.The consensus estimate of second-quarter revenue growth had been trimmed from a projected 4.9 per cent at the beginning of the year to 4.7 per cent at the beginning of April. However, as the reporting period has progressed, analysts have revised their estimates further downward to an average 0.9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.Less than half of companies to have reported second-quarter numbers performed better than expected. The number of companies beating revenue estimates has dropped below 50 per cent in only four other quarters: the first quarter of 2001, the fourth quarter of 2008, and the first two quarters of 2009.The situation in Europe, which by some estimates accounts for about 15 per cent of all revenues for S&P 500 companies, has not bypassed even Apple. The iPhone-maker’s revenues of $35bn missed analysts’ consensus estimate by $2.15bn, mostly because of poor European sales. The challenges of a global slowdown were compounded by the strong dollar, which has appreciated by 10 per cent against the euro in five months and is within a whisker of a two-year high.The 8 per cent rise in the dollar trade-weighted index is broadly consistent with US exports falling at an annual rate of about 5 per cent, according to Capital Economics.That has hit US companies with large international businesses. Dow Chemical cited a $400m currency effect in their 10 per cent European sales decline. McDonald’s, the largest restaurant chain by sales, also blamed lower revenues on foreign currency translation, which cost the company 7 cents per share.Industrial bellwethers including United Technologies, UPS, Ford, Eaton and Du Pont cut their full-year earnings outlooks. Caterpillar and Honeywell also cut sales outlooks, warning of slow growth ahead, but raised their profit forecasts.The fact that many companies maintained profits while revenues have fallen suggests that they were able to cut costs and reduce inventories. But if the top line continues to fall, cutting costs will not be a panacea.“We want to see these companies coming with both top-line and bottom-line growth,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “You can keep growing through cost cutting and productivity growth for only so long.”Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues
114;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-07-19T09:57:41Z;Tech boost for Asian equity markets;;Asian stocks made strong progress on Thursday, boosted by overnight gains on Wall Street thanks to robust earnings from technology groups.The FTSE Asia Pacific index climbed 1.5 per cent to 227.17 in late trade, with technology groups providing much of the weight behind the rally after better than expected results from US groups Intel, the memory chipmaker, and Honeywell, the electronics instruments maker.Chipmakers were among the top gainers on the pan-Asia index, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing climbing 3.6 per cent to T$77.50, while Samsung Electronics added 3.6 per cent to Won1,195,000.It was Australia’s S&P/ASX index, however, that made the biggest advance, climbing 2 per cent to 4,206.7 as energy stocks were boosted by gains for crude oil prices, while bid speculation lifted uranium miners and explorers.Paladin Energy was the biggest riser on the index after analysts noted that the uranium producer’s share price had fallen so low that the company was priced lower than the value of its net assets.The shares, which fell sharply following the Japan earthquake and subsequent nuclear crisis last year, climbed 9.4 per cent to A$1.17 on Thursday on talk of bid interest from a number of parties.Woodside Petroleum led the oil companies higher, climbing 7.5 per cent to A$32.67, while Beach Energy added 7.3 per cent to A$1.03, and Santos rose 5.8 per cent to A$10.69.Tech stocks helped drive Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index 0.8 per cent higher to 8,795.55.Advantest, the maker of chip testing equipment, climbed 6.5 per cent to Y1,125, while Dainippon Screen Manufacturing added 6.6 per cent to Y520.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index climbed 1.7 per cent to 19,559.05, while in mainland China the Shanghai Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,184.8.Motor stocks rallied in Seoul, helping the Kospi Composite climb 1.6 per cent to 1,822.96.Hyundai Motor rose 3 per cent to Won224,00 after data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association showed its market share rose to 6.3 per cent in the region, the largest ever for a Korean manufacturer.Kia Motors rose 3.2 per cent to Won75,200, while car parts maker Hyundai Mobis jumped 4.6 per cent to Won287,500.
115;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-07-18T20:18:00Z;Honeywell warns over US spending impasse;US activity offsets European weakness;Honeywell warned of a “tough” global economic outlook this year and that the US “fiscal cliff” could spark a slowdown in 2013, even as the US manufacturer’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and its stock surged.“The macroeconomic landscape is uncertain and that’s at best,” said Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive. “Everything out there suggests that conservative planning is best.”Mr Cote has been vocal about the risks to the US economy from the political impasse over tax rises and spending cuts. On Wednesday he warned that uncertainty is leaving many US companies reluctant to hire or make investments, although he did not talk specifically about Honeywell’s plans.“There is a greater chance of an overall slowdown if we don’t see some thoughtful moves and discussion,” he said.Mr Cote’s comments came as Honeywell reported net income rose 11.7 per cent in the second quarter, with strong sales growth in its aerospace and chemicals units offsetting weakness in Europe.Second-quarter net income of $905m, or $1.14 a share, compared with $810m, or $1.02 a share, a year ago and exceeded analysts’ average estimate of $1.11 a share.The company’s stock rose 6.6 per cent to $58.16 on Wednesday in New York.The maker of aircraft systems and other industrial components raised the low end of its full-year earnings guidance by 5 cents to a range of $4.40 to $4.55 a share, an increase of 9 per cent to 12 per cent from 2011. However, full-year sales growth was revised lower as Honeywell said it anticipated a “continued tough environment” around the globe.“We have focused on margin expansion as key to earnings growth to leverage sales,” Mr Cote said. Honeywell’s margins expanded by 150 basis points to 15.8 per cent in the quarter from a year ago.The company is in the middle of a restructuring process that is expected to cut $150m in costs this year and another $125m in 2013.“We will continue to be cautious about adding people back globally,” he said.Net sales were 3.8 per cent higher at $9.44bn in the second quarter, but missed Wall Street forecasts of $9.56bn.In Europe, Honeywell’s transport systems business was hit by “significantly lower” car production. The continent’s car market has been sagging due to excess capacity and the ongoing debt crisis.“We never expected much from Europe,” Mr Cote said.But he was sanguine about China, where recent slowing growth has raised worries among analysts, saying “you should bet on them, not against them”.In the US, strong demand for many products helped lift Honeywell’s overall results. “We clearly benefited in nearly across-the-board strength in our US business in the first half, continuing a trend that we saw in 2011,” said Dave Anderson, chief financial officer.However, he said Honeywell was making preparations for the prospect of deep cuts, particularly in defence spending, that might come at the end of the year if lawmakers did not reach an agreement on the pending expiration of the Bush tax cuts.“We would anticipate that large budget cuts are in the offing,” Mr Anderson said. But he added that “prudent and conservative” planning at Honeywell and other US businesses meant contingency plans were in the works. “We all lived through the recession. The playbook is one that we continue to draw upon.”Lower defence spending this year has already affected Honeywell’s aerospace business but rising commercial demand from Boeing and Airbus outweighed the drop in military demand in the second quarter, sending profits in the segment up 25 per cent.
116;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-07-12T19:48:07Z;Honeywell chief warns on debt gridlock;;A prominent US chief executive has urged business leaders to press politicians to agree on a solution to the country’s debt problems as concern rises that gridlock in Washington is damaging the economy.Writing in Friday’s Financial Times, David Cote, Honeywell chief executive, warns that the lack of political will to tackle the issue is creating uncertainty for companies facing investment and hiring decisions, and could lead to years of low growth or even another financial crisis.Tax cuts introduced under George W. Bush, former president, will expire at the end of the year as automatic spending cuts kick in. Disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over how to avoid this “fiscal cliff” has raised fears that the stand-off is holding back the US recovery.“CEOs can no longer stand on the sidelines,” Mr Cote writes. “We need to ensure debt resolution is a core part of the presidential election campaign.”President Barack Obama has proposed extending the Bush tax cuts only for Americans earning less than $250,000 a year. Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, has said the president’s proposal would hurt the already weakened economy.Over the next two days Mr Obama will take his message to Virginia, where he has scheduled a series of campaign stops.Business groups including the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have been active in the debate on the public finances and have called for solutions to avoid the fiscal cliff. In general, they have argued against tax increases and are in favour of lower government spending, often aligning themselves with Republican positions. Individual chief executives have typically not expressed their views publicly.The lack of political will to address our debt problem creates significant uncertainty for companies making investment and hiring decisionsLong-term interest rates have fallen as the national debt has grown, suggesting public borrowing is not putting any immediate pressure on the US economy. But Mr Cote argues that Congress and the administration should not “wait until the bond market forces us to do it”.Mr Cote was a member of the bipartisan US debt commission led by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, which in 2010 delivered recommendations that won some support. In a CNBC television interview on Thursday Mr Bowles said: “If I had to tell you the probability, I’d say the chances are we are going over the fiscal cliff.”
117;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;US set for earnings roadblock as growth falters;;US manufacturers are set to report their slowest growth in earnings since 2009, hit by the European crisis and a slowdown in emerging economies. Analysts are forecasting that industrial companies will fall well short of last year’s growth rates reported in the first quarter of 2012 despite being the fastest-growing sector in the US for second-quarter earnings, according to S&P Capital IQ.Manufacturing has been one of the brighter areas of the US economy, but last week the US Institute for Supply Management survey showed its weakest reading for the industry since July 2009.Scott Davis, an analyst at Barclays Capital, said: “We’ve hit a roadblock. Something happened in May that caused a real slowdown in spending.”US businesses were prepared for weak demand in Europe, but there have been recent signs that the region has been worse than expected, with confidence falling even in Germany, its strongest economy.Meanwhile, emerging economies that have seen slower growth, including China, India and Brazil, have failed to pick up as some analysts had hoped.The coming US reporting season, which begins on Monday with earnings from aluminium producer Alcoa after the market closes, will be closely watched for signs that companies are being forced to scale back the projections for growth they set out earlier in the year.Many manufacturing executives say they have become more cautious about the outlook. Dave Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, which makes aircraft systems and other components, told the Financial Times: “We are being much more careful on hiring and investment around the world, because this is not a time to be out in front with your commitments. We are well-prepared for another global recession, if we get one.”Boeing, the US’s biggest exporter, warned last week that it expected sluggish growth in the global economy for at least the next 18 months.“We’re looking at a world economy where … we slog through the situation here in Europe and then once you get into the 2014 timeframe and beyond, you see more normal economic growth,” said Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s vice-president of marketing. “What we are experiencing now will be normal for the next one to two years.”The outlook varies between sectors, with aerospace and the booming US car market among the more robust segments.One of the weaker areas is mining equipment, due to the industry’s heavy reliance on Chinese demand. Sales growth at Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment, has slowed sharply in recent months. Global demand for the manufacturer’s products grew 11 per cent in May from last year, but year-on-year sales growth has slowed every month this year.
118;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-06-01T19:57:27Z;Obama announces jobs help for war veterans;;President Barack Obama has launched two initiatives to help US veterans find jobs in the civilian economy, a growing challenge as thousands of service members return from the war in Afghanistan, joining the Iraq veterans still job-hunting.The initiatives are an effort to bring down the unemployment rate among veterans who served after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, which is about 9 per cent, almost a point higher than the national average.Veterans say they are often passed over for jobs they are well qualified for because civilian employers do not understand their experience.“I believe that no one who fights for this country should ever have to fight for a job when they come home,” Mr Obama said on Friday during a visit to a Honeywell factory in Minnesota that employs 65 veterans with manufacturing skills learnt during their military training or service. Honeywell, a diversified technology and manufacturing business, says that it has hired 900 veterans since 2011.“Unfortunately, a lot of heroes with advanced skills are not hired because they don’t have certificates,” the president said.His new five-year, $1bn plan to create a “Veterans Job Corps” would aim to help those who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan find work as police officers and firefighters, as well as other roles that use their military skills.Mr Obama has added the creation of the corps to the “to-do list” he has sent to Congress, part of an effort to spur action in gridlocked Washington. But with the political environment growing only more partisan as the November elections approach, the prospects for legislation being passed are slim.The White House also announced plans to help veterans with manufacturing skills receive civilian credentials and licences, an initiative it says will help up to 126,000 service members and which does not require congressional approval.The Pentagon task force has reached an agreement with several industry licensing agencies to help service members with experience in the engineering, logistics, machining sectors and the welding field to receive “industry-recognised, nationally portable certifications”.The Obama administration hopes to add other sectors, including healthcare and information technology, next year.The cost of the plan will be “minimal, in the tens of thousands of dollars” and would come from existing budgets, administration officials said.Mr Obama has ended the war in Iraq and announced a plan to withdraw from Afghanistan, but he remains the less popular of the presidential candidates among service members.He scored only 34 per cent support among veterans, according to a Gallup daily tracking poll published this week, while his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, had 58 per cent.
119;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-04-29T18:41:42Z;Slowdown points to gloom for industrials;;US manufacturers may struggle to maintain earnings momentum in the current quarter as orders for industrial goods show increasing signs of slowing down.Industrial companies’ results for the first quarter have for the most part been robust so far this earnings season, with Boeing, Caterpillar and 3M all raising their outlooks for the full year and companies such as General Electric, Honeywell and DuPont comfortably beating analysts’ expectations.While the results have been hailed as proof of how manufacturing continues to lead the US out of recovery, recent data suggest manufacturers will struggle to match those earnings in the second quarter.US business investment shrank at an annualised rate of 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, down from growth of 5.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Commerce Department said on Friday.That followed a Commerce Department report that showed orders for US durable goods fell 4.2 per cent in March, the largest drop in three years, while the Federal Reserve said production at US factories dropped in March for the first time in four months. First-quarter corporate earnings masked this weakness by reflecting strong performance in the first two months of the year.“I don’t think anyone doubts the strength of the economy at the turn of the year when earnings were generated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. “What the forward-looking surveys are showing is that we definitely should not extrapolate firmer activity. The drop-off in orders in durable goods [at the same time as] rising shipments [in the first quarter] would seem to corroborate that observation.”Reports by several regional Federal Reserve banks – including New York, Kansas City and Philadelphia – warn of a slowdown in April.One cause for concern is the continuing slowdown in China, cited by many big industrial companies as a drag on growth for the rest of the year.Caterpillar said last week that an unexpected slowdown in Chinese demand for construction equipment would force it to export 2,300 excavators to other developing countries this year for the first time since 2005.“Quarterly annualised first-quarter growth for manufacturing output was a very strong 10.4 per cent,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. “So Q2 may be disappointing.”As well as being flattered by low expectations, first-quarter earnings reflected an unusually mild winter. The unseasonably warm winter weather “may have accelerated some shipments”, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. “We are getting some payback for that now, which is slowing the economy today.”Companies may be cushioned by historically big backlogs in orders, said David Hale, a Chicago-based economist.US manufacturers reporting earnings this week include General Motors, Emerson Electric and Cummins.
120;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-04-20T18:50:35Z;Honeywell and GE set positive tone;;Global demand for industrial goods remains healthy in spite of concerns about economic slowdown and the eurozone crisis, two of America’s leading industrial groups have said.General Electric, the manufacturer of aero engines, power generation equipment and medical technology, and Honeywell, which makes aircraft systems and other components, both exceeded analysts’ expectations for first-quarter earnings and expressed confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year.Aerospace and the oil and gas industry were among the sectors where demand was particularly healthy, the companies said.Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said: “Europe is still unstable and we could be hit by geo-politics or other macro events. But right now, things look pretty good.”GE reported record order bookings in the first quarter, up 14 per cent excluding the effect of acquisitions, and reiterated its view that it was on course for robust earnings growth this year.Some of the large orders came from emerging economies including South Africa and Kenya, and resource-rich countries including Australia.Revenues from China and sub-Saharan Africa were both up 18 per cent, from Latin America up 35 per cent and from Canada up 40 per cent, while revenues from Russia doubled.GE spent $11.2bn on acquisitions last year, much of that to strengthen its presence serving the oil and gas industry.Profit margins in GE’s industrial business fell 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter compared to the equivalent period a year ago but the company said it expected them to rise for 2012 as a whole. Mr Sherin said the company’s priority in terms of capital allocation was to keep increasing the dividend in line with earnings.The dividend in the first quarter was 17 cents, up from a low of 10 cents per quarter in 2009-10, but still only 55 per cent of its level before it was cut in 2009 in response to the financial crisis.GE will have more cash available if, as planned, the finance arm GE Capital is allowed by the US Federal Reserve to resume paying a dividend to its parent this year.Honeywell reported a 21 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations and raised its guidance for the full year slightly, to predict an increase of 9-14 per cent.Dave Anderson, Honeywell’s chief financial officer, said the results showed the company could continue to grow strongly in spite of the weakness of demand in Europe. “You always have to sleep with one eye open, but we feel this is prudent guidance,” he said.Some markets were weak in China, he added, including components for commercial vehicles and controls such as thermostats. However, demand for aerospace and speciality materials was generally very strong.GE shares rose 1.9 per cent to $19.51 by early afternoon, while Honeywell rose 3.3 per cent to $59.93.
121;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-03-27T16:22:58Z;United Tech faces probe over Goodrich bid;Europe’s top competition regulator concerned over ‘very high’ market share of combined group;United Technologies is to face an in-depth European Commission investigation into its $16.5bn bid to purchase Goodrich, a maker of aircraft components, suggesting that the US industrial conglomerate may need to consider concessions to win approval for the takeover.Launching a lengthy probe that could last until August, Europe’s top competition regulator cited specific concerns about the “very high” market share of the combined group in areas such as engine controls and power generators.Stressing the need to prevent a rise in prices for aircraft and engine makers, Joaquín Almunia, the European Union’s competition commissioner, said: “The aviation equipment industry is already concentrated and is characterised by high barriers to entry. We need to make sure that competition is preserved and incentives to innovate remain.”The proposed deal is the biggest deal in the aviation sector in recent years and significantly UTC’s position in the aerospace industry. While UTC said it always expected close scrutiny of the deal from Brussels, the investigation into a big deal between two US groups will raise some potentially sensitive political issues.The Commission rarely uses its power to block mergers but one of its most famous interventions came in the US aerospace sector, when in 2001 it vetoed General Electric’s proposed $45bn takeover of Honeywell, even though US regulators cleared the deal.In its announcement on Tuesday, the Commission stressed that its decision to investigate the deal would not prejudge the outcome. Under a so-called “second phase” investigation, the Commission has about 90 working days to decide whether to block, approve the deal or clear the deal with conditions.On AC power generation, the competition officials raised worries over the high barriers to entry in a market where Goodrich appears “the strongest contender to UTC’s dominant position and as a potential partner for prospective entrants”.With regard to engine controls, the Commission found that the deal would “create a concentrated market structure at a worldwide level”, leaving the combined group with a “very high market share”.A second set of issues relates to the concerns of Goodrich customers that compete with UTC’s Pratt & Whitney subsidiary.“The removal of Goodrich as an independent supplier of engine controls and fuel nozzles, particularly for small engines, could result in higher input prices for engine manufacturers competing with Pratt & Whitney,” the Commission said. “In particular, switching supplier could take a long time and be costly for those currently sourcing from Goodrich.”Goodrich, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, makes landing gear and other components, while UTC makes helicopters, aircraft engines and building products such as lifts and air conditioning units. A UTC spokesperson said the in-depth investigation “is not surprising”.“It is part of the normal regulatory review process,” he added, saying the company expected the transaction to be cleared by the middle of the year.
122;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-02-13T15:36:39Z;China’s upstart aims to put rivals in a spin;Comac has hopes of challenging Airbus and Boeing, but the aircraft manufacturer may discover that state funding is as much of a burden as a benefit, reports Simon Rabinovitch;An upstart Chinese rival is about to make life for Airbus and Boeing a lot more difficult, at least according to Michael O’Leary, chief executive of Ryanair.In assisting the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, or Comac, on the development of a new commercial jet, Mr O’Leary has seen first-hand the vast investment that Beijing is making to break into the ranks of the world’s elite aircraft manufacturers.“The Chinese will take a huge amount of orders away from Airbus and Boeing overnight, which will create significant turmoil in the marketplace,” he predicted last year.Others in the industry are far more sceptical. They say that Comac’s biggest advantage – its strong state backing – may also be its biggest obstacle.Comac’s first foray into manufacturing has certainly met stiff headwinds. The ARJ21, a regional jet meant to compete with those from Embraer and Bombardier, completed its maiden flight in 2008, three years behind schedule. There have also been repeated delays in its airworthiness certification.When it does eventually enter commercial service, perhaps this year, it is likely to be about as technically advanced, but not as efficient, as Embraers that are a decade older, says Bradley Perrett, a Chinese aerospace expert with Aviation Week in Beijing.While that would be a disastrous debut for a privately owned company, state-owned Comac has been able to chalk it up to experience.Its second aircraft programme, the narrow-body C919, appears to going more smoothly, though it is still at an early stage of development. This is the aircraft that has so caught Ryanair’s attention, offering a potential alternative to the top-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.The C919 was a well-selected project, aiming at a gap that had opened in the market because Boeing and Airbus had done little to modernise their models. Comac has turned to foreign companies such as General Electric and Honeywell for components that should make its aircraft more technologically advanced.“The problem is they have got to pull it all together and make it work.” Mr Perrett says. “It is not likely that Comac can integrate this technology and create highly competitive aircraft that can be sold without heavy production subsidies, at least at first.”Comac says it has already received 215 orders for the C919, mainly from state-owned airlines and leasing companies. The final product may be more marketable than the ARJ21, but the C919 programme is also expected to be a money loser, another learning experience for Comac.Despite these difficulties, the government’s resolve to build a global aerospace champion is showing no sign of waning. Last year Beijing made aircraft manufacturing a cornerstone of its “new strategic industry” plan, locking in long-term financial support for Comac.Furthermore, in an indication that national leaders are satisfied with the company’s progress, its former chairman Zhang Qingwei was promoted to an important political post as governor of Hebei province last year.The prize for Comac is less the global market than it is China itself. Boeing estimates that China will add 5,000 commercial aircraft worth $600bn by 2030, making it far and away the biggest purchaser of aircraft over the coming decade.Comac has targeted a one-third share of the domestic market, which is currently split roughly evenly between Airbus and Boeing.“The way this market works, [Comac] will eat into everyone’s share,” says Ihssane Mounir, a senior vice-president with Boeing. “But we are not worried about competition. Competition is the mother of all improvements.”If Comac can successfully produce efficient aircraft, it will ignite a big debate about the appropriate relationship between government and aircraft manufacturers – Airbus and Boeing have been at the centre of a long-running World Trade Organisation case over subsidies.However, some observers believe that state control will ultimately also check Comac’s progress. “We’ve seen this before,” says Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy. “This was the Soviet Union’s approach. It produces an incredibly expensive duplication of an aircraft industry supply chain, all of which is always playing catch-up.”Comac is mainly drawing on components made by foreign companies with joint ventures in China, as the government has mandated. Yet these companies are not offering their latest or best technology to China because of insufficient protection of intellectual property.Mr Aboulafia says production process effectively guarantees mediocrity and that the only solution was to give engineers freedom to choose whatever components they want, insulated from political interference.“China could one day be a world aviation powerhouse, but they will have to head in a totally different direction. State-owned enterprises do have a place in this world. Commercial jetliner production is most definitely not one of them,” he says.
123;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-01-29T21:45:48Z;Western industrials feel a Chinese burn;;Western industrial companies have seen a slowdown in some markets in China as efforts to cool the world’s second largest economy have hit demand for capital goods and products linked to the construction industry.China was until recently a source of rapid growth for US and European manufacturers, helping to offset weak sales in developed countries.Last week, however, leading bellwether industrial groups including Siemens, 3M and Eaton were among those expressing caution on Chinese sales, joining others such as Volvo and ABB that warned of cooling demand at the end of last year.Joe Kaeser, chief financial officer at Siemens, which reported a 16 per cent decline in new Chinese orders in its fiscal first quarter, said the company had witnessed a “marked slowdown in short cycle businesses” in China, particularly in industrial automation.George Buckley, chief executive at 3M, the US industrial group said: “Our China team anticipate continued below-trend growth in the first half of 2012.”Weakness in Chinese orders comes at an unwelcome time for industrial companies, which are already having to deal with a European economy on the brink of recession. “Coming on the back of the weak European picture, the situation in China is not going to be a help to first-quarter earnings,” said Ben Uglow at Morgan Stanley.Not all western companies selling in China have suffered from a slowdown in demand. Honeywell, which makes aircraft parts and controls, said on Friday its sales in China were up 18 per cent in 2011.Dave Anderson, the company’s chief financial officer, said sales growth for products linked to the residential and commercial property markets, such as heating and air-conditioning equipment, had slowed, but other markets such as aircraft and truck components were “doing very well”.Consumer-orientated businesss are also still enjoying a boost from robust retail demand, as booming Chinese sales of Apple’s iPhone attest.China’s property slowdown has been a result of government policy intended to rein in house prices and curb inflation.Other companies affected have been those selling short-cycle products: items that are ordered, paid for and delivered in a relatively short time, such as industrial automation equipment.Overcapacity in China’s steel, wind or shipbuilding industries as well as slowing infrastructure spending are also eroding industrial volumes and margins.Many western companies are looking ahead to a return to more rapid growth in Chinese markets this year.DuPont, the chemicals group, said last week that sales volumes in the Asia-Pacific region were down 23 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the same period a year earlier. However, Ellen Kullman, DuPont’s chief executive, said a reduction from 9 per cent to 8 per cent growth in China was “still pretty good if you look around the world”.After heavy destocking in the fourth quarter, “we’re starting with very little inventory …And I think that bodes well for an improving picture”, she added.Signs in the US of a continued recovery in demand for capital goods also suggest many companies may be able to offset sluggish markets in China.Most economists expect China to pick up in the second half of the year as the government eases its tightening measures to support the economy. Bernd Laux, at Cheuvreux, said: “It’s not currently a huge headache for corporate management. But should the US recovery come to a halt and the Chinese market not recover during the second half, then it may become a more significant problem.”Additional reporting by Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing and Michael Stothard in Stockholm
124;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2012-01-29T16:30:30Z;Chinese shopping spree slows;US and European companies report reduced orders;Buoyant Chinese demand has been a wonderful palliative for western industrial companies in recent years, helping to offset anaemic European and US sales.However, comments from leading industrial companies last week suggest Chinese demand for a host of western-produced capital goods ranging from earthmoving equipment to automation technology is – at least temporarily – starting to slow.China’s efforts to rein in the real estate market and engineer a soft landing come as its manufacturers hold back fixed-asset investments because of tighter credit, overcapacity and slower demand from the debt-encumbered eurozone.Volvo, the commercial vehicles group, warned as early as last summer of an impending slowdown in Chinese demand for construction equipment, which it described as temporary.In October ABB, the Swiss electrical engineering group, also observed weaker demand for its power systems and process automation technology in China, where orders declined by 5 per cent in the third quarter.As European and US industrials have begun reporting their latest quarterly figures, more companies have expressed caution on the short-term outlook in China.Siemens, the German industrial bellwether that makes everything from trains to gas turbines and medical diagnostic equipment, warned last week that Chinese orders had declined by 16 per cent to €1.4bn in its fiscal first quarter, owing primarily to weakness in industrial automation – a technology that is typically one of the first to register a slowdown because of short lead times.Joe Kaeser, chief financial officer, said: “The whole world was worried to death about a hard landing [in China] …We have reason to hope this is a soft landing in progress, and after that there will be a journey to new heights.” The company, he added, expected a return to growth in China in the fourth quarter.Sandvik, the Swedish tool and mining equipment maker that cut 500 jobs this month, said “financing uncertainty” in China had “reduced the willingness of companies and private individuals to invest”.In the US, Caterpillar, the manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, said it had also seen a drop in sales of new machines in China last year, although it had gained market share.Different companies have experienced the slowdown at different points. United Technologies, the manufacturer of Otis elevators, was hit only in the fourth quarter of 2011, when order growth slowed to 7 per cent from a 20 per cent average for the year. Greg Hayes, United Technologies’ chief financial officer, said this was “directly due to the actions of the government to try to slow down housing”.Other western companies have not yet suffered at all. Growth in Chinese car sales slowed last year after the government withdrew tax incentives for small-engine vehicles. But premium carmakers such as BMW and Volkswagen’s Audi were among foreign companies that continued to enjoy record sales, boosting suppliers.Honeywell, the US industrial group, highlighted sales of truck components such as turbochargers as a particular area of strength. Controls for mining and other process industries had also had strong growth in orders, it said.Meanwhile, retail sales have remained robust. Apple said Chinese demand was “staggering” and “off the charts”.The Chinese economy grew at an annual rate of 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, the weakest in 2½ years but still a handsome pace by western standards, and economists still expect gross domestic product to expand by about 8 per cent this year.Analysts believe western industrials should have few troubles withstanding a couple of quarters of slower growth, and with an average of about 10 per cent of Chinese sales exposure remains limited. Investment is likely to pick up this year if China, as expected, eases monetary policy further to support the economy.However, some economists believe the dynamics of the Chinese economy might change, meaning foreign industrials that profit from the country’s growth will have to change, too. China’s property boom, for example, may become a thing of the past.“China has no choice but to switch from an investment-driven to a consumption-driven economy. Infrastructure, construction and mining-related industries should see their growth rates wane accordingly,” analysts at Société Générale told clients.Wage inflation will instead encourage greater industrial automation in China, while China’s growing ranks of elderly will require spending on medical equipment, its report noted.In addition, US and European companies will also face increasing competition on their own turf.Bernd Laux at Cheuvreux said. “The more the Chinese economy slows, the more Chinese vendors will try to sell their wares abroad.”Additional reporting by Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing, Jeremy Lemer in New York and Michael Stothard in Stockholm
125;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Pension costs cast shadow over Honeywell profits;Cross-sector growth reaffirms 2012 predictions;Honeywell, the aerospace and controls group, reported a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits excluding non-operating pension costs to $1.15bn for the fourth quarter of last year, thanks to strong growth across its businesses, and reaffirmed its prediction of continued robust growth in 2012.However, reported profits were hit by a $1.8bn charge for pension expenses, caused by the fall in interest rates and investment returns that fell below the company’s long-term expectation, giving a headline loss of $657m before tax.Several other US companies have been reporting increased pension expenses because of those factors, but Honeywell faces a particularly large effect. It has chosen to use a mark-to-market accounting methodology that requires shifts in the value of assets and liabilities each year to be reflected in its reported earnings, rather than spreading the effect over a longer period, and also has a legacy of former staff on defined benefit plans.Excluding those costs, which do not reflect a cash payment, earnings per share were up 21 per cent at $1.05.The underlying results were in line with analysts’ expectations, and the shares were little changed, rising 0.8 per cent to $58.34 by New York afternoon trading.Revenues for the fourth quarter were up 8 per cent at $9.47bn, and operating profits before interest and tax were up 15 per cent at $1.43bn, reflecting a continued increase in margins.Analysts have warned that corporate margins will come under pressure this year, but Dave Anderson, Honeywell’s chief financial officer, said he expected that improvement could continue.“We just have to continue to make sure that price and productivity offset inflation,” he said.“There is a lot of work in this company that continues every day in driving productivity forward.”The company was sticking with its guidance, as set out in December, that earnings per share, excluding non-operating pension costs, would rise by 12-19 per cent this year.Mr Anderson said he thought the European economy was now in recession, but the effect on Honeywell’s businesses varied. Heating and air-conditioning equipment was hit by the property market downturn, he said, but aircraft parts for the after-market remained strong.The US, he added was “a bright spot …steady at a good level” with sales rising at an annual rate of 7 per cent in the fourth quarter.While echoing comments from other US companies that sales linked to the Chinese property and construction market had slowed, he said other sectors such as aerospace and truck parts were very strong, and sales for China overall were up 18 per cent in 2011.
126;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;US industrials saddle up for bumpy 2012;;Confronted by an unsettled global outlook for 2012, leading US industrial companies are turning inward to boost performance, cutting costs and restructuring their businesses in an attempt to raise earnings on what could be a bumpy journey.In the past month or so, a dozen leading US industrial groups have provided guardedly optimistic forecasts for next year, arguing that a mix of exposure to faster growing markets, acquisitions and productivity improvements will help them to power through any slowdown.Manufacturing companies will need to work hard to stay ahead of a volatile global economy. Weak spots include Europe, which may already be in recession, and potentially China, where the government is faced with a real estate bubble.In a sign of what to expect, Alcoa, which on Monday opens the US reporting season, last week unveiled aggressive moves to cut costs affecting 12 per cent of its aluminium smelting capacity.On average, US industrial companies are expecting lower revenue growth in 2012 than last year but higher earnings growth through increased volumes.For the fourth quarter of last year, analysts on average expect the industrial sector to report earnings 7.2 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 2010, roughly in line with growth for the market as a whole, according to S&P Capital IQ. Analysts expect that pace to accelerate this year, but the economic outlook suggests that pickup is far from certain.Even in the US, where recent data have pointed to unexpected economic strength, there are reasons for caution. Richard Fearon, chief financial officer of Eaton, the manufacturer of industrial equipment, noted recently that economists were unusually divided on the outlook.Given the political deadlock in Washington, “it’s hard to figure out exactly where we end up”, he told investors late last year. “That is a note of caution that I think most large companies have about 2012. And I think we are all planning in a pretty conservative way.”Global uncertainty is already taking its toll. Last month, Emerson Electric, a widely respected conglomerate, convened a hasty conference call to warn that its revenues in the first quarter of 2012 would be down 3-5 per cent compared to the same period a year earlier, though maintaining its full year guidance.“It’s clearly extraordinary times out there, a lot of moving parts,” David Farr, chief executive of Emerson, told investors.Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners said the move was partly due to company-specific problems and the impact of the recent floods in Thailand but noted that it triggered alarm bells nonetheless.“What we fear most is that all the companies who have provided guidance in the last [few] weeks have to substantially backpedal due to much worse macro conditions than they anticipated,” he said, though adding that for the moment industrials were maintaining capital expenditures.Some industrial companies have already decided to cut costs further to prepare for this uncertain future. Emerson, Danaher and a number of others have said they will modestly increase spending on restructuring in 2012 while others such as Honeywell expect to benefit from action in late 2011.Alcoa is planning to shut down temporarily 5 per cent of its smelting capacity, and close permanently a further 7 per cent that had been in temporary shutdown. Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive, described the moves as “difficult but necessary steps to improve Alcoa’s competitiveness, preserve and grow shareholder value and protect jobs.”Lawrence Culp, chief executive of Danaher, the acquisitive conglomerate, says the company is already running a modified version of its 2008 playbook, targeting market share, cutting costs and using cash to make deals. “We’re just trying to be nimble …not be draconian and preparing for the apocalypse,” he told investors in December.Some analysts worry about a lack of urgency. In a note to investors in mid-December, Barclays Capital said many industrial groups seemed to have run out of ideas and warned that investors were losing faith.However, if it looks as though margins – already at record highs in the industrial sector – are coming under pressure, companies say they will take more radical action. “We’ll try to read and react to what happens [in] the next couple of weeks,” says Mr Culp, “[to see] if we need to take a more conservative posture”.Another tactic for securing earnings growth in turbulent markets will be through acquisitions. Danaher expects to have about $5bn available to make deals in the next two years, and Morgan Stanley estimates that conglomerates will have about $90bn for deals and share repurchases through 2014.“Industrial companies will remain active in looking at larger deals, but are focused on transactions that generate significant synergies, rather than on further diversification,” said Larry Hamdan, head of global industrials M&A at Barclays Capital.This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.
127;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-12-16T20:33:04Z;EU antitrust body investigates Honeywell and DuPont;;European Union antitrust authorities are investigating whether Honeywell and DuPont acted together to restrict competition when launching a new lower-emission refrigerant required for cars air-conditioning systems in Europe.The European Commission said on Friday that, in response to complaints, it had opened antitrust proceedings to investigate whether “joint development, licencing and production arrangements entered into between the two companies in relation to these refrigerants restrict competition on the markets”.Under an EU directive that took effect in January, carmakers began using in their new models 1234yf, a refrigerant developed by the two US companies to replace an old one, R134a, which does not meet Brussels’ guidelines on limiting global warming. The coolant was selected under the auspices of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which represents the automotive sector.The EU said it was examining whether Honeywell engaged in deceptive conduct during the evaluation of 1234yf in 2007 and 2009. The complainants allege that Honeywell did not disclose its patents and patent applications while the new refrigerant was being assessed, and so failed to grant licences on “fair and reasonable” terms.Honeywell said it was committed to co-operating with Brussels in the probe.“Honeywell is confident that our practices are consistent with the law and that the Commission will conclude that we acted in full compliance with European Union competition rules,” the company said.“As the Commission noted in its announcement, the opening of formal proceedings is a procedural step and does not in any way prejudge the existence of an infringement or the outcome of this investigation.”DuPont said that it “will co-operate fully with this inquiry and is confident that the Commission will conclude that actions taken by DuPont complied with applicable laws”.
128;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-12-13T18:07:44Z;Skills gap hobbles US employers;;Drew Greenblatt has been looking for more than a year for three sheet-metal set-up operators to work day, night or weekend shifts.The president of Marlin Steel Wire Products, a company in Baltimore with 30 employees, Mr Greenblatt says his inability to find qualified workers is hampering his business’s growth. “If I could fill those positions, I could raise our annual revenues from $5m to $7m,” he says.He is offering a salary of more than $80,000 with overtime, including health and pension benefits. Yet in spite of extensive advertising, he has had no qualified applicants. He is trying to train some of his unskilled staff but says none has the ability or drive to complete the training.Mr Greenblatt’s predicament speaks to one of the biggest economic debates about today’s 8.6 per cent US unemployment rate: is it merely a cyclical problem that will shrink as demand recovers? Or is it something deeper and more structural, a “mismatch” between the skills workers have and those companies need?The idea there is something structurally wrong with the US workforce is controversial among economists but has a certain resonance with the public. Since the emergence of Japan as a technology and manufacturing powerhouse in the 1970s, Americans have been anxiousthat they were losing their competitive edge to better-educated, harder-working rivals.Economists trying to figure out whether unemployment is cyclical or structural have turned to what they call the Beveridge curve: the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate.Vacancies, the number of unfilled positions, have risen by 35 per cent since their trough in June 2009 – but the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. If there are jobs but people are not filling them, it may be because their skills are not up to scratch, say those who fear structural unemployment.But a preponderance of economists argue this is a misreading of the data. A recent San Francisco Fed paper finds that vacancies are high relative to hiring across a broad range of industries, including those such as construction, where recent job cuts mean that there is most unlikely to be a skills shortage.The authors suggest companies may not be trying very hard to fill jobs, while workers in receipt of unemployment insurance may not be trying that hard to find them.Policy moves by the US Federal Reserve reflect a view that most unemployment is not the result of a skills mismatch. But even those who believe that today’s unemployment problem is primarily cyclical say closing the “skills gap” noted by Mr Greenblatt will be essential if Americans are to enjoy stable work and rising wages.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, told an audience in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August that the US had to “foster the development of a skilled workforce” if it was to enjoy good longer-term prospects. The US education system “despite considerable strengths, poorly serves a substantial portion of our population,” he said.US companies that are growing say an unqualified workforce is already a significant barrier to hiring.In a September poll of owners of fast-growing, privately held US companies undertaken by the non-profit Kauffman Foundation, the inability to find qualified workers was cited as the biggest obstacle to growth. Some 40 per cent of respondents said they were being held back by the skills gap, compared with just 13 per cent by lack of demand.Advanced Technology Services (ATS), a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron, is finding it tough to fill the 160 job openings it has available for roles such as maintenance and machine technicians.The company’s revenues grew by 35 per cent last year and are on course for 25 per cent growth this year. But Jeff Owens, chief executive, says it could expand faster if it could find qualified workers more quickly. “In other businesses the capacity constraint is buildings, plant or equipment,” he says. “In our business, a service business, it’s people.”US manufacturers have 600,000 unfilled positions because of a lack of qualified skilled workers, according to a report released in October by Deloitte, the consultants, and the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry body.Jill Bellak, chief operating officer of MBX, a company in suburban Chicago that makes computer hardware, says the fast-growing business is finding it tough to find good software engineers, production workers and salespeople to add to its 78-strong workforce.“You hear how high unemployment is and you think it would be easy to hire, but companies have tended to cut their lower performers and retain their best people,” says Ms Bellak. “Meanwhile, talented people are less inclined to leave their current positions than they would be in good times.”In manufacturing, the skills problem dates at least to the 1970s and 1980s, when companies began automating factories and outsourcing production. As a result, manufacturers found they did not have jobs for the people leaving their in-house training programmes, some of which were then scrapped.Some big manufacturers still train in-house, including Boeing, the aerospace manufacturer, which spends $80m a year on training its existing workforce. But not all do. “Technology moves fast and most companies don’t have the money or resources to pay for extensive retraining,” said Sir James Dyson, the British household appliances engineer.Without in-house training programmes, companies have often been left looking for staff with specific skills. “A generation ago, employers would hire and train employees. Now, they demand trained workers,” says Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school.“The skills gap is largely a figment of companies’ imagination,” says Mr Cappelli. “They cannot find workers to do the very specific tasks they want done. That is different from not being able to find capable workers.”Companies counter that today’s jobs require a broad set of skills, and that the US educational system is not producing workers with the flexibility they need.“We have a training programme, but if someone applies for a job and doesn’t have basic math, I don’t have the wherewithal to teach them basic math,” says Charles Cannon, chief executive of JBT, a maker of food-processing machinery and airport equipment.American 15-year-olds ranked 25th among the 34 developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in maths, 17th in science and 14th in reading ability, according to a 2009 OECD study.Many companies are realising they need to take the initiative in collaborating with educational institutions. Martin Swarbrick, chief executive of Bison Gear & Engineering, a Chicago manufacturer with 250 staff that makes industrial motors, says his company has had such a programme in place for years and it has helped him offset the skills gap.“We’ve done a lot of promoting from within,” he says. “A lot of our people started on the shop floor and now they’re completing their Masters degrees.”
129;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-12-09T20:09:09Z;Bullish General Electric raises its dividend;;"General Electric, the largest US industrial group, has raised its dividend for the fourth time in two years, continuing the gradual reversal of the steep cut it made in 2009 during the financial crisis.The quarterly dividend is being raised from 15 cents to 17 cents per share, a 13 per cent increase, in line with analysts’ expectations.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company’s “financial performance continues to accelerate,” adding: “We believe that the GE business model will continue to deliver strong earnings and cash flow growth going forward.”The dividend is now a little over half its peak level of 31 cents per share before the 2009 cut.GE’s shares have lagged behind the S&P 500 index over the past six months, but were given a modest boost by the dividend announcement and closed up 3.3 per cent at $16.84, outperforming a rising market.At that share price, a sustained 17 cent quarterly dividend implies an annual yield of 4 per cent; higher than some of GE’s peers such as United Technologies, which has a historic yield of 2.5 per cent, or Honeywell at 2.8 per cent.One focus of investor concern has been the implications of the turmoil in Europe for GE Capital, the company’s finance arm, which in the third quarter provided 31 per cent of group profits.However, at a presentation for analysts this week, Jeff Bornstein, the division’s chief financial officer, said he expected earnings to be up by “double digits” next year, even if there is a recession in Europe, which GE expects.The cash flow from the non-financial businesses has been squeezed this year, partly because of a rise in working capital needed to meet rising sales and orders.Jeff Sprague, an analyst at Vertical Research, said the industrial side faced challenges next year, because of the costs of two new engine programmes, the GEnx and the LeapX, and pressure on prices of wind turbines and gas turbines for power generation.Nevertheless, Mr Immelt argues that the company is in a strong financial position. This year, it has been able to buy back $2bn worth of shares as of the end of September; pay $3.3bn to buy back preference shares from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway that were issued to help stabilise the group during the crisis; spend $11.2bn on acquisitions, mostly in energy; and raise the dividend.Net cash at the end of the third quarter, excluding GE Capital’s requirements, was $8.7bn.The cash position next year will also be strengthened by the planned resumption of dividend payments from GE Capital to its parent, which have been suspended since 2009.GE will give further details of its plans in its annual outlook presentation to analysts next Tuesday."
130;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T02:00:22+0000;Risk-on/risk-off markets;This is a terrible time for the stockpicker as the eurozone crisis drags on;"Gee, thanks Bill. The imminent departure of Bill Miller from a flagship equity fund at Legg Mason, the US mutual fund house, should be the opportunity of a lifetime for his successor as portfolio manager, Sam Peters. Yet, as Mr Peters noted in a recent pamphlet, this is a bad time for the stockpicker. While markets fret over the collapse of the eurozone, equities have become “an undifferentiated lump of risk assets”, he wrote, to be “bought during ‘risk on’ regimes and sold or shorted during ‘risk off’ episodes”.Correlation has indeed been climbing all year. Since January, stocks as diverse as Dow Chemical, Honeywell (engineering) and Loews (insurance) have done exactly what the S&P 500 index has done, nine days out of 10. The third quarter was particularly tough for managers trying to sort wheat from chaff: the average level of the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s implied correlation index for the S&P 500, which tracks how much stocks move in tandem, was a record high of 71.In that kind of environment, macro will always trump micro. Hedge funds running global macro strategies, flitting across liquid assets around the world, posted $81bn of gains during that period, according to Hedge Fund Research. (Equity hedge – the stockpickers’ paradise – lost $51bn.)Institutional investors seemed to doubt macro funds could continue to outperform: they suffered net outflows during the quarter. Since then, the implied correlation of
S&P stocks has climbed higher still, to 82 in November. The rise of index-linked products amplifies
the trend. The creation and redemption of exchange traded funds leads to the buying and selling of all constituents of the
indices tracked by the funds. Until markets discriminate once more, stockpickers will struggle. A monkey throwing darts at a board will seem just as effective – and a lot cheaper."
131;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Honeywell buys Singapore safety boot maker;;Honeywell International, the US industrial conglomerate, on Tuesday agreed to buy King’s Safetywear, a Singapore-based maker of steel toe-capped boots, for $338m as part of its efforts to bulk up its presence in the market for workplace safety equipment.The deal marks Honeywell’s third large acquisition in the sector in as many years. In 2008, it purchased Norcross Safety Products, which makes respirators and protective headgear, for about $1.2bn and it bought Sperian, a French rival, in 2010 for about $1.4bn.A number of US conglomerates have made similar moves in recent years, buying companies that make personal protection equipment for firefighters and industrial workers in order to take advantage of the fast growth rates and relatively high margins in the sector.Honeywell, which makes everything from components for air conditioning units to aircraft engines, generated about $2bn of its $33bn revenue last year from its life safety products business. In this segment, it competes against US industrial conglomerates such as 3M and Tyco and also specialists such as MSA and Kwintet of Sweden.KSW is headquartered in Singapore and employs about 1,500 mainly in south-east Asia, Australia and Europe, where its Otter, King’s and Oliver brands of heavy duty boots have substantial market positions.KSW is forecast to generate about $138m of sales in 2011. The price values the company, which is owned by Navis Capital Partners, a south-east Asian private equity firm, at about 11.5 times forecast 2011 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.“This seems like a logical extension of Honeywell’s … portfolio,” wrote Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse in a note to clients. “Cross-selling opportunities seem likely and it enhances Honeywell’s geographic footprint in higher-growth regions.”In mid-morning trading, Honeywell shares slipped about 4 per cent to $51.51 amid a broader market sell-off. Over the year to date, Honeywell shares have lost about 3 per cent of their value, roughly in line with the performance of the S&P 500 index.
132;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-10-30T12:45:53Z;Manufacturers ready to battle slowdown;;Most of the world’s big manufacturers are in better shape than three years ago to weather the looming economic storms and should steer through 2012 without serious damage to profits, according to industrial experts.Even so, an overdependence on China for creating demand growth has added to the risks for big manufacturers as they brace themselves for a difficult spell due to a slowing world economy.In the past two weeks, several large manufacturers such as the German chemicals group BASF and US industrial business Honeywell have warned of slowing orders, as company activity is hit by economic weakness in the US and Europe, as well as signs of a slowdown in China.More indications of nervousness may emerge this week, as large production companies including the Luxembourg-based steelmaker ArcelorMittal and French engineering group Alstom unveil quarterly results.However, companies’ cautious approach in the past two years over hiring new employees and expanding plants means many of them are “lean and battle-ready”, according to Kevin O’Marah, vice-president for supply chain research at the Gartner business consultancy.We’ll see a slowing in profits growth among manufacturing businesses, but it won’t be a disaster“In 2012 we’ll see a slowing in profits growth among manufacturing businesses, but it won’t be a disaster,” said Barry Misthal, head of global manufacturing at PwC, the consultancy.IHS Global Insight, an economics research group, has also expressed relative confidence. It says that global industrial output – mainly manufacturing but also covering energy – is likely to rise 4 per cent next year compared to 2011, as against a 2.7 per cent growth expected for total world gross domestic product.When the financial crisis hit in 2008, many big makers of goods from industrial materials to factory equipment experienced big cuts in orders, leading to markedly lower production during 2009 and serious shortfalls in profits, along with large employment reductions.As signs of economic fragility have become more evident in the past few weeks, only a few large manufacturers have so far announced a serious slowing in activity.An exception was French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroën, which last week said it would cut 6,000 jobs in Europe next year and reduced its earnings forecast. Other companies such as General Electric of the US and Switzerland’s ABB have been relatively upbeat.But Jay Swaminathan, a manufacturing and technology professor at the University of North Carolina, says a “flipside” to any general optimism is that too many companies have become dependent on emerging nations led by China – but also including India and Brazil – for demand expansion. Stephan Wagner, a manufacturing expert at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, said: “Around 2008, many industrial companies had two big growth markets: China and the US. Now, everything is focused on China.”PwC’s Mr Misthal said that if annual Chinese GDP growth fell from the levels of about 10 per cent in recent years to 6-7 per cent, this could cause “significant problems” for manufacturers.
133;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-10-21T21:58:46Z;Global demand boosts GE industrial revenues;;General Electric, the US conglomerate, reported a sharp increase in third-quarter industrial revenues and predicted continued momentum in 2012, but operating margins slipped, prompting concerns about the profitability of its core businesses.In the three months to the end of September, industrial revenues rose 19 per cent to about $23.4bn, thanks to recent acquisitions and strong international demand compared with 2010, while total revenues were flat at about $35.4bn.GE’s third-quarter results, reported on Friday, were complicated by a number of one-off events, but net income attributable to shareholders rose 18 per cent to $2.3bn, or about 22 cents per share, up 22 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier.GE said industrial operating profit margins fell from 16.5 per cent in 2010 to 13.7 per cent due to lower prices for its wind turbines and the initial costs of some acquisitions.“The third quarter for industrial was mostly what we’d call ‘profitless prosperity’,” Scott Davis of Barclays Capital wrote in a note to clients. “GE gained share … outgrew all of its key competitors but at what cost? Margins on new equipment … were very weak.”GE was optimistic about the outlook. Executives argued that its financial unit would continue to generate substantial profits in 2012, while its industrial businesses would benefit from recent acquisitions, new products and a $191bn order backlog.“Our two big businesses, aviation and energy, [have] extremely strong backlogs, tremendous product profiles, really good geographic mix … So, our belief is we ought to see very attractive organic growth and expanding margins industrially in 2012,” said Jeff Immelt, chief executive of GE.“We’re planning on a slow-growth developed world [and] continued high-growth developing world based on the businesses we’re in,” said Keith Sherin, GE chief financial officer. “We’re in heavy infrastructure and that’s where those capital expenditures are being made in those growth regions.”GE’s bullishness contrasts with more cautious statements by its industrial peers. On Friday, Honeywell, another US conglomerate, reported strong profits and revenues thanks to demand for its aerospace products but noted growing uncertainty over the economic outlook.In response, Honeywell, and other major industrial conglomerates including United Technologies and Danaher intend to focus on restructuring, trimming workers and consolidating factories in order to cut costs and boost margins.“It is the smart thing to do in an increasingly uncertain economic environment. In just the last three months we have seen continued downward revisions in global GDP forecasts. You can’t ignore that stuff. The economy matters,” said David Anderson, chief financial officer of Honeywell.By the close, GE shares were down 1.9 per cent to $16.31. Over the year to date GE shares have dropped about 10 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent loss for the S&P 500 index.

Trading was upbeat but twitchy ahead of the European summit this weekend to discuss a support plan for the region.Better than expected US economic data of late and a generally well-received US earnings season is encouraging bullish strategies, with the brave also prepared to bet on a positive outcome when details of any Euro-package are mooted to be unveiled on Wednesday.The FTSE All-World equity index was up 2.2 per cent in a market that has been adding “risk on” positions as the session progresses.The euro rallied strongly after an early dip and was up 0.8 per cent to $1.3894, while the dollar index, which traditionally displays an inverse correlation to risk appetite, was down 1 per cent. Indeed, the buck at one point hit a record low versus the yen of Y75.78, according to Reuters.Commodities were firmer, with Brent crude adding 0.2 per cent to $109.95, while perceived havens, such as US Treasuries and German Bunds, saw sellers, nudging yields higher by several basis points. Gold was up 1.2 per cent to $1,640 an ounce.Wall Street’s S&P 500 rose 1.9 per cent to 1,238, its highest close since August, and above resistance at 1,230. Extra impetus came from well-received earning reports from General Electric, Honeywell and McDonald’s.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 advanced 2.5 per cent, with the banking sub-index leading the charge on a gain of 3.8 per cent, as investors reckon a support mechanism to stave off Eurozone sovereign debt contagion will be delivered within the next several days.Despite the broadly bullish mood, investors will be aware that any negative news, chatter or speculation over the progress being made by the eurozone to contain the region’s sovereign debt crisis could see sentiment turn on a dime.This has been a stark feature of recent sessions, with assets vacillating in response to reports that point to progress or disagreement.That said, it was noticeable that Wall Street on Thursday appeared able to escape the clutches of eurozone angst and carve out a gain based primarily on reduced fears that the US economy could face a double-dip recession.A surprise expansion in the mid-Atlantic region’s factory activity – it’s strongest performance in six months – bolstered investor stoicism, and it looks like that has been carried over into Friday’s session.Still, traders remain nervous. The S&P 500 may be at the top of its 2½ -month, 120 point range, but the Vix index, a measure of expected market volatility that is considered a good gauge of investor anxiety, remains elevated at 32.Earlier in the session, Asian markets posted modest gains as banks and technology shares were lifted by cautious optimism for a comprehensive rescue package for the eurozone in coming days.The FTSE Asia Pacific index is up 0.2 per cent. South Korean construction firms rallied as the death of Libyan dictator Muammer Gaddafi boosted hopes for the resumption of stalled construction projects in Libya, pushing the Kospi index up 1.8 per centTechnology shares in Tokyo and Seoul were initially supported by Microsoft reporting a modest profit gain and after SanDisk beat Wall Street estimates. The Nikkei 225 closed barely changed, however, typifying dealers’ reluctance to take big punts in case weekend Eurozone events scupper strategies.Gains in the region were limited by declines in resources stocks after Thursday’s sharp fall in copper prices, and this left Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index with a loss of 0.1 per cent.…..Trading Post.To maintain financial health one should always listen to the doctor: Dr Copper, that is.The red metal is so named because it is considered most erudite in its forecasting of global economic activity. Copper is not immune to daily risk on/off switches but its fundamentals demand respect, argue its disciples.If true, global equity investors should be nervous.The Shanghai copper future was limit down – a fall of 6 per cent to a 16-month low – on Thursday. It rallied 1.5 per cent on Friday, but the recent stumble is a function of demand concerns rather than a reflection of supply increases.Freeport-McMoRan, the biggest quoted copper producer, this week cut its sales forecast for next year.A slower pace of Chinese growth is meeting worries over the economic health of the US and eurozone. Funding difficulties in China as Beijing seeks to restrict speculation are also weighing and this has contributed to the Shanghai Composite index falling on Friday to a fresh 31-month trough, down another 0.6 per cent on the day.Some western investors tend to be pretty sniffy about the SCI, but a drop to March 2009 levels should not be so quickly dismissed.Note, the US-traded copper contract has not matched the equity market’s bounce of the past few weeks.

135;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-10-12T21:40:22Z;GE’s bright sparks take the lead;;"I was told two things about this group,” the lecturer announces. “This is GE: one – don’t be boring; two – don’t make them touch.”A chuckle of self-recognition ripples round the 60 General Electric managers. They should be in good humour. They have just enjoyed a good lunch outdoors. The sun is shining. Down in the valley, the Hudson river is glittering. The presenter is compelling and witty. Finally, their presence at Crotonville, a 45-minute train ride north of Manhattan, for this residential course is a sign that they are in the ascendant at one of the world’s largest and best-known companies.Indeed, Crotonville (officially, the John F Welch Leadership Development Center, named after GE’s high-profile former boss, though no one ever calls it that) is at the heart of what may be GE’s most important production line: the one for leaders.Only one person can be chief executive, but although the attrition rate of the top 650 managers in the company is low, at under 3 per cent annually, GE alumni crop up in executive suites across the corporate world (see below). They include the current chief executives of ABB, Honeywell and Boeing, for instance. The chances are high that they completed a Crotonville course. Jeff Immelt, who has just passed his 10th anniversary as chief executive, was taught in “The Pit” – the main lecture theatre at the New York campus – by his predecessor Mr Welch, who himself took a one-week marketing course there in the 1960s, as a young manager.GE bought Crotonville – lock, stock and library – from the estate of the late Harry Hopf, who had established a management institute on the wooded hills overlooking the Hudson. By the time Jack Welch ordered its refubishment in the 1980s it was, in the former GE boss’s words, “a quarter of a century old – and unfortunately looked it”. The latest project to “reimagine Crotonville” aims to transform it into a 21st century campus, with the construction of new buildings and the remodelling of others. For instance, by May 2012, GE will have transformed the clapboard “White House” at the centre of the 59-acre site – a clubhouse where GE employees can relax after their courses – into a modern, wired meeting place, featuring double-height ceilings and a high-concept Cafe ‘56 (named after the year GE launched its leadership programmes). In line with the globalisation of the Crotonville programme, Cafe 56s will be established in all the research and training centres around the world.Fifty years ago, training was founded on chairman Ralph Cord­iner’s “Blue Books” – a set of gruelling instructions about how to manage. “It was a lot about telling,” says Peter Cavanaugh, operations manager at the centre. “Now it’s more about reflection.”But Crotonville is no Trappist retreat, fixated on the values of a Cordiner or a Welch. To help kick off the courses, Susan Peters, GE’s ebullient chief learning officer, challenges participants: “Are you using the same cell phone you used five years ago? No, because capabilities have changed and your expectations have changed – and that’s the same with leadership.”GE has itself spent two years re­thinking the physical infrastructure of the site (see box), and what and how it teaches future leaders. More than ever, they are likely to be drawn from non-US markets, in line with the shifting emphasis of the group’s operations. In the process, GE has to work out how to tap the energy and sharpen the expertise of its international workforce, while instilling a common culture and purpose.The thoroughness of the group’s re-examination of its leadership development would put many business schools to shame. In spring 2009, the group invited management thinkers – from Colonel Thomas Kolditz of the US Military Academy at West Point to Insead professor Herminia Ibarra – to dinner with GE officers, to discuss the future of leadership. That September, 35 senior GE executives fanned out around the world to gather views on how others were developing leaders. They visited about 100 organisations, including the Chinese Communist party’s central school, Toyota, Embraer, and the Boston Celtics basketball team.On the basis of what it learnt, GE reworked its “growth values” – external focus, clear thinking, imagination and courage, inclusiveness, and expertise. Mr Immelt relaunched them at a meeting of the top 650 executives in Florida last January, updating its curriculum accordingly. “Externally focused” leaders, for instance, are now trained not just to cultivate customer relationships but to analyse global trends and spot opportunities.GE offers two broad types of training: “programmes”, which mix job rotations and classes; and the more traditional one- to three-week residential leadership courses. It aims to ensure staff can apply what they learnt in the lecture theatre once they are back in the office or factory.Peter Lorange, former president of IMD, the Swiss business school, and now head of his own Lorange Institute of Business, admires the GE approach, although he says some companies – notably Nestlé – go even further. “It’s more important than ever to strengthen the link between learning on the job and learning at the school,” he says.In line with this trend away from a physical “corporate university”, GE has devolved more training to take to its research centres around the world. Of 25,000 employees who took a “Crotonville” class last year, 15,000 never visited the bucolic campus. The challenge is to ensure both that the curriculum is taught consistently – and that it remains relevant to top managers. About half of the top 5,000 are likely to be non-Americans by 2021 against 35 per cent today and 17 per cent ten years ago.All the courses have “a Crotonville feel”, whether they take place in Bangalore, Shanghai or, in due course, Rio de Janeiro, where a new GE research centre is being built. GE also tries to offset national differences that might hamper training. For example, having spotted that US managers were good at talking, but perhaps not as good at listening, GE “now majors people on listening”, says Ms Peters: “It’s something we have to really work on, to equal the playing field between our American leaders and our non-American leaders.”…The group disputes the suggestion that it uses a “cookie-cutter” to churn out American or Americanised leaders to follow the last three chief executives, Reg Jones (who was actually born in the UK), Messrs Welch and Immelt.Expatriate managers for GE in markets such as India and China are supposed to look for their successors locally. The approach reflects that: local trainers adapt courses to local sensibilities, while managers in the classes are encouraged to feed in their regional perspective.Ms Peters draws a parallel with GE’s handheld ultrasound scanner. Developed for, and in, China, it is now marketed in the US.The message seems clear. Ralph Cordiner might not recognise the modern Crotonville. But just as new innovations are emerging from what used to be the periphery of GE’s empire, so GE is sourcing its leadership training – and increasingly the leaders themselves – from well beyond the Hudson valley.……………………………………………………………..An executive diasporaJeff Immelt CEO of GE since 2001.

136;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-09-18T19:00:59Z;UTC examines bid for Goodrich;;United Technologies Corporation, the US industrial conglomerate, has been examining a possible acquisition of aerospace company Goodrich Corporation, people familiar with the situation said.The Connecticut-headquartered UTC, whose subsidiaries make helicopters, aircraft engines and elevators, had sounded out banks about possible funding for a takeover, one of the people said. However, the people cautioned that a deal may not ultimately take place and that United Technologies had considered a number of possible targets, including companies in Europe.Goodrich, which has a US parent company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, makes landing gear, aircraft interiors and electronic sensors and other components for the commercial aerospace and defence sectors. It has a market capitalisation of $11.6bn and revenues of around $7bn in 2010, about one-third of which come from high margin after-market sales.Industry analysts argue that it is well placed to benefit as air travel picks up and a new generation of widebody aircraft enter service.Another third of its revenues come from the defence sector, however, and Pentagon spending is set to flatten over the next few years.Some industry specialists believe Rockwell Collins – which provides the aerospace and defence industry with communication and electronic devices – is also a likely target for United Technologies. Both it and Goodrich saw their stocks rise Friday on speculation of a bid.UTC declined to comment, and Goodrich was not immediately available.United Technologies New York listed shares closed down 0.15 per cent Friday at $75.50, giving it a market capitalisation of $68.6bn. It reached a peak of $91 in July. Goodrich shares closed up 7.4 per cent at $92.89.A bid for Goodrich would represent UTC’s biggest prospective deal since its shortlived attempt to purchase Honeywell, the aerospace and defence company, for about $40bn in 2000. UTC was eventually outbid by General Electric, only for GE’s offer to be stymied by European regulators.In recent years UTC has focused on using midsized acquisitions to create new business lines. Since 2005 it has purchased a string of companies to build its fire and security unit, including GE’s security business, for about $1.8bn in 2009.UTC has made no secret of its desire to do larger deals, although executives have consistently repeated their concern not to overpay.“As you’ve seen in the past with the GE Security acquisition, we have the appetite, and the capacity for large acquisitions and we know how to integrate them well,” Greg Hayes, chief financial officer of UTC, said in July. The company had $5.4bn of cash at the end of the second quarter.Robert Stallard, analyst at RBC said: “[United Technologies] is well capitalised, corporate debt rates are near historical low, and the recent market sell off has potentially made purchase prices a little more attractive.”
137;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
138;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-09-08T15:42:22Z;US manufacturers feel weight of baby boomers;;The US’s biggest industrial companies face an average bill of at least $100m each over the next five years as they struggle to fill the skills gaps left by the looming retirement of “baby boomer” factory workers, according to a survey of manufacturers to be released today.The survey by The Nielsen Company of 100 top executives at US manufacturing companies underlines the scale of the demographic problem facing the US economy. In recent decades, apprenticeships and workplace training have been gradually downgraded, to the extent that many manufacturers now complain they cannot find the skilled workers they need in spite of stubbornly high unemployment.Mechanics and engineers from the baby-boom generation – born in the two decades following the second world war – formed the backbone of the US’s industrial workforce from the 1960s onwards. However, the first baby boomers become eligible for retirement this year, raising the spectre that the skills gap could worsen sharply in the next few years.Some 55 per cent of industrial companies with annual revenues of at least $1bn expect skills shortages prompted by retirements to cost them at least $100m in the next five years, they said in a survey conducted for Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include companies such as Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron.Most of the costs will be accounted for by recruiting, training and overtime costs, said Jeff Owens, ATS chief executive. He said the costs also take into account the likelihood that equipment would not be operated for part of the time because of a lack of qualified maintenance staff. “You’re talking about falling productivity and a shorter life for fixed assets in factories,” Mr Owens said.Rick Stephens, senior vice-president of human resources at Boeing, the aircraft maker, said his company is well aware of the problem. “Like most aerospace companies, we have a workforce that is more on the mature side,” he said.Mr Stephens said Boeing spends about $80m annually in workforce training. “We’ve also significantly increased spending in the past year to train up new employees to ensure they’re qualified to go into the production environment,” he said.The problem of the looming retirement of highly experienced workers, Mr Stephens said, has been aggravated by the fact that new recruits tend to be far less technically skilled than entry-level workers were decades ago. In response, Boeing recently doubled its introductory training course from 6-7 weeks to 13 weeks.Mr Owens said the recession had enabled manufacturers to avoid facing the retirement issue. “Companies have put this problem off for a long time because it’s not been pressing,” he said. “But many companies are starting to discover how urgent it is when they look at the average age of their workforce.”The survey also found that 45 per cent of companies are encouraging older workers to delay their retirements as they face the prospect of losing skilled staff, while employees are keen to rebuild their recession-hit pension funds.“The folks that we expected to retire, the age has been extended a bit because of the economy’s effects on peoples’ savings and retirement plans,” said Mr Stephens.Mr Owens said that could help postpone the problem, but could not overcome it. He also noted that older skilled workers tend to be less productive.“Manufacturers have assumed they can simply hire people when they need them, but when they start to look, they realise how difficult it is to hire.” Half of the survey respondents said they had 11 or more open positions for skilled workers, with one-third having more than 20 unfilled vacancies.
139;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-08-28T18:07:58Z;Network pools resources to reap solid rewards;;In the internet age, in which virtually everyone has the capability to contact everyone else, the power of personal recommendation still carries weight.Ten specialist UK manufacturers have formed an unusual consortium in which they abandon the normal codes of commercial confidentiality, passing to each other contact details about customers and suppliers, with a view to building up sales for the group as a whole.The most important pieces of information passed on invariably come not through electronic networks, but via scraps of market intelligence communicated during informal monthly meetings at each other’s premises.“We had a few arguments to start with but we’ve gradually built up trust and learned to work with each other,” says David Spears, managing director of Brandauer, a parts manufacturer which is one of the 10 members of the five-year-old alliance, called the Midlands Assembly Network (Man).Steve Blower, managing director of Wrekin Circuits, a maker of printed circuit boards, says: “Normally in business you win sales solely as a result of your own endeavours. With our system, you have the combined efforts of 10 companies working on your behalf.”The businesses – all based in or around Birmingham – are each in a specific area of metals-related manufacturing with a set of skills that does not conflict with other members.“It’s important that no-one competes with each other directly, which is a vital factor in keeping disagreements to a minimum,” says Gerry Dunne, managing director of Westley Engineering, which makes metal pressed parts.Mr Spears says of the individual enterprises in the group that all are “widget makers with the ability to do something different”.His 149-year-old business last year made 1.4bn tiny metal components for goods such as electric sockets and plumbing fittings, with 30 per cent of its expected £10m sales this year likely to come from China.The companies – which typically make parts according to specific customer orders with each new batch resulting from a new design – have a monthly meeting somewhere in the Midlands.Each is allowed to send two people to thrash out grievances – such as complaints that sales leads have not been passed on quickly enough – and discuss common issues.“Two years ago during the recession we were all going through a torrid time, and it was hugely helpful to meet to compare notes,” says Alan Rollason, managing director of Ace Chemical Etching, which makes small electric circuits.Of the others in Man, the biggest is PP Electrical Systems, a 190-employee company making control panels, and with sales last year of £24m. Between them, the 10 companies had combined revenues in 2010 of about £65m, and have some 650 employees.Customers of the individual businesses – whose other members are in sectors from aluminium casting to making electric wiring harnesses – include the US industrial group Honeywell, the Rolls-Royce aero-engine company and Yamazaki Mazak, the big Japanese machine tool producer.In the Man system, the network received about 50 inquiries for orders a month via a special website. The individual businesses take it in turns to receive calls on a general phone number to handle general queries and complaints.But the most important part of the process is that each member is expected to scout for business on behalf of the others, using its network of customers.“If my company is working for a specific business which needs a manufacturing competence that I can’t provide, I will suggest to my customer that I know someone else who might be able to do the job,” says Justin Anstey, business development manager at Barkley Plastic, a maker of injection mouldings.In a similar manner, the group co-ordinates a data base with details of trusted suppliers, to enable Man businesses to tap into an extended global supply chain.Each of the 10 pays £10,000 a year to finance a shared website plus general marketing efforts, such as taking stands in trade exhibitions. Bureaucracy is minimised by each group handling sales gained via the network individually, with no pooling of accounts data or information about prices.Mr Spears says the efforts have paid off – and could form the basis for similar collaborative groups elsewhere. “Since Man started, we’ve together won contracts worth tens of millions of pounds which, without the power of the group, individual businesses would probably never even have heard about,” he says.
140;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-08-18T21:52:01Z;Industry feels the sting of US defence cuts;;Faced with the prospect of substantial reductions in US military spending, leading defence contractors, analysts and investors are all dialling back their expectations for the sector even as the industry ramps up its lobbying efforts to forestall bigger cuts.“I don’t think it’s any secret that the defence budget is a very difficult one right now,” Jim Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and a former head of Boeing’s $32bn defence unit, told investors at a conference in New York last week.“The Department of Defense is going to have to take out between $800bn and $1,000bn over the next 10 years. There are not a lot of discretionary knobs that they can turn … It’s going to be a tough marketplace for a while to come without question,” he said.“Defence budgets are, and will continue to be, under pressure and this is a minus that few defence contractors will avoid,” Charles Mathis, chief financial officer of Force Protection, a maker of armoured vehicles, told the same conference.British defence companies – which have invested $20bn in a US expansion drive over the past decade – are also experiencing falling sales and scaling back growth expectations. Rolls-Royce has already been directly affected by the cuts, after the US Congress decided it would stop funding an alternative engine Rolls was developing for the new F-35 fighter aeroplane.Behind the uptick in concern lies the recent congressional deal over the federal debt ceiling. Under that agreement the Pentagon will be hit by about $350bn of cuts over the next decade in the first wave of action – roughly in line with previous expectations.Honeywell, which sells aircraft engines and other kit to the military, expects the base budget to decline about 1 to 2 per cent a year over the next decade, resulting in a 2 per cent to 4 per cent annual decline in revenues for its defence unit for three years.But as part of the jury-rigged compromise, the DoD could also be subject to a further round of about $500bn in automatic cuts if a panel of politicians fails to agree on substantial spending reductions designed to shrink the federal deficit.“[The deal] could trim the nation’s defence budget by more than 10 per cent over the next decade. We expect these budget cuts to affect the large prime contractors and to ripple across the supply chain to smaller, specialised providers,” analysts at Moody’s wrote.The rating agency expects average defence margins to fall below 10 per cent as companies compete more aggressively for a “smaller pie” which could pressure earnings and cash flow and “eventually lead to ratings downgrades for some contractors”.Doug Harned, with Bernstein Research, argues that any automatic cuts could be particularly painful because they would probably be evenly distributed between 2013 and 2021. Normally defence cuts are backloaded giving the Pentagon plenty of wiggle room.In response to the elevated risks, defence stock prices have fallen faster than the market. Over the past month, aerospace and defence shares in the S&P500, including companies such as Raytheon, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, have tumbled about 18 per cent, while the broader index has dropped about 13 per cent.Industry lobby groups are still fighting the cuts. The Aerospace Industries Association has stepped up its efforts to “educate” congressmen about the importance of defence spending to national security and the economy.In September, it will officially launch a website called secondtonone.org that argues “American leadership in aerospace and defence is being threatened by forces in Congress and the administration.”Still, while acknowledging the more difficult outlook, executives from Boeing, Honeywell and other defence companies insist that their businesses will hold up thanks to advantages such as exposure to priority parts of the budget and international growth.Michael Madsen, president of Honeywell’s defence and space unit, expects to see increased demand from countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, while Mr Albaugh says Boeing aims to generate 25 per cent of its defence sales abroad within a decade.Moreover, somewhat counter-intuitively, the share slide may be a positive for certain investors, argues Rob Stallard, of RBC Capital Markets. “Many value investors are wondering if the 10-year defence downcycle is pretty much priced in,” he wrote to clients recently.“The dividend yield on some defence companies is now over 4 per cent. And so with limited downside in the stocks, and a healthy coupon, this could be seen as appealing to those with an income slant.”
141;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-08-07T16:47:00Z;US regulators warn utilities over cyberattacks;;US regulators have warned electricity utilities to protect themselves from hacking attacks involving a simpler variation of the Stuxnet program that damaged Iran’s nuclear infrastructure last year.The attacks target a common type of programmable equipment that is used to control power generation as well as various factory processes.The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (Nerc) issued an alert hours before a security researcher showed at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas last week that he could break into programmable logic controllers – computers that control automated processes – made by Siemens even if they were protected by passwords. Other researchers at the conference said criminals and intelligence agencies would be able to use the internet to hack into controllers made by other companies as well.Researcher Dillon Beresford of NSS Labs warned of widespread vulnerabilities in machines that are installed in tens of thousands of utilities and other industries. Siemens has fixed some of the issues – though it is up to customers to install the patches – and has begun work on others.“We have an ongoing process to develop mitigation strategies and will post these to our service and support website on testing and completion,” Frank Garrabrant, a Siemens industry automation official, said in a written statement.With the recommendations to utilities in the US and Canada, “we will take some of that risk off the table”, said Tim Roxey, Nerc director of risk assessment. “The true solution is clearly not in the short term, it is mid to long term at a minimum”.Some of the problems will take years to fix. Siemens’ machinery is set up to be able to communicate with similar controllers from General Electric and Honeywell. The industry standards do not call for those transmissions to be encrypted, which makes them easier targets for hackers.Controllers had been ignored by hackers and researchers for decades because they relied on specialised programming languages and are often not connected to the internet.That changed last year, when Iran conceded that its nuclear programme had been damaged by the malicious Stuxnet program, which infected hundreds of thousands of personal computers and spread itself as it looked for the small number that had Siemens software installed. Once it found that software, known as Step7, it looked for a certain configuration that would only appear with a set kind of centrifuges. Then it issued commands that disabled them and hid its tracks.Stuxnet has been called the first true cyberweapon. But Mr Beresford said his research showed that similar attacks would not need to be nearly as complex. Among other things, he found that he could bypass the Step7 software and issue commands to the equipment directly, assuming that the facility’s network was connected to the internet. If the facility was isolated, it could be penetrated with a handheld storage device.“It is only a matter of time before criminal elements get their hands on this type of code,” he said. “We need better access controls” on the equipment.John Pollet, whose Red Tiger Security has performed security audits for oil and gas companies for years, said that Mr Beresford had “opened a can of worms”.“There is a systemic problem across all control-system vendors”, Mr Pollet said. “We as an industry did it to ourselves by begging for open systems and protocols. Now the pendulum has started swinging back – we need to ask for secure systems.”
142;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-08-03T19:02:51Z;Industrial groups ring alarm bells;;Leading industrial executives have sounded stark warnings that risks to the global economy are increasing, growth is slowing and that customers are growing more cautious.While European and US industrial groups mostly delivered robust first-half results and maintained their guidance on their full-year earnings, confidence has dimmed as the manufacturing recovery shows signs of losing steam.Emerson Electric Co, the US industrial conglomerate, gave one of the starkest corporate warnings yet in a regulatory filing last week:“Emerson order growth remained solid …but we have seen a definite weakening of general business activity in June and July,’’ the company said. “US and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft-patch and it remains unclear if they will improve much in the second half of the calendar year.’’Joe Kaeser, chief financial officer of Siemens, said there had been a slowdown in investment by some of the conglormerate’s export-orientated customers in the Mittelstand, Germany’s industrial base of small and medium-sized companies.“It’s not yet a structural economic change but as we’ve seen in the past a negative change of our customers’ investment behaviour can of course lead to a slowing of economic growth,” he said.Industrial companies’ concerns span the debt problems in US and eurozone, a possible slowdown in China, the risk of overheating in other emerging markets and the effect of rising raw materials costs.Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker by sales, cautioned that “volatility in interest and exchange-rate trends and commodities prices” would temper earnings growth, even as it boosted its guidance on its full-year earnings last week.Kurt Bock, chief executive of BASF, the world’s largest chemical maker by sales, said the persistently high oil price was “having a negative impact on margins across our value chains and is leading to some customers being more cautious in their orders”.The comments represent a departure from the optimism of a year ago, when corporate order books filled up rapidly as companies in emerging markets rushed to invest in capital goods to fuel the recovery.“The true macro environment is one of uncertainty and challenge,” said Dave Anderson, chief financial officer of Honeywell, the US conglomerate. “I call it a grinding sub-par recovery,” although he noted that Honeywell continues to achieve “respectable” growth.“The $64,000 question is how long the industrial economy can keep outperforming the broader economy,” he added.
143;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-07-27T18:02:37Z;US groups hit as tax keeps cash overseas;;As much as half US companies’ record $1,240bn in cash balances is being held overseas, according to Moody’s research, with groups wary of incurring a 35 per cent repatriation tax.The foreign holdings are limiting corporate flexibility in managing balance sheets and adding to pressure from the business community for wide-ranging tax reforms.While debates rages in Washington about the state of public finances, the rating agency said on Wednesday that cash held by non-financial companies had risen 11.2 per cent during 2010, even as capital expenditure, deal-making and distributions to shareholders increased.Strength in overseas operations, as well as aggressive international tax planning, suggests growth in foreign cash is outpacing that at home. Moody’s estimated that $500bn to $700bn of the total is held abroad.The figures could fuel debate about reform of the US tax system, under which companies face a hit of up to 35 per cent in repatriating foreign earnings.A group of US lawmakers in May proposed legislation to give US companies a temporary tax holiday, apeing a 2004 reduction in the tax rate when about $300bn was returned to the US.But the administration opposes the idea, with evidence suggesting repatriated funds were returned to shareholders rather than invested in job creation.The last tax holiday may have exacerbated the problem. “The irony of the repatriation holiday was that it created a mentality of more aggressive international tax planning,” said one tax specialist. “It encouraged [putting] facilities, employees and cash-generation offshore.”With limited disclosure around overseas cash, analysts and investors could seek reassurance from companies that they are not hamstrung by the issue. ““If, as we believe, companies are unlikely to repatriate cash without another tax holiday, companies’ liquidity is not as strong as it appears,” said Steven Oman, senior vice-president at Moody’s.In sectors such as technology and healthcare where intellectual property is often held abroad, overseas balances are much higher. Companies such as Oracle and Cisco report about 90 per cent of their cash abroad.Global industrial companies, including General Electric and Honeywell, are also affected.“We have an outdated tax code that basically rewards companies or incentivises companies to keep cash offshore,” David Anderson, chief financial officer of Honeywell told the Financial Times. “It artificially distorts your investment incentives and …in the US you have to borrow because a lot of your cash is used for dividend and other payments.”But some experts question the benefits of reform, especially while US companies have uninvested cash piles at home.“Companies would rather have a system that does not recognise a taxable event just from the movement of cash,” said Stephen Shay, tax professor at Harvard Law School. “But the costs of having a second-best system are not obvious, beyond the marginal additional cost of borrowing in the US when needed.”US companies have been deploying overseas cash in international mergers and acquisitions, such as Microsoft’s $8.5bn deal to buy Luxembourg-based Skype.They have also increasingly made use of complicated structures, which use internal reorganisations as part of US deals to bring cash home. Those work best, say experts, where a target’s value is predominantly in patents and intellectual property.

145;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-05-02T20:33:13Z;CEOs’ mantra requires vigilance;Gap between thought, word and deed is often large;Effective immediately. The phrase – often attached to urgent appointments or dismissals of front-line staff – could be a mantra for chief executives. It is a two-word summary of what many business leaders believe is their purpose: to get things done now. It seems to say: “Not only did I identify the problem, but by the time you read this, I will have dealt with it and moved on to the next challenge.”Yet the gap between thought, word and deed in modern management of any company is often a large one. Bridging it successfully is an unending task, requiring constant attention.In the all-too-brief interlude of corporate self-examination that followed the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the scandals of the early 2000s, Larry Bossidy, hard-headed former chief executive of AlliedSignal and Honeywell, and academic and consultant Ram Charan found a sweet spot in management literature with two books, Execution and Confronting Reality, that took business leaders to task for neglecting the “how” of their jobs in favour of highfalutin discussion of strategy.Bossidy and Charan’s second book underlined the point that chief executives who fell prey to “the six habits of highly unrealistic leaders” (selective hearing, wishful thinking, emotional overinvestment and so on) would fail. Among leaders they praised for their ultra-realistic approach was Cisco Systems’ John Chambers for the way he had led the company out of the dotcom bust.Nine years on, Mr Chambers, who has been at the helm of the US technology equipment company since 1995, is suddenly having to confront reality again. In an internal memo last month, he defended the core strategy of supplying the kit that makes networks more competitive, but criticised the company for poor execution, sluggish decision-making and a loss of focus, discipline and accountability. He and his chief operating officer (appointed in February, “effective immediately”), have started a process of simplification and internal restructuring.Latterly, Cisco has expanded too fast in too many directions. For a company that specialises in supplying the plumbing of the internet – switchers and other hardware sold to business customers – the move into consumer products such as the Flip video camera was the equivalent of branching out into showerheads and shaving mirrors. Within days of his memo, Mr Chambers announced the business would be closed.But the management challenge for Cisco, which still holds a powerful position in its core business, also looks similar to that facing Nokia, where Stephen Elop, another chief executive who chose to voice his concerns in a memo, is trying to instil more accountability into a market leader that has lost focus. Like the Finnish mobile phone maker, Cisco faces competitors, such as Hewlett-Packard, Juniper Networks and Huawei of China, that are gnawing at its core business with products perceived as cheaper or more innovative. Like Nokia, Cisco has a series of cross-functional internal boards criticised for adding to the complexity of decision-making – though there is no sign as yet that Mr Chambers, their architect, wants to demolish them, as Mr Elop has.The difference is that while Mr Chambers continues to adhere to the strategy he has followed for a decade or more, Mr Elop – as a new chief executive – is pursuing a path that breaks with the past, by allying with Microsoft as software provider for Nokia’s smartphones.Bossidy and Charan were taken to task for implying in their first book that leadership was mainly about action not reflection, execution not strategy. It is a false distinction. In certain circumstances – including those now faced by Cisco – it is important to change how the company works, rather than what it does. In others – as at Nokia – executives need to address both areas simultaneously. But the consequence of neglecting either is the same.In his memo, Mr Chambers managed deftly to indulge in self-criticism (for missing the problem) and self-congratulation (for spotting it). He wrote that “responsibility [for the transition] does not fall on one leader or one team”. But if the leader says his strategy is sound and it is not, or champions better execution and then fails to improve it, the leader will take the fall. Effective immediately.andrew.hill@ft.com
146;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T00:30:00+0000;Materials costs squeeze US industry;;Rising prices for commodities such as oil and steel and inflation in emerging economies are a threat to the revival of US manufacturing industry, executives at some of the leading companies have warned.Manufacturers such as United Technologies, Honeywell, Eaton, Ford Motor and Boeing have been reporting stronger-than-expected earnings for the first quarter and often raising their forecasts of growth for the full year.The industrial sector has been the second strongest in the S&P 500 this year, outperformed only by energy.While manufacturers’ confidence in the global outlook has been growing, concerns about rising commodity prices, inflation in emerging economies, and the policy responses to those price rises have become increasingly pressing. This year, oil has risen by 22 per cent for benchmark Brent crude, while steel is up 17 per cent, driven by continuing strong demand in emerging economies and the recovery in the developed world.United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis lifts, said it had been surprised by the strength of demand right across the business.But Greg Hayes, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times: “Commodity inflation is the one thing that really concerns us this year.”The threat is not so much the squeeze on margins created by higher costs, although that is having an effect. Ford warned that earnings for the rest of the year might not be as strong as in its bumper first quarter, in part because of rising raw materials costs.However, the large global manufacturers generally seem able to pass on their higher costs to their customers, albeit with a lag. Eaton, which makes industrial equipment and components, reported strong earnings growth that would have been even stronger but for a delay in raising its prices, but said that was only a temporary problem.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, pointed out that during 2003-07, when prices for energy and other commodities were rising steadily, the company had still been able to expand its margins.3M, the diversified manufacturer, also suffered a squeeze on margins from raw materials prices in the first quarter, but David Meline, its chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call that “for the full year 2011, selling price increases are expected to offset raw material inflation”.The real threat for these companies is that the commodity price effect might hit demand, perhaps as a result of tighter monetary or fiscal policy intended to fight inflation.David Anderson, chief financial officer of Honeywell, which makes parts for aircraft and vehicles as well as industrial equipment, said: “The industrial economy is doing very well, despite the challenging headlines.”But he added that the greatest risk he saw was “if we have significantly greater commodity inflation and an oil price shock to the economy, and geopolitical instability, which could be interrelated.”There are winners as well as losers from higher oil prices. General Electric has been rapidly building up its business serving the oil and gas industry, buying Wellstream for $1.3bn and the well support division of John Wood Group for $2.8bn, and rising prices will mean more demand for its services.GE also hopes that higher fuel costs will encourage customers to invest in its energy-saving equipment.Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said that a rising oil price “so long as it’s gradual, is a net positive …At the range it’s in, it’s not a real problem.”Similarly, Jim McNerney, the chief executive of Boeing, said on a call to analysts and media on Wednesday that “high-ish” oil prices could help push airlines towards buying his company’s fuel-efficient aircraft. However, he added: “The concern is if oil prices get to the point where it has a significant impact on overall economic activity.”So far, there has been little sign of that. Worldwide flight hours, for example – a key indicator for aerospace companies – rose by 5.8 per cent in the first quarter, to exceed their 2008 peak.Nor are interest rate rises in emerging economies such as Brazil and China yet having much effect on demand for US manufacturers’ products. Mr Cutler of Eaton said he remained “very positive” about those countries.While inflation has been rising in the US and Europe in recent months, it remains relatively subdued. Yet, in a world in which economic clout has shifted to Asia and Latin America, rising prices there could still be a significant threat.Additional reporting by Hal Weitzman in Chicago
147;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-04-26T19:20:03Z;S&P higher after strong US results;;A batch of strong results from leading US companies including Ford Motor, UPS and 3M helped push the S&P 500 index to its highest level since June 2008 in a sign of rising market confidence in spite of concerns about the world economy.Ford, the second-largest US car company by revenues, reported its highest quarterly profit for the period in 13 years, in the latest sign of the revival in US manufacturing.UPS, the logistics company, and 3M, the diversified manufacturer, raised their guidance for full-year earnings after first-quarter profits beat analysts’ expectations. Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor, also raised its full-year projection.The news follows excellent results from industrial companies such as United Technologies, Eaton and Honeywell.Of the 154 constituents of the S&P 500 that have reported earnings for the first quarter, 122 have delivered earnings ahead of average expectations, according to Bloomberg data.The S&P 500 index was 0.9 per cent up at 1347 by midday in New York and up 7.1 per cent this year. The rally this year has been led by the energy sector, which has risen 16 per cent, followed by the industrial sector and healthcare, which are both up 10 per cent.The benchmark has nearly doubled from its low of 676 set in March 2009, during the financial crisis, but is still 14 per cent below its all-time high of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007.Ford’s first-quarter earnings were $2.55bn, up 22 per cent on a year earlier and far ahead of analysts’ estimates. The company ascribed the rise to higher volumes and selling prices, as well as lower interest payments. Operating profits in Europe almost trebled, helped by new models.However, Alan Mulally, chief executive, said that despite the strong first quarter, Ford was sticking to earlier 2011 sales projections due to uncertainties.The company warned that results later in the year “may not be as strong as the first quarter”. It cited lower profits at Ford Credit, its financing arm, rising commodity prices and expanding investments, especially in emerging markets such as Russia, which Ford expects will be Europe’s biggest car market by 2015.Mr Mulally added however, that while new investments would push up costs, “they are also driving higher volumes, richer mix [of vehicles] and stronger transaction prices”.UPS also raised concerns about risks in the world economy, saying that the outlook was “a little cloudier” than it was three months ago.Ford shares climbed 2 per cent to about $15.90 at midday in New York, far above their lows of close to a dollar in late 2008, but still below January’s recent peak of almost $19.3M shares were also up about 2 per cent at $96.14, while UPS and Lockheed were both up about 1 per cent.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
148;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-04-21T21:39:24Z;Financial arm drives GE earnings growth;;General Electric, the industrial group, beat expectations with a 48 per cent rise in underlying earnings in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by another strong performance at its GE Capital financial services unit.Pressure on margins at the company’s industrial businesses, particularly for energy equipment, was offset by GE Capital’s rebound from the effects of the financial crisis.GE’s shares closed down 2.2 per cent to $19.95 on Thursday.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, said the results showed that the company had “emerged from the recession a stronger, more competitive company,” adding that its leadership “remain confident in GE’s 2011 framework”.The company also announced the third increase in its dividend in the past year.The results follow strong reports other US industrial groups including United Technologies, Honeywell and Eaton, all of which raised their guidance on expected earnings for the year.GE also reported that its tax rate, a subject of controversy in the US following claims that the company paid no federal taxes last year, had risen sharply.Pre-tax profits from continuing operations more than doubled to $7.4bn, up from $2.8bn in the equivalent quarter of 2010, but the provision for tax payments rose even faster, from $443m to $3.9bn, because of tax payable on the sale of a 51 per cent stake in NBC Universal to Comcast.That left net income from continuing operations up 48 per cent at $3.51bn, and diluted earnings per share also up 48 per cent at $0.31.Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, said he expected the tax rate for GE’s industrial businesses to be about 20 per cent for the year as a whole, and GE Capital’s rate to be in the “mid teens”, compared to 17 per cent for the industrial business and a substantial tax benefit recorded by GE Capital in 2010.As has been the case in recent quarters, the strongest contribution to profit growth came from the rebound in GE Capital, where profit more than tripled to $1.84bn thanks to lower provisions for losses.In the first quarter, GE Capital exceeded the maximum of 40 per cent that Mr Immelt has targeted for its proportion of the company’s earnings, providing a little over half of group post-tax earnings. The company expects that proportion to drop back to the 40 per cent range for the year as a whole.The group’s industrial businesses, which Mr Immelt has tried to stress as more important to the group’s future, posted organic revenue growth of 5 per cent, to $20.4bn, but pre-tax profits were up only 1 per cent, at $2.98bn.Mr Sherin said that in aerospace and other markets where GE matched other US groups, such as United Technologies and Honeywell, it had benefited from the same global market strength.However, some GE divisions, particularly energy infrastructure, generally see pick up demand later in the economic cycle.Energy infrastructure, which includes gas and wind turbines for power generation and equipment for oil and gas production, was the weakest division: profits fell 7 per cent to $1.38bn. The company said prices had been under pressure for wind turbines, and new acquisitions had also squeezed margins.GE has been aggressively adding to its energy equipment business, buying companies including Dresser and the well support unit of John Wood Group. The acquisition announced in March of Converteam, a manufacturer of power conversion equipment, will bring total spending to about $11bn.Mr Sherin said the company planned no more large deals for the rest of 2011.The quarterly dividend was raised by 1 cent to 15 cents a share, payable to shareholders on the register as of June 20. It is still less than half the peak quarterly payment of 31 cents before the financial crisis in 2008.The stock has added 7.4 per cent in value over the past year, compared to a 10.4 per cent rise for the S&P 500 index.

Global stock markets are approaching the Easter holiday in fine fettle. The wobble seen at the start of the week following S&P’s warning on US debt is already a distant memory as a rash of well-received US earnings bolsters hopes that the economic recovery is gaining strength.The FTSE All-World equity index is up 0.7 per cent to a fresh cyclical high, while traders’ keenness for racier bets sees many commodities making ground as the dollar hits its deepest rough in more than two and a half years.Wall Street is adding to Wednesday’s strong rally, with the S&P 500 up another 0.5 per cent after General Electric and Honeywell joined the roll call of companies beating analysts’ forecasts. A weaker Philadelphia Fed index for April has taken a bit of shine off the session, however.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 is up 0.4 per cent as defensives such as tobacco and healthcare underperform.Higher yielding “growth” currencies are in demand, with the Australian dollar climbing to a fresh 29-year peak above $1.07. A lack of risk aversion, however, has not caused lasting selling of core bonds, and yields are now nudging lower following the Philly Fed numbers and some mildly disappointing US weekly initial jobless claims data.Asian equities have hit their highest point in 40 months, after Apple joined other US companies over the past couple of sessions in delivering better than expected earnings.Excuse the tortured animal simile, but while bulls are cavorting like Easter bunnies, others are worried about Black Swans. Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the Vix, is near multiyear lows following this week’s post-US debt warning rally. But the CBOE’s Skew index suggests building wariness.The Skew examines out-of-the-money S&P 500 options to measure investors’ perception of tail risk that may threaten the market. It has already been dubbed the Black Swan index.Historically the Skew has moved within a range of 100-150 with an average of 115, according to the CBOE. If closer to 100, it shows that investors perceive the probability of a sharp market decline to be very small. As the Skew rises, the chances of a shock increase. As the chart shows, if the “noise” is smoothed out, the trend of the gauge over the past few years is higher. The Skew is now near 130.For traders, the question is whether the Skew is a useful predictive tool. After all, it is trying to track the probability of the improbable. Indeed, its elevation may reflect a reluctance to reduce exposure to stocks and a recognition that it may be best to take out longer-term insurance. Just in case.Optimism from the iPad maker has given another lift to global technology plays, while resource groups continue to attract buyers as many raw materials prices push upwards on investors’ switch to a growth-inspired “risk on” strategy.The FTSE Asia Pacific index excluding earthquake-ravaged Japan climbed 1.3 per cent to its best level since January 2008.South Korea’s Kospi index advanced 1.3 per cent to a record as chipmakers continued to revel in upbeat forecasts from Intel. Tokyo gained 0.8 per cent and Shanghai rose 0.7 per cent.In forex trading, the weaker dollar has seen the euro hit 16-month highs above $1.46, though it is now up 0.2 per cent at $1.4556. Sterling has bounced following better than expected retail sales and government borrowing data.The dollar index has slumped to 73.74, its lowest since August 2008, and is now down 0.3 per cent at 74.12 as traders bet that the Federal Reserve will be tardy in its move to tighten monetary policy.And yet, amid all the resurgent ebullience in the broader market, action in the precious metals space speaks of either speculative excess or a frantically blinking warning gauge.Gold has hit another record of $1,510 an ounce and is currently up 0.1 per cent to $1,504.63, while silver is up 3.1 per cent to $46.67, passing $46.24 an ounce for the first time since the Hunt brothers cornered the market in 1980.The grey metal, in particular, has gone parabolic, gaining 16.5 per cent in the past seven sessions, and is up 132.8 per cent since bursting through the $20 resistance level just seven months ago.As funds flow into the bullion market, so the list of reasons for the metals’ surge expand. Gold and silver are being bought as a hedge against inflation as oil builds price pipeline pressures, with Brent is hovering near $124 a barrel.Gold and silver are also being bought as investors fret about the fiscal positions of many of the developed economies, in particular the eurozone. A corollary to this is that some investors fear currency debasement, and gold is perceived by its fans as an alternative currency.Finally, gold and silver are being bought because the dollar specifically is tumbling.If one believes in the rationale behind bullion investment to start with, then all of these reasons for increasing exposure to gold can make sense.But the weaker dollar aside, sovereign debt worries and rampant inflation – for to justify such a move in gold, surely the inflation must be of the rampant variety – are not conducive to such optimism towards stocks, argue the bears.For example, Brazil on Wednesday raised interest rates from 11.75 per cent to 12 per cent in an attempt to combat inflation, while Greek bond yields suggest a restructuring that could batter exposed European banks.It is therefore tempting, bullion-wary traders argue, to see the real reason for the latest run-up in gold and silver as pretty much the same driver of the broad risk asset rally: Federal Reserve largesse. That is due to end in June.Reporting by Jamie Chisholm in London and Michael Stothard in New York
150;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-04-21T20:30:41Z;Dow Jones hits 33-month high;;A slew of strong earnings reports from big industry names such as Apple and General Electric helped boost Wall Street for another session and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 33-month high.Apple’s second-quarter results blew past forecasts, with the company posting a 95 per cent jump in earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. The technology giant reported earnings of $5.99bn in the quarter, or $6.40 a share, sharply ahead of the $5.37 expected by analysts.The results were helped by strong sales in iPhones and Mac computers, but the company said that it was struggling to produce enough of its latest version of the iPad to meet demand. Shares in the company closed up 2.4 per cent to $350.69 on Thursday.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Qualcomm climbed 3 per cent to $56.94 after the world’s leading mobile phone chipmaker by sales reported second-quarter earnings of 86 cents a share, exceeding the 80 cents expected by analysts.The company also raised its 2011 forecasts significantly as it eyed an expansion into tablets, e-readers and home consumer electronics.These bumper results pushed the S&P technology index up 1 per cent, adding to the 2.4 per cent jump the previous session following similarly strong results from Intel and IBM.This led Wall Street higher on Thursday, helping the S&P 500 index close 0.5 per cent higher at 1,337.38 in low volume trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,505.84, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,820.16.The S&P 500 and the Dow were both up 1.3 per cent over the week.Sentiment was held back slightly after the Philadelphia Fed announced that its index of regional business activity fell to 18.5 in April, down from 43.4 in March and below the 35 expected. Separately, the number of weekly jobless claims declined, but by less than expected, and the previous week’s figures were revised up.In the industrial sector, General Electric beat expectations with a 48 per cent rise in underlying earnings for the first quarter, driven almost entirely by another strong performance at its GE Capital financial services unit. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 15 cents, the third dividend increase in the last year.But investors had been hoping for even more and the stock was down 2.2 per cent to $19.95. The stock had been up 1.8 per cent on the week before the results as sentiment in the industrial sector was higher following strong results from other key players.In the previous session, United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, reported forecast-beating earnings while Eaton and Honeywell also reported strong results.Looking to the financial sector, shares in Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $26.48 after the investment bank also reported forecast-beating quarterly results. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding some items, were 46 cents a share, compared with the 40 cents expected by analysts.While the results beat expectations, in absolute terms they were less impressive. MorganStanley reported a 48 per cent drop in first-quarter profits as its joint brokerage venture with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group posted a $1.8bn annual loss and revenue from fixed-income trading fell by a third.Earnings results so far for the financial sector have been mixed. Goldman Sachs reported strong results on Tuesday, powered by strong revenues from its investing and lending divisions. But other results from Wells Fargo and Bank of America have been more disappointing, with results weighed down by troubled mortgage operations.Elsewhere on Wall Street, F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 7.2 per cent to $106.87 after reporting a 68 per cent boost to second-quarter profit and raising its earnings forecast for the current quarter above analysts’ expectations.Shares in McDonald’s fell 1.9 per cent to $76.91 after the restaurant chain warned that higher food costs could cut into margins, while its earnings came in ahead of analysts’ estimates with an 11 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.Verizon Communications slid 2.3 per cent to $36.91 after its first-quarter profit more than tripled, but its average revenue per user rose by less than analysts had expected.
151;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-04-21T01:08:08Z;Industrial groups upbeat despite global troubles;;"Three of the largest US industrial groups, United Technologies, Eaton and Honeywell, posted strong first-quarter results and raised guidance for expected earnings growth, in a sign of rising confidence in the world economy.United Technologies, the aerospace and buildings equipment group, reported a 17 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings, led by a strong performance at its Carrier air-conditioning unit.Eaton, which makes electrical equipment and components for vehicles and aircraft, reported an 80 per cent increase in earnings per share, with particularly strong growth from its hydraulics and truck component businesses.Both companies said markets were growing more strongly than they had expected, in spite of threats posed by rising prices for oil and other commodities, inflation in key emerging economies and the effects of the devastating earthquake in Japan.Connecticut-based United Technologies reported pre-tax income of $1.63bn for the first quarter, up 21 per cent from the equivalent period of 2010, and earnings of $1.11 per share, up 19 per cent.The company, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Sikorsky helicopters and other aerospace and building systems, raised its full-year earnings forecast by 5 cents to a range of $5.25-$5.40 per share, representing 11-14 per cent growth on 2010. It also said it expected full-year sales to be 5 per cent higher at about $57bn.Greg Hayes, the chief financial officer, said: “Across the business, everything has been doing better than we expected and the downside risks just haven’t materialised.”One particularly strong point was the Carrier air-conditioning business, where operating profit more than doubled to an underlying $324m. It was one of the businesses that was early into the downturn in 2008 and is now rebounding, driven by demand from industrial customers.Eaton improved its pre-tax income by 79 per cent to $335m, on sales up 23 per cent to $3.8bn.This year the company’s US markets, which account for about 45 per cent of revenues, are growing faster than its non-US business, in particular because of a sharp recovery in the North American truck market.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said: “We are seeing a broad capital spending-based recovery coming out of the deep credit-driven recession of 2008-09 … And this is not just a story about a rebound in 2010-11; we are in a multiple-year expansion.”Eaton raised its earnings guidance to a midpoint of $3.81 per share for the full year, implying growth of 34-45 per cent from 2010.Honeywell, which makes parts for aircraft and vehicles as well as industrial equipment, reported a 40 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to 88 cents per share, and talked about a “particularly robust finish to the quarter.”Dave Cote, the company’s chief executive, added: “Orders in our short-cycle businesses have now increased eight consecutive quarters and our long-cycle backlog continues at near record levels. As a result of our strong first quarter and continued favourable outlook for our major markets, we’re raising our 2011 sales and EPS guidance.”The new earnings guidance is for earnings per share of $3.80-$3.95 for 2011, implying underlying growth of 27-32 per cent from 2010.United Technologies closed up 4 per cent at $85.90 and Eaton rose 2 per cent to $53.50. Honeywell’s results were announced after the market had closed, but the shares were up 2 per cent to $60 in after-hours trading."

Areas of expansion could include kitchenware, school equipment, toys and pet supplies. Ocado is expected to source most of the goods directly, although it could work with John Lewis on some products.Mr Belsham is the third director to leave Tesco this year, as it undergoes its biggest management transition in 14 years with the retirement of Sir Terry Leahy and appointment of Philip Clarke as chief executive. As well as Ms Wade-Gery, Lance Batchelor, who ran its telecoms business, was named chief executive designate of Domino’s Pizza UK & Ireland.Tesco said it would appoint a replacement for Mr Belsham in due course.…A small fry guyGervais Williams, one of the City’s best-known small-cap fund managers, has joined the executive committee of the Quoted Companies Alliance.Mr Williams caused consternation at Gartmore when he left in September after 17 years to “pursue other opportunities”, and has since resurfaced at the much smaller Aim-quoted MAM Funds.The QCA has been indefatigable in trying to persuade the Treasury to make life easier for smaller quoted companies and their investors, and is hoping for evidence in next week’s Budget that the government is serious about financing a private sector recovery.Mr Williams is a formidable addition to the team.…Great gunsIt is perhaps not a bad time for BAE Systems to add another American to its board. Paula Rosput Reynolds joins as non-executive director as the defence company negotiates with the US state department over a potential ban on the government granting it licences, following the company admitting conspiracy to defraud the country as part of an earlier settlement.Ms Reynolds runs a business advisory group, sits on the boards of Delta Air Lines and Anadarko Petroleum and, as chief restructuring officer at AIG, spent a year liaising closely with US authorities about an unpleasant business matter of another variety: AIG’s assets sell-off as it sought to pay back more than $85bn in government loans.Compatriots in the BAE boardroom include Linda Hudson, chief executive of BAE’s US subsidiary, and non-executives Paul Anderson and Carl Symon.…Fearful symmetryAnd finally: with Adam Balon, co-founder of smoothie maker Innocent Drinks, joining the advisory panel of Piper Private Equity, we note the transition of yet another entrepreneur (think Lovefilm’s Saul Klein, now a partner at Index Ventures, or Bernard Liautaud of Business Objects signing on at Balderton Capital) from innocence to experience.…Power Player: Fazel Fazelbhoy, CEO, Topaz EnergyFazel Fazelbhoy knows how to skewer a serious question, writes Christopher Thompson.Asked whether unrest in the Middle East will affect the Dubai-based oil services company he leads – and which is planning an initial public offering next month – he shakes his head. Why not? “Because we are offshore.” Literally floating in the Arabian Sea, he means, where Topaz operates some of its 100 oil services boats.Pakistan-born Mr Fazelbhoy is hoping to raise $500m (£310m) on the London Stock Exchange, which will help fund a $2.5bn expansion plan over the next three years in the Middle East, Brazil and western Africa. With shares priced at about 200p, the group would be valued at about $1.7bn, firmly in FTSE 250 territory.Topaz is one of a group of companies controlled by Renaissance Services, “a multinational holding company” listed on the Muscat stock exchange in Oman.Mr Fazelbhoy, who earned his business degree at New York University and worked for Honeywell in the US, has been based in the Middle East for more than a decade. He says if there is a common denominator to all governments there – regardless of religious or political persuasion – it’s the desire to “keep the oil flowing”. That should keep his boats safe.people@ft.com
153;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-03-17T21:50:47Z;Wall Street led by industrial gains;;Industrial and commodity stocks led a rebound on Wall Street following strong manufacturing data and a sense that the sharp sell-off in the previous session had been overdone.The S&P 500 bounced back 1.3 per cent to 1,273.72, paring some of the 2 per cent losses in the previous session, boosted by news that the Philadelphia Fed business activity index had showed its best monthly reading since January 1984.The index climbed 7.3 points in March to 43.4, far surpassing the 28.8 reading expected by economists.Also lifting sentiment was separate figures showing that weekly unemployment claims had declined by 16,000 to 385,000. “The downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data helped industrial stocks post some of the strongest gains in the session, recovering from some of the sharp losses earlier in the week. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, added 1.4 per cent to $19.22, paring back the 3.4 per cent losses seen in the previous session. The stock is down 5.6 per cent over the week, however.The S&P industrial index was up 1.6 per cent, reducing some of the 3.9 per cent losses suffered in the past five days. 3M was up 1.3 per cent to $88.69 while Honeywell was 1.6 per cent higher to $55.21 in the session.Elsewhere in the sector, FedEx saw gains after giving a strong fourth-quarter profit forecast. The package delivery company predicted a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share, topping the $1.66 estimated by analysts.This bright outlook overshadowed a reported 3.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profits and the shares were up 3.1 per cent to $87.89.Shares in rival UPS were up 1.8 per cent to $71.61 while Expeditors added 1.2 per cent to $47.11.Energy stocks saw the most powerful gains, however, as oil and gas prices jumped due to the turmoil in Japan and Bahrain.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was up 4.8 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips, the energy group, added 4 per cent to $76.72. The S&P energy sector jumped 3.1 per cent.Material stocks also saw strong gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.4 per cent to $52 as copper prices rose due to subsiding global panic. Cliff Natural Resources was up 5.8 per cent to $88.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4 per cent higher to 11,774.51 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,636.05 in the session.Still, strategists warned that this was not the end of the pullback in US equities and the market was still in a corrective phase. “The averages will probably work their way a bit lower in the coming weeks, but we are probably more than halfway through the corrections,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The S&P is still down 5.2 per cent since its mid-February high before the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa. The index is down 2.3 per cent over the week, but still up 1.3 per cent since the start of the year. The previous session saw the index fall into negative territory for the year for the first time.The Vix index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 10.4 per cent in the session. It is up 30.8 per cent over the week and 60 per cent above mid-February lows. Elsewhere, technology stocks saw gains, rebounding from a week of sharp losses.Qualcomm, which lost 4.7 per cent in the previous session, was up 3.6 per cent to $52.32 after the mobile-phone chipmaker said it sees limited impact from the Japanese disaster.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Apple was up 1.4 per cent to $334.64 while Hewlett-Packard gained 3.2 per cent to $41.40. The S&P technology index was up 1 per cent, paring some of the 2.7 per cent fall previously in the week.In corporate news Winnebago Industries, the motor home manufacturer, reported a surprising 3.6 per cent decline in second- quarter revenue, sending the stock down 12 per cent to $13.37. The company blamed weakening consumer confidence caused by volatility in gas prices for the fall. Elsewhere Guess, the clothing retailer, gave a weak outlook both for earnings this year and for the current quarter’s results. The company also reported lower comparable sales at its larger US retail business declined. Shares were down 14 per cent to $37.71.
154;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-03-16T21:34:12Z;Wall Street hit by overseas tensions;;Concern over the burgeoning nuclear crisis in Japan and heightened tensions in Bahrain led Wall Street lower for its third consecutive session, with technology and industrial stocks suffering from the sharpest losses.The markets began the day without much direction, but news that Günther Oettinger, the European Union energy chief, had said that the nuclear situation in Japan was “effectively out of control” and that there could be “catastrophic events within hours” led the S&P 500 to tumble over 1.6 per cent within minutes before lunch on Wall Street.These fears left the S&P index down 2 per cent to 1,256.88 at the close, adding to the 1.1 per cent fall on Tuesday and bringing the total losses for the week so far to 3.6 per cent. The index is on track for the heaviest weekly decline in seven months.The S&P 500 index has fallen 6.4 per cent since its mid-February highs, with the feared effects of the Japanese disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies from the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.The benchmark index is down 0.1 per cent this year, the first time it has strayed into negative territory.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, jumped up 19.4 per cent to an eight-month high on the comments by the EU energy chief.The Vix index is now up 77.1 per cent from its mid-February lows before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East.IBM and Apple saw some of the sharpest losses in the session due to supply worries following the earthquake in Japan and analysts downgrades on both stocks.Analysts at Citigroup said that one of the biggest risks to hardware companies such as IBM and Apple was supply constraints following the disaster in Japan. These constraints, it said, “could be meaningfully disruptive during the next couple of quarters”.“Apple could be the most challenged out of all the companies in our hardware universe,” said the note. “Apple derives roughly 8 per cent of the total operating income from Japan, but more importantly, the already tight supply of iPhones and iPads could get much worse.”Apple was down 4.5 per cent to $330.01, also weighed down by news that JMP Securities had lowered its rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. IBM fell 3.8 per cent to $153, also suffering from a downgrade.Elsewhere in the sector Qualcomm, a leading mobile phone chipmaker, was down 4.7 per cent to $50.50 while SanDisk, which makes flash memory cards, lost 3.7 per cent to $42.09.The S&P information technology sector fell 2.7 per cent.Many strategists were still saying that the recent losses could present a buying opportunity. Robert Sluymer at RBC Capital Markets said the current pullback will continue to “present timely long-side entry points on a wide range of names over the coming days and weeks.”Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said that this was a good time to buy depressed stocks, but also to hedge against risk due to the upturn in volatility.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2 per cent to 11,613.30 with all 30 components losing ground, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.9 per cent lower to 2,616.82.Looking at industrial stocks, General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, was down 3.4 per cent to $18.95 adding to the 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.Elsewhere 3M was 2.2 per cent lower to $87.55 while Honeywell declined 2.2 per cent to $54.33. The S&P industrial sector dropped by 2 per cent.Housing stocks lost ground after data showing that home construction had tumbled in February to its lowest level in nearly two years.The number of housing starts fell 22.5 per cent from the previous month to 479,000 in a further indication of weakness in the US housing market.Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, was down 2.2 per cent to $20.41 while Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilder, fell 2.9 per cent to $19.12.“While February’s result may overstate the case somewhat, the underlying trend of single-family housing starts shows no signs of improving in a significant manner anytime soon,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Coal mining stocks were some of the few to see gains in the session on hopes that a backlash against nuclear energy would spur on demand for coal.Peabody Energy was up 3.9 per cent to $67.67 while Consol Energy added 1.7 per cent to $52.38.
155;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-03-14T21:10:38Z;Renewables stocks benefit from fallout fears;;Uranium producers lost ground on fears that a nuclear crisis in Japan may reduce demand for the fuel worldwide, while the broader market tumbled as traders worried about the economic impact of the disaster.Shares in Uranium Energy lost 19.8 per cent to $3.89 following three separate explosions at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and mounting fears that there could be a full-scale nuclear disaster.Uranium Resources was down 24.7 per cent to $1.75 and Denison Mines fell 21.9 per cent to $2.57.Looking to capitalise on a potential backlash against nuclear power, however, some traders poured money into renewable energy stocks. MEMC Electronic Materials saw the biggest gain on the S&P index, rising 11.2 per cent to $13.37, while Suntech Power was up 3 per cent to $8.28.General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, saw its shares fall 2.2 per cent to $19.92.That contributed to shares in industry – one of the worst performing of the S&P sectors – losing 0.8 per cent. 3M fell 0.6 per cent to $91.02 and Honeywell 0.5 per cent to $56.01.Insurers also lost ground in the session. Aspen Insurance Holdings, which has exposure to Japanese quakes, fell 2.7 per cent to $26.85. Platinum Underwriters fell 3 per cent to $36.68. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 1,296.39 as traders fled from the uncertainty caused by Japan.News that Bank of Japan was doubling the size of its planned asset purchase programme to combat the economic effects of the disaster appeared to do little to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 index has fallen 3.5 per cent in the last three weeks, with the feared effects of the disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the marketplace, jumped 4.5 per cent on Monday. It is up 27.5 per cent since the unrest in Egypt and Libya began to unnerve traders in mid-February.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent to 11,993.16 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,700.97. Traders and analysts struggled to understand the potential impact of the disaster.Analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management suggested that it might be useful to compare it with the Kobe earthquake in 1995, which caused a 0.3 per cent to 1.3 per cent fall in Japan’s gross domestic product. However, they also point out that the Kobe region accounted for a much higher proportion of Japan’s GDP at the time than Sendai does.Many strategists argued that the disaster would have little long-term effect on US equity markets and some were using the drop in prices as an opportunity to add to their positions.“The initial sharp reverses [in the markets] have every chance of being reversed in the next few months,” said David Buik, senior strategist at BGC Partners. Unlike the area of the Kobe earthquake, he continued, “the Sendai region is, apart from the city itself, basically rural”.Mickey Cargile, managing partner at WNB Private Client Services said: “There is a short-term news effect …but I believe that this will not have a long-term impact on the markets.” Mr Cargile added that WNB was taking the opportunity to buy equities at depressed prices in anticipation of long-term growth.In deal news Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment group, agreed to buy Lubrizol, a producer of lubricant additives, for about $9bn in cash. Berkshire said it would pay $135 a share in cash, 28 per cent more than Lubrizol’s closing price on FridayThis sent shares in Lubrizol up 27.7 per cent to $134.68, an all-time high, while Berkshire was down 1.3 per cent to $84.21.The news comes just weeks after Mr Buffett told shareholders in Berkshire Hathaway that his “elephant gun” was ready for big acquisitions.Stock in Lawson Software rose to a three-year high following its announcement late on Friday that it had received a takeover bid from Infor and Golden Gate Capital, a private equity company. The shares were up 6 per cent to $12.24, which was ahead of the $11.25 per share in cash offered by Infor and Golden Gate, suggesting that investors were hoping that the bid price would increase.Walt Disney was down 1.6 per cent to $42.24 on news that its two amusement parks in Japan closed for 10 days following the earthquake.

Porsche lost 2.2 per cent to €56.19.Fears of rising inventories and a weaker-than-forecast outlook from Texas Instruments left the region’s chipmakers sharply lower.STMicroelectronics fell 3.8 per cent to €9.12 while Infineon shed 3.6 per cent to €7.21.
157;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-02-07T21:47:22Z;Bosses blinded by their bonus obsession;;"The interests of the corporation and its stockholders are best served by making key employees partners in the corporation’s prosperity …Each individual should be rewarded in proportion to his contribution to the profit of his own division and of the corporation as a whole.
Alfred P. Sloan
My Years With General MotorsSimple. Yet in spite of the logic of Sloan’s prescription and nearly a century of experience since the GM bonus plan was adopted in 1918, companies are no closer to getting executive pay right. In fact, with each tweak of a pay package or recalibration of the “rules”, they edge further from the goal.Such is the paucity of original ideas – in inverse proportion to the surfeit of people paid to think them up – that the best some experts can offer is that to reach a perfect alignment of pay, performance and corporate and community interest, you wouldn’t start from here.The problem with bonuses is that corporate paymasters think they are more important to staff than the staff themselves do. Recent research by PwC, the professional services firm, and the London School of Economics suggests the value that executives attach to incentives dwindles the longer payments are deferred, the more ambiguous or complex the plan, and the less control they have over how to meet targets. If employees think rewards are allocated arbitrarily or unfairly, bonuses undermine their motivation.In finance – where bonuses are valued to an obsessive degree – the risk that they will distort behaviour is even greater. “If you frame [your environment] in terms of money, you think only money matters,” says David De Cremer, professor of behavioural business ethics at Rotterdam School of Management. Instead of focusing on doing the job well, bankers focus on the reward for doing it. At best, bank employees jump through hoops to impress their bosses in bonus season. At worst, they behave unethically to polish performance and hit targets.But where the worst financial crisis since the 1930s has failed to change this culture, it is hard to imagine mere pay reform will succeed. Amending the rules may make things worse. That was the case in the 1990s, after the US Congress capped at $1m the part of an executive’s salary on which a company could claim tax deductions, prompting an explosion of stock option use – and abuse. It will be the case again with new rules to defer bank bonuses and claw back rewards for deals that later go bad.Unfortunately, the alternatives sound utopian. The intrinsic motivation of many bankers is the cut and thrust of the deal or the excitement of the big trade. Prof De Cremer hopes they can be made to seek motivation in the underlying value of their profession and their duty to society. A worthy goal – but one that will take generations to achieve, if it is possible at all.Instead, managers should set aside their blueprints and their Black-Scholes option calculators and return to first principles.The quest for the ideal incentive package is, as behavioural scientists’ increasing interest suggests, a human problem more than a mathematical one. Finding an answer takes time.David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, the US industrial group, with 122,000 global employees, reviews the performance of his top 200 people at least three times a year.Tailoring incentives in the right way also requires flexibility. Mr Cote’s basic notion that pay is about “fairness, not formulae” is as good a starting point as any. Of course, where money is involved, one person’s fair outcome is another’s travesty, as the gulf between Barclays and the rest of the world’s view of Bob Diamond’s pay package shows. That means progress will be made only by trial and error. If poorly supervised or insufficiently transparent, bonuses will be open to abuse. Even Sloan had to ask GM directors to adjust its incentive plan after the Depression gutted bonuses, a move that would put modern governance police on high alert.But these are not reasons to ditch incentive pay altogether, as long as managers recognise its limitations. Bonuses play their part in motivating staff on specific tasks or in certain areas, such as sales. But most employees are driven by a mix of goodwill, inner motivation and survival instinct.If employers stopped obsessing about bonuses as a silver bullet to improve performance, they might be amazed to discover how much could be achieved by encouraging staff with a fair salary, regular feedback and just treatment.andrew.hill@ft.com"

The latter stock was also helped by Citigroup raising its price target to £20.11.“Xstrata has a competitive advantage by targeting assets the other majors are reluctant to go after,” Citi said. “This should allow it to continue to grow at higher rates than its peers.”Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo American was up 2.3 per cent to £31.11 after earnings from its Anglo Platinum subsidiary reassured. Randgold Resources rose 2.6 per cent to £51.10 as mixed fourth-quarter results brought the group’s difficult year to a close.Miners added 17 points to the FTSE 100, which closed up 26.79 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 6,051.03. That left the index 5 points away from a 2½-year closing high reached last month.Arm Holdings led the blue-chip risers, up 3.9 per cent to 611p in spite of directors’ share sales.Numis Securities set a 660p share price target, based on the chip designer levering off its dominant market share to raise royalty rates.Taking two-thirds of the processor market by 2020 would give Arm earnings per share of 90p, justifying a valuation as high as £10, Numis said.Cairn Energy rallied by 2.1 per cent to 435½p after saying it still expected to complete the $9.6bn sale of its Indian unit by April 15.Cairn and Vedanta Resources, up 1.9 per cent to £24.32, have held talks with India’s oil ministry to resolve a dispute about royalties that threatens to derail the deal.Engineering conglomerate Smiths Group edged up 1.8 per cent to £13.74 amid renewed takeover speculation. Sterling’s weakness and the recent break-up approach from private equity was likely to have encouraged a US rival such as Honeywell to consider a move, traders said.Inmarsat was among the underperformers, with the shares slipping 0.3 per cent to 688p. After the close of trade, the satellite operator’s largest shareholder, Harbinger Capital, was selling its remaining 14 per cent stake.An upgrade to “add” from Numis helped lift Logica, the IT services group, by 4.4 per cent to 144p. Market conditions have continued to improve, which provides a trading opportunity ahead of Logica’s results later this month, Numis argued.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we’re on the comeback trail.”Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, is raising its capital spending budget from $1.7bn in 2010 to $3bn this year. More than half of the budget will be spent in the US to build capacity, going towards projects such as an excavator factory in Texas and a motor-grader facility in Arkansas.“If you look at our 2011 outlook, it’s still with the US, Europe and Japan well off historical peaks,” Ed Rapp, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, told the FT. “So, in this cycle, we have tried to get ahead of some of that, to put the investment in place now. That way when we get a more robust recovery in the developed world, we’ll be ready.”Eaton, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components, has said it expected its US sales to grow faster than its international sales this year. Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, told the FT that demand was “far stronger than people had thought it would be”.The Institute of Supply Management survey released last week pointed to the fastest rate of growth for manufacturing industry since 2004.Barry Knapp, strategist at Barclays Capital, said two factors contributed to the upturn in confidence since last summer: the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying programme and signs of a more business-friendly approach from Congress."
160;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-01-20T22:17:22Z;GE sets its sights high in Chinese tie-up;;General Electric’s avionics joint venture with Aviation Industry Corp of China (Avic), which is expected to be formally confirmed on Friday, has attracted a great deal of attention focusing on familiar concerns about protection of western companies’ intellectual property when doing business in China.The fear is that, as has happened in other industries, less sophisticated Chinese companies will take advantage of the collaboration to learn what they need, and then launch into the market as competitors with much cheaper versions of the same products.In the case of the new avionics joint venture, those concerns completely miss the point, says Jeff Immelt, GE’s chairman and chief executive.It is not a case of a world-beating western company being induced to surrender its technological leadership “under threat of death”, he says, adding that the relatively weak US business is seeking to use a Chinese alliance to propel it into the front rank of global competition.“This is a story about a joint venture: the Chinese bring technology, GE brings technology. It makes us better able to compete with Thales, BAE, Honeywell and Rockwell,” he says.GE does have a significant presence in avionics, however, not least as the supplier of the central system for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. But it is not one of the sector leaders and comes in at “number four or three, I think: not where we want to be,” Mr Immelt says.GE entered the avionics business in 2007, with the $4.8bn acquisition of Smiths Aerospace.GE’s calculation is that it can use its position on the Chinese C919 airliner, which is being built as a challenger to the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in the narrow-body market by Comac, to grow its global market share. The joint venture with Avic is supplying the C919 with GE’s flight management system – the central electronics system of the aircraft.Comac expects to sell more than 2,300 C919s over the 20-year life of the programme, creating a market for avionics systems worth about $2bn. The venture will also be able to bid for other programmes, in China and worldwide. Mr Immelt draws a parallel with CFM, GE’s 50/50 aero engine joint venture with Snecma of France, part of Safran, in which the French state has a 30 per cent stake.“It’s now the most successful joint venture, certainly in GE, maybe in the history of the world,” he says. “This is about creating a new competitor and it’s about an American company looking for strategic opportunity to develop a new platform.”He says of GE’s avionics operation: “It’s a good business today, but this gives us a chance to do integrated cockpits. And we’ll have more content on the C919 than on any other plane in history. This is more about trying to play offence in a win-win setting than: ‘under threat of death we gave our technology’ …It’s just not true.”GE has put in place various mechanisms to protect its IP, including a bar on Chinese staff with links to the military having access to technical data from GE or the JV. There is also a “cooling off” period to stop Avic staff moving to a Chinese military job within two years of leaving the JV.Mr Immelt accepts that protection of IP is a real issue. “When I talk to some of my friends in high-tech companies, they have legitimate concerns. I have a lot of empathy for those guys,” he says. He says every company setting up a joint venture “has to be very judicious about where they take their IP anywhere, and how they protect it”.

Mr Obama stressed that China offered enormous opportunities for the US, saying: “We want to sell you planes, we want to sell you cars, we want to sell you software.”Mr Obama said China’s success was “a tribute to the Chinese people” but also thanks “to decades of stability in Asia made possible by America’s forward presence in the region” and a global trading system championed by the US.Mr Hu’s arrival in Washington coincides with a low in bilateral relations, with the two sides squaring off over diplomatic, economic and business issues.Appearing at his first extended press conference in the west, Mr Hu insisted Beijing wanted to work closely with the US on global issues but said that ties should be based on “mutual respect”.“China is always committed to the promotion and protection of human rights,” he said.The pair, along with cabinet-level officials, held three hours of face-to-face talks following a welcoming ceremony. They interrupted their talks to sit together with business leaders from both countries to discuss commercial ties.Jeff Immelt, chief executive of GE, the largest US industrial group, said Mr Hu had promised that US companies that were “considered to be part of the fabric” in China would be able to bid for government contracts.He added: “We’re not looking for a handout; we just want to be able to compete toe-to-toe with everybody else.”Mr Obama said he wanted to move past the relationship’s “old stereotypes” according to which China only exported cheap goods to the US, stealing jobs along the way by keeping wages low. “The relationship is much more complex than that,” Mr Obama said.Tensions were evident elsewhere, with three congressional leaders declining to attend the state dinner at the White House on Wednesday evening. In a television interview, Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, called Mr Hu a “dictator”.China also said it would include provincial and local administrations along with the central government in a revised offer it will make this year to join the global regime for government procurement. Central government procurement alone is worth $88bn, Beijing says.The White House said that China had agreed to allocate government funding to buy legal software and strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property rights on the internet and in libraries.Additional reporting by Daniel Dombey"
162;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2011-01-19T18:16:16Z;Export orders worth $45bn signed;;"US and Chinese officials touted a $45bn package of export deals on Wednesday to coincide with the state visit of Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, but the largest contract was in fact a reiteration of a previously announced order.US companies have been critical of China in the past 12 months, pressing the administration of Barack Obama to toughen defence of their intellectual property rights and their ability to access lucrative Chinese government procurement contracts.To smooth the waters, the Chinese president met the chief executives of high-
profile US companies on Wednesday such as Jeff Immelt of General Electric, Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs.The export package includes a $19bn order for Boeing aircraft, 70 extra contracts involving 12 US states worth $25bn and a series of investment deals. Combined, the deals will support about 235,000 US jobs, the White House said.Still, in spite of the large headline numbers many of the deals represent already announced contracts or memorandums of understanding that forecast, rather than guarantee, potential revenues and jobs.The eye-catching Boeing deal ratifies aircraft sales agreed between 2007 and 2010 to several of the country’s largest airlines, including Air China, China Southern and Xiamen Airlines.But the deals do have some significance as a political gesture. The aircraft deal, for example, underlines the importance of China to US manufacturers such as Boeing, which estimates the Chinese market will require 4,330 new aircraft worth more than $480bn over 20 years.●A Chinese trade delegation will sign a deal on Thursday in Chicago to buy an unspecified amount of US soyabeans, according to the US Soybean Export Council.The companies participating in the signing are China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp, Sinograin Oils, Jilin Grain Group, Bunge Ltd, Chinatex Grains and Oils and the Yihai Kerry Group, the council, a producer-funded marketing group, said."

The German 10-year Bund yield held steady at 3.03 per cent.Meanwhile, support for the dollar came from still-elevated levels of US government bond yields.Treasuries initially attracted some buying following a rise in the 10-year yield to 3.5 per cent in the wake of Tuesday’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. But the yield began rising after the stronger US data were out, jumped 5 basis points to above 3.50 per cent for the first time since May.Analysts questioned the Fed’s decision to make only a modest upgrade to its economic outlook, in spite of last week’s tax compromise and recently improved US macro data.Indeed, Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, questioned whether the Fed was actually looking at the same data that others in the markets were focusing on.“The silence surrounding the Fed’s Tuesday statement spoke volumes, with the market begging to disagree with the central bank’s outdated assessment of the health of the economy,” said Mr Wilkinson.“The Fed has been singing from the same hymn book for so long that perhaps it deserves a chant from the market in the shape of rising 10-year yields – the ultimate arbiter of growth.”There was further good news on the US data front on Wednesday as the latest Empire State survey of manufacturing activity in the New York region came in much stronger than expected and US industrial production rose more than forecast in November.Meanwhile, subdued US consumer price data appeared to reinforce the Federal Reserve’s view that inflation was not yet a concern while deflation and disinflation remained more pressing.The figures offered some support to US equities, but the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent by the end of the session, dropping lower as Treasury yields rose and the dollar strengthened.The mood on Wall Street was not helped by a 2011 profit forecast from Honeywell that fell short of some analysts’ expectations.The Vix equity volatility index, watched as a measure of broad risk aversion, rose slightly, but was still holding below 18.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index snapped a seven-session run of gains – its longest winning streak in six months. The benchmark fell 0.5 per cent, but ended off the day’s lowest level.Asia suffered a broadly negative day, with the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo slipping less than 0.1 per cent, however the Hong Kong Hang Seng index slid 2 per cent.In commodities, copper eased back sharply from Tuesday’s record high and gold fell to just above $1,380 an ounce as prices responded to the firmer tone of the dollar.Crude oil found support, however, after US inventories fell by the most in six years. US crude was at $88.62 a barrel, up slightly on the session.

The middle of the range that the company forecast, between $3.50 to $3.70 per share, is below the average analyst estimate. It also forecast that sales would rise 6-9 per cent in 2011, which was at the lower end of analyst projections.General Electric also fell, even though it said it would finish the year with $20bn in cash on hand, and in the next few years could have $30bn to spend on take-overs, share buy-backs and dividend rises. The shares lost 1.1 per cent to $17.49.But elsewhere in industrials, Joy Global jumped 6.9 per cent to $85.78 after the maker of mining equipment forecast earnings in 2011 of between $5 and $5.30 per share, above the consensus estimate of $4.86.Caterpillar rose 1.1 per cent to $93.12 after analysts at RBC Capital Markets raised their price target for the stock from $98 to $108, saying it was poised to benefit from a rebound in spending and that its focus on mining machines would help marginsThe wider indices dipped late in the day to close lower after the dollar strengthened on the back of the positive economic data and the resurfacing of fears about eurozone debt. Stocks and the dollar have recently been moving in opposite directions.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,235.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.2 per cent to close at 11,457.47 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4 per cent lower at 2,617.22.US-listed shares in BP dropped 1.3 per cent to $43.86 after the White House sued units of the company as well as four other companies, alleging they violated environmental laws in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Boston Beer jumped 12.1 per cent to $94.97 after the brewer forecast earnings for 2010 of at least $3.30 a share, above the average analyst estimate. It also forecast strong earnings for its fiscal year 2011.

Community Health Systems offered to buy Tenet for $3.3bn, or $6 per share in cash and stock.But Tenet rejected the bid, at about a 40 per cent premium over Thursday’s closing price, as “not remotely fair value”.Shares in Community Health Systems, which has made eight acquisitions in the past two years, making it the largest publicly traded US hospital company, also soared, up 13.4 per cent to $35.89.Other healthcare stocks were lifted by the bid. Carefusion added 2 per cent to $24.19 Thermo Fisher rose 1.9 per cent to $53.04 and Boston Scientific gained 3.5 per cent to $7.11.Positive US economic data helped the wider indices edge up but they struggled to get past their two-year high.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,240.26, and higher by 1.2 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,410.32, up 0.1 per cent over the five days.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,637.54, climbing 1.8 per cent on the week.The US trade deficit contracted more than forecast in October as a weaker dollar and growing overseas economies helped exports hit a two-year high.A separate release showed US consumer sentiment increased more than forecast, to its highest level in six months. But it did not significantly move the consumer discretionary index, which was up just 0.3 per cent.Record commodities imports in China lifted shares in metal producers. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold added 2 per cent to $112.87 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources gained 3.3 per cent to $74.33.Industrials led the risers, climbing 1 per cent as both General Electric and Honeywell joined the ranks of companies returning more money to shareholders.General Electric jumped 3.4 per cent to $17.72 after it raised its dividend for the second time this year, making a total increase of 37 per cent this year. Honeywell added 1.3 per cent to $51.98 after it hiked its dividend by 10 per cent.United Technologies also rose, up 1 per cent to $78.40, after it said late on Thursday that it expected profit to rise between 7 and 14 per cent next year.The S&P 500 financials index climbed 3.6 per cent over the week with regional bank stocks surging 7.4 per cent.Analysts at JPMorgan said the rally in regional bank stocks had been sparked by the steepening of the yield curve in US Treasuries. “In our view, this response in valuations is justified given that a steeper yield curve should support net interest income growth as cash and securities are potentially invested at higher rates,” they said. “The steeper curve also points to [a] growing probability of rising short-term rates, which is a potentially powerful catalyst for core-deposit-funded institutions.”This week also saw the best first day of trading for an IPO in three years. Chinese video streaming company Youku soared 146.5 per cent when it debuted on Wednesday but dropped 12.2 per cent to $37.50 on Friday.Borders Group sunk 12.4 per cent to $1.20 after the bookstore chain said that, if talks to refinance failed, it could end up in violation of its credit agreements in the first quarter.Shares in the retailer had gained earlier in the week after Pershing Square Capital Management, William Ackman’s hedge fund, offered to finance a potential bid by Borders for rival Barnes & Noble. Shares in Barnes & Noble edged down 0.7 per cent to $15.08.

They have lost more than 6 per cent since a trading update on Thursday showed rising costs and weak wholesale banking revenues as clients turned more risk averse.“We see potential downside risk to consensus expectations for 2010 and 2011,” said Nomura. “While we believe that Standard Chartered remains well positioned for the long term, we are more cautious in the near term given the background of inflation and tightening in some of its key markets.”Merrill Lynch, which cut StanChart from its “buy” list, argued that the stock was already valued in line with Asian rivals at about 13.5 times 2011 earnings. “With expectations now full we think the shares need to take a breather to grow into the multiple,” it said.The wider market ended at a three-week high, with the FTSE 100 ending up 4.99, or 0.1 per cent, to 5,812.95. For the week the index was up 1.2 per cent.Mining stocks led the way after China raised its banks’ reserve requirement ratio for the sixth time this year. The move supported hopes that China will not raise interest rates at a meeting this weekend. Vedanta Resources was up 3.2 per cent to £22.75p and ENRC rose 2.9 per cent to 965p.Smith & Nephew gained 2.3 per cent to 650½p on continued talk of bid interest from the private equity consortium that bought US rival Biomet in 2007. S&N spiked higher earlier this week on talk of a bid approach of around 825p a share, though analysts have questioned whether such a deal could be funded given Biomet’s already stretched balance sheet.Engineering conglomerate Smiths Group took on 1.5 per cent to £12.55 on a revival of break-up speculation. Private equity was mentioned as a potential bidder, as was Honeywell.BAE Systems rose 1.8 per cent to 330½p, helped by “buy” advice from Execution Noble. The shares, down 19 per cent since October, are at a sharp discount to US peers in spite of recent beneficial moves in BAE’s pension discount rate and the possibility that its Platform Solutions disposal will close soon, Execution said.Cobham was supported by continued bid hopes, rising 2.9 per cent to 209½p. But Burberry, the subject of takeover speculation earlier in the week, lost 2.6 per cent to £11.08 after chief executive Angela Ahrendts gave shares worth about £136,000 to charity.Diageo gained 1 per cent to £11.74 on reports it was in early-stage talks to buy Turkey’s Mey Icki, the world’s leading maker of raki, from private equity for $2bn-$2.5bn.“The attraction for a global spirits company such as Diageo is the well established distribution network they would control in Turkey, with the ability to push their own brands through this and to develop further the existing local products,” said RBS.BG Group retraced recent gains, sliding 2.3 per cent to £13.03. The shares had been strong on Thursday after BG released new guidance on costs for its Tupi and Guará fields off Brazil. However, site operator Petrobras later reiterated its more conservative guidance and said BG’s update did not comply with the groups’ joint venture agreement.Among the mid-caps, Heritage Oil fell 1.6 per cent to 420½p after Petronas of Malaysia denied a report that it may make a bid for the Iraq-based oil explorer.Imagination Technologies dropped 4.9 per cent to 364p as Numis Securities speculated that the graphics chipmaker may have another acquisition lined up to announce with results due on Tuesday. Imagination’s last deal to buy HelloSoft, a maker of internet video technologies, sent shares lower by as much as 9 per cent amid concerns it was not a good fit.European Nickel slumped 25.4 per cent to 23¾p after the miner said it had placed its Caldag project in Turkey on care and maintenance. The prospect has been hampered by Turkey’s refusal to provide a forestry permit.“We believe that it is doing the right thing in focusing its efforts in the Philippines given the significant delays,” said house broker Evolution Securities, which kept a 55p valuation on the shares.Regal Petroleum responded to a gain in its share price by confirming that it was in late-stage talks over a bid valuing the Ukrainian explorer at 24p a share. The stock closed up 31 per cent at 24¼p.Exillon Energy, the Russian oil group, rose 12.8 per cent to 343p following its promotion to the FTSE 250 index, which will take effect later this month.Toledo Mining, the Philippines nickel miner, jumped 38.5 per cent to 32p after saying late on Thursday that it had received a preliminary takeover approach.

Members made a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets either by cutting emissions or by buying emissions permits sold by members.The business depended on the notion that the US would impose carbon emissions caps on companies and give its blessing to a market for trading credits, turning CCX’s voluntary trading into a mandatory market.However, Senate Democrats over the summer abandoned a push for cap-and-trade legislation. With Republicans expected to register big gains in Tuesday’s midterm elections, prospects for legislation look more remote than they have for several years.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said he remained bullish on emissions trading in Europe, where ECX is profitable. However, he signalled the death of the industry in the US, where cap-and-trade is a lossmaking business.“The voluntary market that was created has an expiration date of the end of this year in it,” Mr Sprecher said. “The bulk of the users have said to us that they really don’t want to continue to trade voluntarily in the absence of any credit for their work by the current administration.”He made the remarks as ICE reported third-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, although its projections for revenues from clearing credit default swaps came in below analysts’ forecasts.The company earned a net profit of $96m or $1.29 per share in the quarter, up from $87m or $1.18 per share in the same period a year ago.
169;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Overseas demand lifts US manufacturers;;The US economy may be faltering, but many big names in American manufacturing are going from strength to strength.In the past week, a succession of industrial companies, including Boeing, Honeywell, Caterpillar and Eaton, reported good third-quarter results and gave upbeat views on their prospects. Over the next two weeks, others, including Emerson Electric, 3M and Cummins are expected to show similar evidence of robust health.Yet in recent weeks, concerns over the strength of the recovery have been gathering force. Official data showed US industrial production fell in September, for the first time in more than a year. The discrepancy raises the question of whether US companies have been able to see sources of strength that macroeconomic data have missed, or have failed to appreciate the slowdown about to hit them.Honeywell, which makes industrial equipment and aircraft components, predicted on Friday that profits in its operating businesses would rise by 10 per cent or more next year.However, David Anderson, the chief financial officer, sounded a note of caution. “The markets we are in are generally in pretty good shape. But many of the macroeconomic indicators, particularly outside the industrial economy, are mixed to soft,” he said. “You have got to say, ‘How long will it continue?’ ”One reason for the disconnect is that markets outside the US are much stronger. The outperformance of the industrial sector this year compared with the broad S&P 500 index has reflected the health of overseas markets rather than that of the US economy.A common theme in all of last week’s good results was the strength of demand in China, other emerging Asian economies, the Middle East and Latin America.Most large industrial companies say they want to produce as much as possible in the markets they serve, but exports from the US are also rising, in a move towards the rebalancing of the world economy that is sought by many policymakers.About 25 per cent of US manufacturing output is exported, and David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, calculates that the dollar is about 10 per cent undervalued relative to its long-term average, giving US exporters an advantage. But the strength of exports may not be enough to sustain flagging growth.Eric Landry, who covers the industrial sector for Morningstar, the investment research company, warned: “Some of the forward-looking indicators can sometimes do better at predicting the outlook for companies than comments made by the companies themselves.”

Margins will be hit by increased spending on new warehouses and television advertising for its Kindle e-reader.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets were among several raising their price target for the retailer.“The key question facing investors is how long this investment cycle will last; we believe the heaviest spending will be behind Amazon by the first quarter of 2011 and [we can] expect operating margin expansion in the second quarter of 2011,” they said.They added that they expected the uncertainty on the investment cycle’s duration to create entry points for longer term investors.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,183.08 on Friday, higher by 0.4 per cent on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent at 11,132.56, gaining 0.5 per cent over the five days, and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,479.39 and rose 0.3 per cent over the week.“The S&P is really struggling to get over the 1,185 area,” said Nick Kalivas, equity analyst at MF Global. “The longer we sit here and don’t go higher, the more likely it is we’ll see a post-election and post-FOMC decision [on quantitative easing] sell-off.

171;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-10-19T11:36:19Z;Ups and downs in the state of business aviation;;"The latest Business Aviation Outlook from Honeywell Aerospace is a mixed bag. It pushes back the prospect of an upturn in the sector until 2012. But the 10-year forecast sees a 10 per cent rise in the value of total sales of new business jets, compared with the same forecast last year, to more than $225m.That reflects some substantial shifts in the market, including the growing trend favouring larger aircraft, and long-term trends in the second-hand market that have also influenced significant changes in the industry.Concerns over general economic conditions will keep deliveries of new jets to 675-700 this year, says Honeywell after surveying 1,200 corporate flight departments around the world for its latest outlook, published on October 17 in the run-up to the annual convention of the US National Business Aviation Association in Atlanta. Next year’s sales are also likely to be below 700.But while this is a far cry from the heady days of 2007 and 2008, when the annual rate of business jet deliveries exceeded 1,000, there is some positive news in the outlook.According to Rob Wilson, president of business and general aviation at Honeywell, while uncertainty over the pace of the economic recovery has knocked five-year purchase plans for new jets, especially additions to the fleet rather than replacements, the survey’s finding this year that respondents expect to buy aircraft equivalent to 30 per cent of their fleet is still among the top four annual scores since 1993.Also noteworthy is that sentiment on fleet replacement in North America inched ahead, rising by about a point. But in many other regions purchase expectations fell. In Europe, the figure fell to 34 per cent, but the region is still the second-largest customer for business jets, after North America.Expectations of buying new jets fell sharply in the Middle East and Africa as fears about the economy took their toll. Fleet expansions are still planned, but operators are trimming back plans to replace old jets. New large, long-range aircraft that are cheaper to operate than their predecessors are the target of particular interest.Asian purchase plans plunged from the year before, but remained high compared with other regions. And Latin America’s slight fall still left expectations of buying new jets at or above the levels seen in 2007 and before.Meanwhile, usage rates continue to climb around the world, especially among very light jets and ultra-long-range aircraft, with international flights recovering fastest in the US and in Europe. Some aircraft makers are reporting sales of spares above budget, reinforcing the picture of higher utilisation.“If you look at the US Federal Aviation Administration data on business aviation departures to overseas destination, that’s 40 per cent up year on year,” says Mr Wilson. “That indicates there’s a strong demand for doing business across regions of the world.”But fractional operations are still having a tough time. Only three jets were delivered to fractional operators in 2009 and the first half of 2010, says Honeywell, which also says sales of ownership shares have fallen further after 2009’s 52 per cent net slide.The market for used jets continues to struggle with high inventories, despite a fall to 15 per cent of the total global fleet from last year’s 17 per cent according to Mr Wilson. Honeywell’s survey recorded a fall by European and Latin American respondents in plans to buy second-hand jets – but a rise in all other regions.Earlier this month, JP Morgan’s business jet monthly report said the fall in inventories had slowed, although it forecast the decline was likely to resume.But Honeywell, and others, are also reaping a benefit from the older aircraft on the market. “In 2008, we made a conscious decision to invest heavily in upgrades and retrofits,” says Mr Wilson. “As recently as three years ago, for us this area was worth single-digit millions – today it’s in excess of $100m of revenue.”This week, Honeywell is announcing at the NBAA show a number of cockpit, engine and cabin upgrades to expand its business further in this area – and, of course, to allow customers to enhance the usability and resale value of older aircraft.One initiative is to cut by half the hours requirement for customers with some older engines to join maintenance service programmes, which should let them continue operating their aircraft with more certainty about upcoming costs.Pratt & Whitney Canada is announcing a similar scheme for operators of older PT6A turboprop engines.According to JetBrokers Europe, launched last year as an affiliate of the long-established JetBrokers of the US, buyers are returning to the market. But some sellers who are holding out for an improved offer are waiting too long – and, instead of driving the price higher, are seeing their sale collapse completely.Georgia on my mindHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, the international airport serving the host city of this year’s NBAA convention, is not unique in its ability to inflict extra delays.But the performance of waiting for checked baggage at the end of an international flight, waiting in an extremely long line for another opportunity to take off my shoes and put them through a scanner, then waiting still longer to claim the bag from the internal logic of an obviously confused system, is frustrating in the extreme; especially so as tailwinds had propelled us from London an hour ahead of schedule. Atlanta managed to remove that small gift of time – and then some.“We live here and it’s still ridiculous,” said another passenger, visibly wilting as she waited.It is a presumably unwitting, but nevertheless powerful, reminder of the advantages of private aviation. But then those who use private aircraft, such as the people climbing out of a Cessna jet under Signature Aviation’s huge, sun-shielding porch a day later, just up the road at DeKalb Peachtree airport, know that already.Cloud computingDassault Aviation is announcing this week that it has selected most of the partners for its planned super-midsize Falcon business jet, code-named SMS, and has already embarked on a design phase at its headquarters in Saint Cloud, Paris, for an intensive few months. But there is something deliciously ironic about the phase that will follow.In a development of the process pioneered on the somewhat larger 7X, the designers will then disperse again and work together in real time, from their different locations, on a single computer-generated, digital model. No need, then, for the frequent physical meetings that business jets are so good at making possible.The French aircraft maker will not be the only one in trouble if this way of working really takes off."
172;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-10-18T23:17:26Z;Hopes fade for early start to recovery;;"Shrinking revenues, more job cuts and gloomy forecasts. Such is the state of much of the business jet industry on the eve of one of the sector’s biggest annual gatherings.Two years on from the Lehman Brothers investment bank collapse that preceded the industry’s savage swing from boom to bust, any hope of a recovery next year looks misplaced.“Now it’s looking very much like 2011 will be more of the same and 2012 will be when things start picking up,” says Gary Crichlow, an analyst at the Ascend aviation consultancy in London who tracks business aviation trends.The industry has spent 2010 “convalescing”, says Richard Aboulafia, vice-president for analysis at the Teal Group consultancy in Virginia, who has long predicted there is unlikely to be a recovery until 2012.The reason is simple enough given the business’s sensitivity to a global economy that has continued to show weakness; fears of a double-dip recession and concerns about the impact of government austerity programmes and the availability of financing.The industry managed to deliver about 830 business jets last year, by Ascend’s count, slightly more by some others. This year, the consultancy has counted only 445 shipments in the first three quarters, suggesting it will struggle to reach even 600 over the full year.In the third quarter alone, there were only 125 deliveries, 39 per cent fewer than in the same quarter last year.This is all a long way from where the corporate aviation sector was only three years ago. On the back of record corporate profits and robust economic growth, business jet deliveries surged to more than 1,000 for the first time in 2007 and jumped again in 2008, thanks to huge backlogs prompted by mounting orders.But the gloomy forecasts for this year need putting into perspective, says Rob Wilson, president of business and general aviation at Honeywell Aerospace, recalling the industry was “very joyous” about delivering 600 or 700 jets a year as recently as 2004-05.This is true, but of little comfort to the people hit hardest in this downturn, such as the thousands of workers laid off by US aircraft manufacturer, Cessna. In September, it announced that a further 700 jobs would be cut, on top of the 8,000 it has shed since late 2008.Its total workforce has been cut in half, with most of the losses at its Wichita plant, where a workforce of 12,400 has been reduced to 6,200 and will only number around 5,500 in December, after the latest layoffs.Clearly it is going to be some time before the industry returns to its earlier peaks.There are some signs of improvement, though. Flight activity is edging up, as are sales of used aircraft. But both indicators are far from what they used to be.The proportion of the global business jet fleet up for sale has fallen from its record highs of 16 per cent, or more than 2,000 jets, in May 2009, says Mr Aboulafia.But it has failed to dip below 14 per cent since the start of 2010, indicating “a severe oversupply problem”.Honeywell’s latest annual business aviation outlook, published on Sunday, also suggests a recovery will not be seen until 2012, after disappointing rates of global economic recovery forestalled order rates and softened hopes of an uptick in 2011.It is predicting deliveries of 675-700 aircraft in 2010 and expects shipments to be below 700 next year.Longer term, Honeywell’s forecasts have changed little from last year’s prediction that 11,000 new jets worth $200bn would be delivered between 2009 and 2019.It still thinks 11,000 jets will be delivered between 2010 and 2020, but says they will be worth slightly more, at $225bn.Mr Wilson says the jump in value is partly due to price escalation and partly a result of a phenomenon that has become increasingly evident in this downturn – a shift in demand for larger business jets.Past recessions have not revealed such a trend, says Mr Aboulafia, adding: “We’re moving towards an industry that favours larger planes.”Historically, he says, the business jet market could be divided in half by value, with the top consisting of jets costing $25m or more (in 2010 dollars) and the bottom of those costing less than $25m.These halves have risen and fallen in tandem for most of the past 20 years. But in this downturn, deliveries in the bottom half plummeted in 2009 by a huge 42.8 per cent – the worst decline of any aerospace market in this recession.Yet deliveries at the top end stayed almost constant, falling by only 4.1 per cent by value.The split has been evident among leading manufacturers, with companies that focus on the top end, such as Dassault of France, doing better than those more reliant on smaller aircraft, such as Cessna.Mr Aboulafia says the most obvious explanation for this divide in the market is that sales of the cheaper aircraft are more dependent on small and midsized businesses that are more sensitive to an economic downturn.They are also more likely to be dependent on getting credit and since this downturn has been marked by a credit crunch, that may explain why they are hit harder than the top half customers.Another reason could lie in continuing woes of fractional jet operators who are big customers for bottom-half planes.According to Honeywell, deliveries of new jets to fractional fleet operators were down 80 per cent in 2009. Only three new jets were shipped to customers in this part of the market in the first half of 2010.Looking further forward, Honeywell, which bases its outlook on a survey of 1,200 corporate flight departments around the world, says purchase expectations in North America remain largely unchanged.But expectations in other parts of the world have softened, most noticeably in Europe and the Middle East, and to a lesser extent in Latin America and Asia.Asian purchase plans revealed an 18-point decline compared with last year’s survey, but remain high compared with other regions and historically, says Honeywell.“The slower recovery of major trading partner economies and some concerns regarding export-fuelled growth and Chinese real estate markets has increased the caution level operators displayed in the 2010 survey.”When all the regions are counted together, Honeywell says operators plan to replace 30 per cent of the global fleet over the next five years.That is still a relatively high figure, says Honeywell’s Mr Wilson.In addition, Honeywell says despite cancellations and deferrals, there are several thousand aircraft on order, many new models for delivery after 2011.“Assuming economic recovery progresses, it is still likely delivery of these aircraft will be taken, proving a boost to shipment levels as we move into the 2012-2013 period,” it says.So how would Mr Wilson sum up his views on the industry? “Guarded,” he said. “Cautious.”It is likely to be some time before that impression changes."
173;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-10-18T23:17:26Z;Africa: Regional market shows an upward trend;Rohit Jaggi notes more demand for private charter flights but says infrastructure is still patchy;The football world cup saw a spike in business jet use in Africa. But there are signs that, over and above those few busy weeks, private aviation across the continent is on a robust upward trend.Tag Aviation, the global group that has one of the largest fleets of “wide-body” jets that can serve Africa direct from Europe, has seen a 30 per cent increase in charter flights to and from the continent this year.“This is predominantly with corporate clients that need to travel to a number of destinations in a short time,” says Walter Stark, vice-president of charter services at Tag. “With the increase of economic activity in the region, it is expected that this trend will continue.”The group, which has bases in Hong Kong and across Europe including at Farnborough Airport, which it owns, is also looking at forming partnerships with airlines in Africa to provide services such as corporate shuttles, and is studying ways it can become involved in improving services – maintenance and airport operations for example.That could have wider benefits. Mark Wooller, head of corporate aviation and consultancy at the Independent Bureau of Aviation, an advisory group, says he is advising a potential charter operator in west Africa whose options on aircraft are severely limited by the local infrastructure. “A lot of the airfields are fairly short, and some are not fully surfaced,” he says.VistaJet, the Switzerland-based private aviation company, has seen particularly strong demand for flights between west Africa and Europe, and for travel between Nigeria, Congo, Ghana and Ivory Coast.Thomas Flohr, chairman, says VistaJet sees “major potential” in the region, “particularly among business leaders and entrepreneurs in the energy and government sectors who fly frequently within west Africa and between there and Europe.“We believe it has the potential to become one of VistaJet’s biggest markets.”The latest Business Aviation Outlook survey from aerospace company Honeywell, released this week, says Africa-based operators of aircraft are markedly less bullish about the likelihood of buying new business jets this year than they were in 2009. But, to put that into context, their plans for fleet expansion over the next five years are far ahead of North American levels, while aircraft replacement hopes have been hit by doubts about the sustainability of economic growth.Dassault, the French manufacturer of long-range Falcon business aircraft, says the South African market in particular has been “pretty active” over the past couple of years. It has also gained further government sales across Africa this year.Ashurst, the international law firm, has probably seen more business aircraft finance deals in Africa during the past year than any other big international firm, says Paul Jebely, its head of aviation for Asia, the Middle East and Africa.Deals advised on over the past 12-14 months have been for aircraft worth more than $400m. He says lenders are more likely to remain closely involved than in a wholly European deal, for example, in order to make sure that the value of the aircraft is being maintained.“Outside the regular concerns, what they are particularly concerned about are jurisdictional risks including political risks,” he says. “And as a tertiary consideration they concern themselves more with maintenance.”With the support infrastructure for business aircraft still patchy, Mr Jebely says there can be a marked difference in standards of paperwork-keeping between smaller aircraft that fly within the continent, and larger aircraft, such as the Boeing Business Jet, whose purchase he previously advised on – with the paperwork on bigger aircraft more likely to be in order.“Lenders care about this because it has a marked effect on re-marketability,” he says.The lawyer, who based himself in Hong Kong to be at the centre of Asia, points to a couple of significant African trends. “As high net worth individuals become ultra high net worth individuals, they are tending to upgrade,” says Mr Jebely, who was involved in the first purchase of a private Airbus A380 superjumbo. The majority of the deals he has done in Africa are for individuals, he adds.Another is that, despite the sharp competition between lenders, the private banks are looking for tight loan-to-value ratios – sometimes with a cap of just 50 per cent.But while European financiers do lend for African business aircraft, most of the lenders are Africa-based.Many aircraft are put on offshore registers – Bermuda and the Caymans, for example – and not just for the tax benefits. “A lot of deals will be structured so as to take advantage of regulatory oversight from a very competent aviation authority,” says Mr Jebely. “That’s usually driven by the financiers. And usually the borrowers are happy to go along with that.”Mr Jebely reckons that South Africa and Nigeria between them account for more than half the African business aircraft deals, although Angola is a fast-rising third. He reckons that the potential is huge.“I’m sitting in Asia, in the hottest aviation market in the world right now, and I’ve decided that the main focus of my practice for the next two years is going to be both Africa and Asia,” he says.“I’m certainly quite bullish about African business aviation.”
174;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Survey grounds business jet recovery hopes;;Hopes that the battered business jet market might start recovering next year have been dashed by the faltering global economy, says one of the world’s leading aerospace groups.US-based Honeywell Aerospace, which makes everything from engines to flight-control systems for corporate jets, has also detected weaknesses in recently strong markets in Asia in its latest Business Aviation Outlook, published on Sunday.The news is a further blow to one of the aviation sectors worst affected by the global economic downturn.Deliveries of jets have plunged since the industry rode the financial services boom to ship more than 1,000 jets for the first time in 2007 and even more in 2008. Some analysts believe that it will struggle to produce many more than 600 aircraft this year.Honeywell, which is predicting fewer than 700 deliveries this year and next, had said in the 2009 edition of its 10-year, forward-looking survey that it anticipated a modest recovery next year. “However, disappointing rates of global economic recovery have forestalled order rates and softened the 2011 outlook,” it says in its new survey.It believes a “rather robust” recovery is likely to start in 2012 and that the next peak in the cycle could be even higher than 2008, “although rather late in the forecast period”.The group, which surveys more than 1,000 corporate-flight departments worldwide for its annual outlooks, found signs of decline this year in Asia, where the purchasing plans of operators declined 18 points compared with last year.“The slower recovery of major trading partner economies and some concerns regarding export-fuelled growth and Chinese real-estate markets has increased the caution level,” it said. Purchasing expectations also softened in Latin America and retreated more noticeably in Europe and the Middle East. But they were up slightly in North America.Rob Wilson, president of business and general aviation at Honeywell Aerospace, said that the results in Asia had to be seen in context as they were still historically high and still strong compared with other regions.In addition, he said that it should be recalled that it was only six or so years ago that the industry was very pleased to be seeing annual delivery rates of 600 jets.Overall, Honeywell is forecasting that the industry will produce about 11,000 new business jets from 2010 to 2020, the same number it predicted last year.Others agree that the industry is unlikely to see a recovery in coming months.“There’s just so much volatility,” said Gary Crichlow of the Ascend aviation consultancy in London, which tracks business aviation market trends. “It isn’t as bad as 2008 or 2009. I think most of the pain has gone.” But short term, it was likely to remain uncertain.

Todd Hagerman at Collins Stewart said on average large US banks have 8.79 per cent tier one capital, which is more than the 7 per cent equity component that Basel III will require.Keith Horowitz, an

The broader industrials sector rose 1.1 per cent.Oil companies benefited from oil prices reaching a four-week high, partly due to the continuing closure of the largest oil pipeline from Canada to the Midwest of the US after a leak, and partly on the back of the Chinese economic data.ConocoPhillips rose 1.2 per cent to $55.38 and Suncor Energy was higher by 1.1 per cent to $33.26. ExxonMobil fell 0.3 per cent to $61.00 after its rating was cut from “buy” to “hold” by Deutsche Bank because of its exposure to natural gas, of which there is a surplus across the world.Xerox, the photocopy machine and document-management company, rose 7.7 per cent to $9.81 after it was reported that the share price could double as it enters the more profitable data processing, analysis and storage market."

Mr Hurd, who left HP last month after the company said he violated the standards of business conduct, will become a president and member of the Oracle board. Hewlett-Packard sued Mr Hurd, saying his appointment at Oracle puts HP’s confidential information “in peril”. HP shares fell 1 per cent to $39.92.In deal news, Casey’s General Stores advised shareholders to reject a new takeover offer from Alimentation Couche-Tard, saying that an unnamed third party had made a higher bid of $40 a share. The board had authorised discussions with the anonymous potential bidder but said the offer, which would price the convenience store chain at $2bn, still failed to reflect the stock’s value. Shares in Casey’s rose
9.9 per cent to $42.76 after it also reported its first-quarter results.Air Products and Chemicals fell 0.9 per cent to $77.38 after it lifted its offer for its rival Airgas by 3 per cent to $5.5bn, in the latest round of the hostile bid. Shares in Airgas also fell, down 1.4 per cent to $65.75.Res Care, the homecare provider, added 6 per cent to $13.20.

The FTSE 100 ended down 31.37, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,407.82.BHP Billiton fell 1.4 per cent to £18.92 and Rio Tinto was 1.8 per cent weaker at £34.47 after Australia’s Labor party won the right to form a minority government, putting higher taxes back on the agenda. Evolution Securities cut Rio to “neutral” in response.Banks slipped after a report in the German press suggested the Basel III capital requirements would be more onerous than predicted. Lloyds Banking Group fell 0.5 per cent to 72½p and Royal Bank of Scotland was 1.8 per cent weaker at 46p.Barclays faded 2.7 per cent to 314p after confirming that Bob Diamond will succeed John Varley as chief executive next year.Separately, Bernstein Research cut Barclays to “market perform” based on fears of a US double-dip recession and a second peak in loan losses.A Goldman Sachs downgrade to “neutral” sent Tui Travel lower by 1.5 per cent to 218¼p. Goldman said that, while it did not rule out a takeover offer from majority shareholder Tui, “our analysis suggests that such a bid is unlikely to be imminent”.With defensive stocks in favour, Severn Trent rose 2.4 per cent to £13.65 after Citigroup said it was the most likely among the water utilities to receive a takeover approach.Continued speculation of Chinese interest squeezed Tullow Oil higher by 3.9 per cent to £12.28, though analysts doubted a bid was possible while the group resolved a tax dispute with the Ugandan government.Among the mid-caps, Xchanging dropped 6.7 per cent to 126¾p after HSBC said profit growth may disappoint due to recent staff attrition. The broker cut its rating to “underweight” with a 105p target.De La Rue lost 3.2 per cent to 681p after the bank-note printer said staff had deliberately falsified test certificates. Legal fees, writeoffs and one-off costs would total at least £35m in the first half.Ocado was down 7 per cent to 146p after maiden results from the grocery delivery service proved uninspiring. “We do not come away particularly more enlightened, encouraged or enthusiastic,” said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black, who repeated “sell” advice.Tate & Lyle gained 2.8 per cent to 450¾p as JPMorgan Cazenove said a trading update due this month may provide a catalyst to recoup recent underperformance. “Recent evidence of firmer by-product prices improves the outlook for the rest of the calendar year,” it said.Engineer GKN lost 2.6 per cent to 147¾p after Société Générale cut the stock from its “buy” list on valuation grounds.Speciality drug company ProStrakan dropped 32.5 per cent to 53p on a triple dose of bad news. Not only did the company announce further delays to its two key products, Abstral, a treatment for cancer pain, and Sancuso, an anti-nausea patch, but also the departure of its chief executive with immediate effect.Piper Jaffray said the product delays meant ProStrakan may have trouble meeting its debt obligations. “This is the big issue,” said analyst Sam Fazeli. “In the absence of earnings, ProStrakan may have to do a financing – this could be very dilutive. The wild card is that the company sells its US operations and goes back to its grassroots of being a European speciality pharma company.”Solomon Gold jumped 27.9 per cent to 6¾p on optimism about an update expected soon from its gold and copper exploration prospects in the Solomon Islands.Sunkar Resources dipped 0.8 per cent to 29½p even though the Kazakh phosphates company struck a financing deal for its Chilisai fertiliser project in Kazakhstan.Kenmare Resources gained 5 per cent to 21p ahead of an index reshuffle on Wednesday at which the African mining company is expected to be added to the FTSE 250.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to close at 10,447.93, 2.9 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.5 per cent higher at 2,233.75, rising 3.7 per cent over the five days.All of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were up, adding to a two-day rally that began after positive manufacturing data were released on Wednesday.The August non-farm payroll report showed the number of people employed fell less than expected. Payrolls were down 54,000 even as temporary census jobs fell by 114,000. Economists had forecast a drop of almost double, at 105,000.Private employment, viewed as a better gauge of the health of the labour market, climbed 67,000. But the unemployment rate rose from 9.5 per cent last month to 9.6 per cent.Payrolls from June and July were revised to show that 123,000 fewer jobs were lost than previously reported.But shares came down slightly from their highs after a report showed non-manufacturing activity in the US grew more slowly than expected. The ISM index fell to 51.5, compared with forecasts of 53.5.Michael Yoshikami, president and chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors said the payrolls report also showed the service sector is still suffering.“I think the softness is obviously in the service sector and I think that really does suggest that as the US is so much of a service economy, we’re going to have a high unemployment rate for a long time,” he said. “The positive surprise is that things aren’t getting worse.”He added that a rise in temporary workers showed a structural shift in how companies were prepared to hire.Shares in providers of temporary employees rose, with Robert Half International climbing 4.5 per cent to $24.03 and Kelly Services increasing by 9 per cent to $12.46.Monster Worldwide, the online recruitment service, soared 7 per cent to $12.33 on the back of hopes more people will be using its website to successfully find jobs.Financials and industrials stocks rose on hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 financials index, the sector that suffered the most in August, climbed 2.2 per cent.Goldman Sachs soared 5.4 per cent to $147.29, Morgan Stanleyclimbed 3.8 per cent to $26.66 and JPMorgan Chase rose 2.7 per cent to $39.17.Industrials rose 1.4 per cent with Caterpillar adding 2.3 per cent to $70.08 and Honeywell gaining 1.9 per cent to $42.82.Technology stocks also advanced 1.7 per cent, with Cisco, which has made two acquisitions in the past week, putting on 2.5 per cent at $21.94.Google rose 1.5 per cent to $470.30 after it was reported that it intends to create a music download service that would compete with Apple’s iTunes software. Shares in Apple also gained, rising 2.6 per cent to $258.77.Meanwhile there were some bright spots for corporate outlooks. US Airways surged 3.3 per cent to $9.97 after the airline said its passenger revenue per seat mile increased by about 15 per cent.But earnings news was more mixed as Campbell Soup Co became the latest company to beat earnings expectations because of cost-cutting but miss revenue estimates. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $36.21.In contrast, H&R Block, the US tax arranger, reported a first quarter net loss from continuing operations of 36 cents per share which was less than the 41 cents which analysts had expected. Its shares surged 5.8 per cent to $13.30.
179;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-08-17T20:44:16Z;Wall Street rises on positive retail earnings;;US equities rose on Tuesday after retail bellwethers Walmart and Home Depot reported positive earnings, Potash, the fertiliser maker, rejected a takeover bid and data showed US production rose more than expected.The S&P 500 closed up 1.2 per cent at 1,092.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1 per cent to close at 10,405.85 and the Nasdaq closed 1.3 per cent higher at 2,209.44.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose, with seven rising more than 1 per cent.Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan said it had rejected a $39bn offer from BHP Billiton. Potash, the world’s largest fertiliser producer, described the proposal as “grossly inadequate”.“There’s nothing like a headline-grabbing takeover bid to get the “animal spirits” back up,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.“Its odd because it is an Australian company going after a Canadian company but …it is that kind of potential deal which drives home the fact that companies have cash, that there is value and that there’s going to be growth globally.”US-listed Potash shares soared 27.7 per cent to $143.17, with US-listed shares of BHP Billiton falling 2.4 per cent to $70.21.Data showing production in the US rose more than expected in July pushed up shares in the materials and industrials sectors. Production climbed 1 per cent – more than double the average forecast.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, up 2.3 per cent, with commodity stocks adding to Monday’s gains. Alcoa advanced 3.3 per cent to $10.95 and Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4 per cent to $62.87.The industrials sector was up 1.8 per cent with Honeywell rising 2.9 per cent to $42.39 and Caterpillar climbing 1.8 per cent to $69.74.But investors shrugged off weaker than expected housing data with the S&P 500 homebuilders index rising 2.6 per cent, after falling 1.1 per cent on Monday on the back of a report showing housebuilder confidence fell.The S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.8 per cent after bellwether chains reported better than expected results and raised profit forecasts.Walmart rose 1.2 per cent to $51.02 after it posted a better than expected quarterly profit of 97 cents a share for the second quarter. On average, analysts had forecast profit of 96 cents a share. The company also raised its forecast for the full year to $3.95 to $4.05 a share from a previous projection of $3.90 to $4 on the back of cost cuts and international growth.But the world’s largest retailer said sales at US stores open for more than a year fell and warned that the consumer remained cautious.Home Depot also beat analysts’ estimates but sales missed expectations. Second-quarter earnings per share were 72 cents compared with the consensus forecast of 71 cents but sales missed forecasts.In contrast to competitor Lowe’s which said on Monday that full-year profit would come in below some analysts’ expectations, Home Depot raised its profit forecast. It said cost-cutting would boost profits but the home improvement chain also cut its sales forecast. Shares rose 3.4 per cent to $28.31.Fashion chains Urban Outfitters and Abercrombie & Fitch joined the list of retailers beating expectations.Urban Outfitters, reporting after the closing bell on Monday, said sales jumped 20 per cent in the last quarter, 7 per cent at stores open at least a year. Less discounting boosted margins and second-quarter profit rose 46 per cent. Shares rose 5.1 per cent to $32.95.But preppy clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch fell 6.9 per cent to $35.05 in spite of reporting better than expected second-quarter profit as discounts damaged profits and concerns about a rise in inventories weighed on the shares.TJX, the owner of retail chains including TJMaxx, rose 1 per cent to $41.78 after reporting a rise in profit as customers continued to flock to buy its discount designer brands.Saks, luxury retail chain, rose 2.6 per cent to $7.81 after reporting a second-quarter loss that was narrower than analysts estimated.
180;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-08-10T16:30:48Z;Life is a Dream/Albert Herring, Santa Fe Opera, New Mexico;;Good things come to operas that wait, at least sometimes. Lewis Spratlan’s Life is a Dream, written in the late 1970s, went unperformed when its commissioning organisation folded. Two decades later Act Two was performed in concert, with the surprising result that it won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for music. Fast forward one more decade and Life is a Dream has its world premiere at America’s leading summertime opera venue, the Santa Fe Opera.In a programme note, Spratlan, an Amherst College professor, observes a bit sheepishly that in the 1970s “American classical music was mostly ‘serial’ music” – “very rigorous” and “mathematical”. And so it is with Life is a Dream. We may be grateful that composers moved on stylistically to something else, but that should not obscure the virtues of an opera such as this.James Maraniss’s strong libretto taps into a meaty source: Calderón’s 17th-century drama La Vida es Sueño, about a king, Basilio, who responds to bad omens attending the birth of his son Segismundo by exiling him to a tower in the wilderness. Though well educated by Basilio’s loyal vassal Clotaldo, Segismundo has a bestial side owing to his otherwise deprived upbringing. Allowed a trial visit to court – an experience he is encouraged to regard as a dream – Segismundo murders a servant and attempts to rape Clotaldo’s daughter Rosaura.Spratlan’s command of his musical resources is sure, and he is not above varying the score’s academic tone with music of a more emotional bent. This is particularly true for Rosaura (glowingly sung by Ellie Dehn), who, overlooking the prince’s indiscretion, comes to view him with sympathy. The tenor Roger Honeywell, in splendid voice as Segismundo, charts the course of a character who initially delivers a self-pitying rant yet ultimately proves fit to rule. John Cheek and James Maddalena give polished performances as Basilio and Clotaldo.The production, directed by Kevin Newbury, with strangely modernistic sets by David Korins and costumes redolent of Calderón’s era by Jessica Jahn, runs smoothly. Leonard Slatkin draws a cogent and precise performance from an orchestra accustomed to playing new music. Notwithstanding stretches in which Spratlan seems to be going through the atonal/serial motions, Life is a Dream emerges as an opera that works. ()Benjamin Britten proved that a composer could resist serial technique back then and still have a major career. Yet the musical rewards of Albert Herring, his only comedy, are modest. The opera tells of a timid teenage boy’s break from a domineering mother, but its chief delights, in Paul Curran’s scintillating staging, stem from Britten’s characterisation of the community pillars of a fictional Sussex town, above all Lady Billows (Christine Brewer), who keeps the vicar (Jonathan Michie), the police superintendent (Dale Travis) and the school headteacher (Celena Shafer) securely under her thumb. When this crew interacts, the result, thanks to Curran’s keen instinct for humour, is more like drawing-room comedy than conventional opera. Yet their first scene ends with a spirited fugal ensemble, the opera’s best piece.This is not to detract from Alek Shrader’s vibrant, handsomely sung performance in the title role or the sterling contributions from Kate Lindsay and Joshua Hopkins as Nancy and Sid, the couple that show Albert the way towards liberation. Kevin Knight’s decor represents Lady Billows’s parlour and the grocery store of Mrs Herring in exquisite detail. Albert Herring will never be required listening but, with Sir Andrew Davis conducting, I don’t soon, if ever, expect to see it better executed. () www.santafeopera.org
181;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-08-04T16:59:42Z;US carbon emissions trading in doubt;;The future of carbon emissions trading in the US is in doubt because of the lack of cap-and-trade legislation, Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, said on Wednesday.The US has a voluntary nationwide cap-and-trade market organised by the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Its parent, UK-listed Climate Exchange (CLE), was bought by ICE last month for £395m ($627m). CLE also operates Europe’s main carbon emissions trading platformsAlthough CCX’s market is voluntary, since launching in 2003 it has attracted large US companies such as Ford, DuPont, Bank of America, Cargill, Monsanto, Honeywell, IBM, Motorola and Intel. Members make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets either by cutting emissions or by buying emissions permits sold by members who have reduced emissions below target.In spite of luring big companies and possessing significant political clout, the receding prospect of the US passing cap-and-trade legislation has drawn into question the whole idea of carbon trading as a viable business.Mr Sprecher, whose move for CLE was a big bet on the future of carbon trading, questioned the future of the business on Wednesday. “These companies have voluntarily agreed to cap and walk-down their carbon footprint,” he said of CCX’s members.“It remains to be seen now in an uncertain US regulatory environment whether companies are going to want to continue to walk-down their carbon footprints, whether or not they’re going to get credit for it . . . and how the Environmental Protection Agency oversees carbon and whether the EPA will give them credit for the work they’re voluntarily doing. That’s one question we have to ask the marketplace.”In the absence of new legislation, the EPA could implement a carbon regime based on the Clean Air Act that would set emissions limits but may not allow for carbon trading – raising the prospect of “cap, but not trade”, he said.Mr Sprecher made his comments as ICE reported second-quarter earnings and revenues above Wall Street’s expectations as trading surged in energy and commodities, economic uncertainty drove up financial hedging and the company benefited from cost-cutting.The company earned $102m, or $1.51 per share, excluding extraordinary items, up from $72m, or $1.13 per share, in the same period a year earlier and ahead of analysts’ consensus forecasts of $1.41. Revenues were $296m, above expectations of $293m.ICE shares were up 2.25 per cent at $109.83 at mid-day in New York.
182;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-08-01T19:14:56Z;Supply chain woes threaten global recovery;;Large industrial companies around the world are defying fears of a “double-dip” recession, reporting signs of increasing strength in demand and striking a cautiously optimistic note about the growth of the global economy.Many industrial groups reported better-than-expected profits for the second quarter and raised their full-year growth forecasts. However, big manufacturers could be held back by their inability to secure vital components from supply chains weakened by the downturn and unable to increase production fast enough to meet demand.Caterpillar, FedEx and Honeywell in the US, Honda and Hitachi in Japan, and Siemens in Europe all raised their outlooks last week, while results from companies such as Boeing, Nissan, BASF and VW exceeded analysts’ consensus forecasts.Yet some suppliers to large industrial multinationals that cut costs sharply in the early part of the downturn are finding it hard to increase production capacity rapidly, while many report that financing remains expensive and difficult to access. Manufacturing supply chains in the US and Europe are showing signs of straining to cope with demand.“The problems that suppliers are facing in this upturn are noticeably bigger than in the comparable stages of the recoveries we saw after previous recessions,” said Daniel Corsten, a supply-chain expert at IE business school in Madrid.Some 51 per cent of big US manufacturers said they experienced “significant supply chain disruptions” in the second quarter, while 42 per cent of small and medium-sized suppliers said they had received queries or work from larger companies in need of urgent assistance because of supply chain problems, according to a survey by MFG.com, an online marketplace for manufacturers.Caterpillar, the US-based maker of earth-moving equipment, said last week that many of its most popular products were not being made as quickly as it would like because suppliers had not increased production fast enough. Boeing, the US maker of aircraft, suggested it could struggle to meet demand for commercial aircraft over the next decade because its suppliers might not be able to raise their output accordingly.Supply chain difficulties appear to be particularly affecting electronic components such as semiconductors. Audi and Porsche, the German carmakers, were forced to slow production in some plants last month because their supplier of car radios, Harman Becker, was short of microchips.“Anybody in the electronic supply chain has seen the tightness around certain components,” said Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, last week. Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said “around $50m of revenue maybe got hung up at the end of the quarter in the supply chain”.In response, some companies are building up buffer stocks of components to make sure they have them on hand.Additional reporting by Daniel Schäfer in Frankfurt, Jeremy Lemer in New York, Peter Marsh in London and Jonathan Soble in Tokyo
183;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-07-23T20:31:11Z;US stocks stage late rally;;"Wall Street rallied on Friday afternoon as relief after the results of the European stress tests combined with a possible deal between Sanofi-Aventis and Genzyme and a dividend hike from General Electric to push stocks higher.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,102.66, and up 3.5 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1 per cent to close at 10,424.62, and up 3.2 per cent on the week, and the Nasdaq was 1.1 per cent higher, closing at 2,269.47 and up 4.2 per cent over the five days.The stress test results, released at midday in New York, revealed that only seven out of 91 European banks failed the stress tests.Len Blum, managing partner at Westwood Capital, said there were concerns about how rigorous the tests were and that there was a need for more transparency about the methodology. But he added: “It’s a result that probably gives enough people in the market the confidence that the markets will get through this.”Biotech company Genzyme jumped 15.4 per cent to $62.52 after speculation that French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis, was interested in acquiring the company. Sanofi-Aventis’ US shares fell 4.2 per cent to close at $29.35.General Electric was up 3.3 per cent to $15.71 after it said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent to 12 cents a share and will resume stock buy-backs this quarter, sooner than it had expected. The S&P 500 Industrials sector also rose on the news, up 2 per cent to $260.91.Positive earnings news boosted the markets with Ford reporting second-quarter earnings of 68 cents per share, compared with estimates of 40 cents per share, making its first half the most profitable since 1998. Shares were up 5.3 per cent to $12.73, and the stock has gained 26 per cent for the year to date.Verizon Communications, the largest mobile operator in America, rose by 3.8
per cent to $28.02 after it also reported better-than-
expected earnings.Verizon won customers with Android smartphones and profit, excluding costs to cut jobs, fell to 58 cents from 63 cents for the same period the year before. Analysts had forecast 56 cents a share profit on the same basis.Industrial conglomerate Honeywell rose 2 per cent to $43.51 after profits rose
4 per cent and it boosted its forecast, citing recovering demand for industrial products.Elsewhere the reaction to earnings was negative. Microsoft, which reported after the closing bell on Thursday, lost 0.1 per cent to $25.81 as net income soared 48 per cent to $4.52bn, beating analysts’ forecasts. The world’s largest software maker posted its biggest sales gain in two-and-a-half years.Investors took a dim view of earnings from Amazon, whose shares plunged 12 per cent to its intra-day low, finished the day down just 1 per cent to $118.87, after missing analysts’ estimates due to higher operating costs, when it reported on Thursday.McDonald’s fell 2.1 per cent to $69.90 after the fast-food chain recorded a 12 per cent rise in profit for the second quarter but reported weaker-than-expected sales at established restaurants. Net income just beat expectations at $1.13 per share, compared with the $1.12 average estimate.Also reporting after the markets closed on Thursday, American Express beat analysts’ estimates and the shares rose 3.6 per cent to $44.76, even as the credit card company suffered from weak consumer loan demand.Shares in Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, retreated 3.2 per cent to $59.35 after it reported a 33 per cent
jump in quarterly profit to $818m, in line with analysts’ expectations.Also reporting, Kimberly-Clark rose 1.1 per cent to $63.63 and McGraw-Hill fell 3.5 per cent to $29.65.In other deals news, Quicksilver Resources, the oil and gas company, rose 2.8 per cent to $13.11 on Friday, a day after the company agreed to sell its limited partnership Quicksilver Gas Services, which was up 4.1 per cent to $22.20, to Crestwood Midstream Partners II for $701m."
184;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-07-23T16:13:44Z;Honeywell raises full-year forecast again;;Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, posted better than expected second quarter earnings on Friday and increased its full-year guidance for the second time this year thanks to a recovery in the automotive sector and in demand for industrial products.“We believe the recovery is happening, with improving demand in both our short- and long-cycle businesses. However, given ongoing economic uncertainties, we remain cautious about the near-term outlook,” said Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive.In past months, weak jobs numbers from the US, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and indications that industrial production in Asia is beginning to slow have all weighed on international equity markets.But despite those fears, a slew of second quarter results have suggested that major US industrial groups are successfully picking their way through the uneven global economic recovery, tapping growth in expanding markets and benefiting from tight cost controls elsewhere.Honeywell now expects 2010 sales of between $32.4bn and $32.9bn with earnings per share of between $2.40 and 2.50, up from earlier forecasts of between $2.30 and $2.45 per share.“The industrial economy went down a lot in 2008 and 2009, so some of the percentage changes that you are looking at are big because you are comparing to a low baseline,” said David Anderson, Honeywell’s chief financial officer.“Our forecast for the year now is for revenues that will be $4bn below what we produced in 2008.”Still, the numbers suggest things are getting better for Honeywell. In the three months to the end of June, sales rose 8 per cent to $8.2bn compared with $7.6bn in the second quarter of 2009.The company is also booking new orders faster than it can meet them, a positive sign for future growth.Net income edged up to $476m, from $460m, giving earnings per share of $0.60, the same as 2009. Analysts were expecting earnings of $0.57 cents a share and sales of about $8bn.Honeywell is best known for its aerospace unit, which makes engines and avionics. The company also makes engine-boosting systems for cars and specialty materials such as advanced fibres and composites.The company cut costs sharply during the downturn as it struggled to meet forecasts and reaped the benefit of those actions and better volumes in the second quarter. Margins rose to 13.6 per cent from 12.3 per cent in the same period last year.Mr Anderson said Honeywell had worked hard in the recession to cut expenses without undermining its industrial base - using furloughs as opposed to mass layoffs – and since then had partnered with suppliers to ensure that they were prepared for the recovery.“We went to our suppliers and pushed them on what would they do if they saw 30 per cent upticks in demand. Do you have the raw materials and skilled labour to respond?…That preparedness is reflected in our performance.”Short cycle businesses, which tend to respond earlier in an economic recovery, posted the strongest performance.Sales of transportation systems such as turbochargers for cars and trucks jumped 30 per cent to $1.bn, although the company cautioned that its customers were expecting production rates in the second half, due to weakness in Europe.The aerospace remained a laggard. Sales fell 3 per cent to $2.6bn due to lower sales of parts to makers of business jets, but Honeywell noted that flight hours were increasing and expects sequential improvements in the final part of the year.Honeywell shares climbed about 2.5 per cent to $43.71 in early market trading. The shares are up about 12 per cent over the year to date.
185;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-07-18T23:13:35Z;Engines: Developments tackle fuel use, emissions and noise;;The development of a new engine technology is set to shift up a gear.Pratt & Whitney, the North American aero engine manufacturer, will detail today how it is working towards a next generation of geared turbofans following encouraging results from tests on the core of engines destined for the Bombardier CSeries airliner.The PurePower PW1000G has been chosen for three aircraft in development – the CSeries, the Japanese Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), and the Irkut MC-21 from Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation. The CSeries, from Canada’s Bombardier, is projected to be the first to enter service, in 2013.The engine differs from current turbofans in that it has a gearbox between the turbine and the fan, allowing them both to operate at closer to optimum speeds – the compressor/turbine section works better at high revolutions per minute, while the fan’s speed is limited by the need to keep the tips of the blades in the trans-sonic region.Geared turbofans are one of the technologies being explored by engine makers that will cut fuel consumption by increasing efficiency, offering cheaper running costs. They can also improve environmental performance by reducing emissions and noise.“After five months and 260 hours of testing on the core we’ve validated all our research,” says Bob Saia, vice-president for the next-generation product family at Pratt & Whitney. “A full engine is about 90 per cent completed and will go to test next month.”P&W’s initial target in 2004 for efficiency gains was 12 per cent better than the CFM56 – the benchmark engine from CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric of the US and Snecma of France that has 75 per cent of the market in the small airliner class.That target was moved to 15 per cent in 2007-08, says Mr Saia. “And now we’re projecting 16 per cent improvements.“That will allow the CSeries about $1.5m of savings per aircraft per year – just from the engine.”Noise performance is also improved, with a claimed 50 per cent reduction compared with the CFM56.CFM itself has chosen a more conventional route with its Leap-X advanced turbofan, selected by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China for its C919 narrowbody airliner, scheduled for certification in 2014. CFM also projects a 16 per cent improvement in fuel use over current CFM engines.P&W’s three applications for its PurePower engines range from 15,000lb for the MRJ to 32,000lb for the MC-21.“In the beginning, both airlines and manufacturers were sceptical,” says Mr Saia. “We moved them to be neutral with our initial test results. Now we’ve got them to be very positive.”Despite the slow take-up in orders, P&W is pressing ahead with the technology. “We’re targeting 19-20 per cent better performance by the end of the decade. But we’re also developing the next generation of GTF, the advanced geared turbofan, for 2022-25,” says Mr Saia. “That will give up to 30-35 per cent fuel efficiency improvements compared with the same CFM56.”P&W is a member of International Aero Engines, a joint venture with Rolls-Royce, MTU of Germany and Japan­ese Aero Engines.However, P&W has also said it will offer its own geared turbofan as an option to replace the engines in the Airbus A320 airliner. Rolls-Royce, meanwhile, says a conventional turbofan can offer the required efficiency gains.R-R and CFM are also both working on another technology the geared turbofan is competing with.Open-rotor engines, which have longer, exposed fan blades, are a cross between turbofans and turboprops, in which a turbine drives an exposed propeller. But having the fan blades in the open makes the engine more noisy.Another problem is installation. Open-rotor engines have a larger diameter and are unsuitable as direct replacements for the current generation of turbofans. Thus open-rotor engines of the future are likely to require airframes of the future.In spite of the fact that it has opted for the geared turbofan over open-rotors, The P&W group makes most widely used turboprop engine in its 500-2,000-plus shaft horsepower class, the PT-6. More than 30,000 PT-6 engines have been made since the first was introduced in the 1960s.P&W and Rolls-Royce North America are among the engine manufacturers which were last month awarded contracts by the US Federal Aviation Administration under its Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (Cleen) programme, aimed at im­proving environmental performance by developing new technologies, procedures and fuels.General Electric and Honeywell, along with airframe maker Boeing, share in the five-year award of $125m in FAA funds, which are to be at least matched by the award winners.The programme has the objective of cutting fuel burn by 33 per cent “relative to current subsonic aircraft technology”, as well as reducing energy consumption, emissions and noise.Achieving these objectives by replacing aircraft engines is one option the programme is intended to examine, and GE says open-rotor engine technology is one of the areas it will focus on.

187;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-07-18T17:51:01Z;The job: Test pilot;Helping engineers put together aircraft technology that’s practical;Ever since I was a kid, I have been interested in aeroplanes. I majored in philosophy in college, but just before graduation, I took a couple of flight lessons. I have been flying ever since.My team, which is based in Everett, Washington, works with engineers to develop and test flight safety technology.We’ve worked on ground proximity warning systems, which show the flight staff where they are in relation to the ground or the sides of a mountain, traffic collision avoidance systems, and also airborne weather radar to show the flight crew where the plane is relative to storms. These are now on thousands of aircraft, including the latest enhanced ground proximity warning and traffic system on the Boeing 787, which debuts at the Farnborough air show t his week.The pilots help the engineers put together technology that’s practical. We then use a prototype of it in a plane and fly hundreds of hours to test it.We try out different scenarios. We may take two or three planes and fly them towards each other. We may chase thunderstorms and wind shears.I’ve worked with some genius engineers and I’ve seen unbelievable changes in airline safety as a result of the work they’ve done. I’m just the lucky guy who drives the aeroplane around for them.As told to Rebecca Knight
188;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;EADS offers solo US tanker bid;;EADS, the European aerospace and defence group, on Thursday submitted a solo bid to supply refuelling tankers to the US Air Force, throwing down the gauntlet to US rival Boeing.“We’re proud of our offering, which is the only one in this competition that is flying and refuelling the full array of receiver aircraft,” said Ralph Crosby, EADS North America chairman, adding that “we are confident in the superior capabilities” of its tanker.To underscore that confidence, EADS said that it was moving its 150 strong programme team to Mobile, Alabama where it plans to build the tankers, in order to be ready to work on the contact should it win.The submission concludes a remarkable turnround for EADS which was rocked in March when its long time partner, Northrop Grumman pulled out of the contest arguing the team could not win because the rules favoured Boeing’s smaller aircraft.Boeing is expected to submit an offer by Friday, the closing date for bids in the long-running contest.Still EADS, and its airpcraft manufacturing subsidiary Airbus, suffered a setback after the World Trade Organisation delayed its initial findings on a European Union challenge to the US over aircraft subsidies.EADS had hoped that the report would counterbalance criticism from US Congressional leaders who have argued that years of state subsidies for EADS have allowed it to undercut Boeing on price in the tanker contest.The trade panel had been expected to issue its confidential interim report on an EU countersuit over US aid to Boeing on July 16, two weeks after the WTO ruled that Airbus had received illegal aid from European governments.Airbus responded with dismay. Tom Enders, Airbus president and chief executive said he was “surprised and disappointed”.The tanker bids potentially open the final chapter in what has been a bitter and protracted process to replace the USAF’s aging fleet of “flying petrol stations”, as the tankers are sometimes known.In 2004, Boeing was awarded a $20bn contract to supply the tankers, but that contract was rescinded after an ethics scandal which led to jail time for a leading Boeing executive.The competition was re-tendered and unexpectedly won by Northrop-EADS in 2008, only for Boeing to successfully protest by raising concerns about US protectionism. One more bid process also fell to pieces at the early stages, before the current round.EADS described its bid as volumnious. The teams are required to submit six sets of documents, and EADS said each set had over 8,000 pages and weighs about 100 pounds.For the companies involved the stakes are high. The contract could be worth up to $50bn to supply an initial 179 refuelling tankers. Follow on deals could bring the total contract value to more than $100bn.Moreover strategic considerations add to the deals significance. EADS has long desired a manufacturing foothold in the world’s largest defense market, while Boeing is eager to retain a prestigious contract and keep out a major rival.In submitting its final bid, EADS on Thursday revealed a list of its key suppliers for the first time. They include GE, Rockwell Collins and Honeywell.Earlier in the year, leading executives had said they were reluctant to identify their partners for fear that they would be subject to undue political pressures – an indication of the heightened sensitivities involved.Indeed, in recent weeks the rhetoric from both sides has heated up considerably, with the companies running advertising campaigns in Washington DC and key congressional districts in the hope of winning political support for their bids.Despite professing respect for the government officials responsible for chosing the winning bidder, both sides have emphasised the flaws of their opponents models above the virtues of their own aircraft.EADS is offering a modified version of its A330 aircraft while Boeing is set to offer a version of its 767.Department of defense officials will now subject the two parties to detailed question and answer sessions and consultations before awarding the contract some time in the autumn, possibly on November 12.

——————————————————————————————————–In an effort to streamline its exposure to the aerospace and defense sector, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) is selling its Pacific Scientific subsidiary, three sources familiar with the situation told mergermarket.According to one of the sources, the Washington, DC-based conglomerate hired Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor for the divestiture.Danaher did not return calls for comment while Goldman Sachs declined comment on market rumors or speculation.A teaser on Pacific Scientific has been out for approximately two weeks, the second source claimed, adding that a preliminary proposal on the business is due within the next week.A limited number of parties, believed to be entirely strategic, were contacted in relation to the divestiture, said the first source. The two additional sources said financial sponsors would be interested in the Danaher division, speculating that private equity suitors may be contacted if the process widens.The second source said Pacific Scientific has EBITDA of approximately USD 130m, adding that the business could command a multiple in the ballpark of 8x EBITDA. This source characterized Pacific Scientific as a “hodge podge” of different businesses including aerospace and defense assets as well as fire safety equipment.Potential buyers for Pacific Scientific could include actuation companies such as Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Eaton (NYSE:ETN), Moog (NYSE:MOG.A), Curtiss-Wright (NYSE:CW) and Woodward Governor (NASDAQ:WGOV), said the third source.——————————————————————————————————–For more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@mergermarket.com or call EMEA: + 44 (0)20 7059 6105 Americas: +1 212 686-5277 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9730"
190;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-06-08T22:24:22Z;European industry: At turbine tempo;;Pietro Carnaghi’s factory in northern Italy looks like a temple to the best that European industry can offer. In a cavernous new assembly hall, machines more than 11 metres high are being built to be shipped to China and Brazil. The company is the world’s leading maker of vertical lathes – used to hollow out the casings of turbines and jet engines – and its know-how means the machines have a tolerance of under 10 microns, or millionths of a metre.With a 60 per cent share of the world market, business is booming. “This year will be a record,” says Flavio Radice, the chief executive. Revenues should reach €100m this year, up from €82m. “Anyone all over the world who wants to build a turbine, which is the first element of a power station, has to buy such machines so they will come here,” he adds proudly.European industry as a whole is, like Pietro Carnaghi, enjoying a strong recovery from the deep recession. With all the sound and fury over Europe’s high debt and poor public finances, it has been easy to overlook the performance of the factory floor. But buoyed by strong demand from emerging markets, the strength of the industrial rebound has taken companies and economists by surprise. Production at European manufacturers expanded at the fastest pace in a decade in April.However, just as that increasing dependence on countries such as China and India is causing concern for the future of Europe’s industrial base in the long term, so the eurozone’s debt problems are provoking more immediate concern about whether the recovery could be derailed. “The real economy is recovering, and faster than expected. But my worry is that if the reaction of [eurozone] governments isn’t quick enough, then companies that are thinking of investing again will decide not to,” says Marco Tronchetti Provera, chief executive of Pirelli, the Italian tyremaker.Just down the road from Pietro Carnaghi near Milan’s Malpensa airport is Tacchi, one of the world’s leading makers of horizontal lathes used to make casings for the oil industry and shafts for turbines. Giacomo Tacchi, chief executive, is looking to a rise in sales this year of up to 20 per cent as companies such as General Electric in the US and groups in India snap up his machines for anywhere between €450,000 and €5m.He is unconcerned about the fallout from Greece’s debt crisis. “Because our market is based on export to countries like China and India, we can be not too much affected by it. Of course, the European and American markets could eventually be affected but most of our customers there export their products to China or Brazil,” he says.That confidence is represented in statistics showing European industry expanding even as concern remains about other areas such as consumer confidence and services. The pick-up has been especially strong in Germany as the export powerhouse of Europe feeds on global demand and reaps the benefits of a falling euro. The latest data from May show a divergence between the optimism of bosses and more frightened purchasing managers as strong growth eased.Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, says there is little evidence of the industrial rebound broadening out into other parts of the economy: “You need to see that rebound in industry feed through to the jobs market and consumer confidence for the economy really to recover.”Many of the largest companies in Europe are seeing surprisingly strong profit margins considering the recession has only just ended. Ben Uglow, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, points to a current underlying margin at Siemens of about 12 per cent, about double the level of its profitability at the midpoint of the previous cycle in 2006. Similarly at Philips, the Dutch technology group, margins are running at a record 12.3 per cent. “In the underlying industrial economy today, things are very good and they are getting better,” he says.For all that, the fallout from Europe’s debt problems remains the big unknown. Mr Uglow highlights expectations from many investors in industrial companies that there may be a double-dip recession. Many chief executives remained bullish well into the summer of 2008, shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, leading him to add: “Experience suggests that management is a lagging indicator and some of their comments at the moment remind me of May 2008.”A senior economist at a US bank who keeps a close eye on industry says managers are watching the situation with “bewilderment”, wondering whether this is the moment when chaos in the markets spills over into the real economy: “They are asking: ‘is this like Lehman?’ ” He thinks another industrial recession is unlikely: “Both inventory and investment have been cut back so much there is hardly any way for them to go down.” Still, despite the nascent recovery, many factories are running at well below capacity and below their pre-crisis levels.The silver lining in the debt cloud for companies is the fall in the euro from its peak of $1.60 to its current level of $1.19. About half the trade of eurozone nations takes place with countries outside the single currency area. But even a weak euro is no panacea. Economists say most companies will not feel a big change until the second half of the year.Groups such as Airbus, Daimler and BMW will still receive a shot in the arm of hundreds of millions of euros. For others such as Tacchi, the effect is more limited. “It has helped a little bit. In the US, customers can find it more interesting to buy our machines. But all our rivals are European,” Mr Tacchi says. Mr Radice at Pietro Carnaghi agrees it helps but adds: “Our best year ever in the US was last year when the euro was at $1.50.” His daughter-in-law, Stefania Carnaghi, who works in the company as well, says: “The currency is unpredictable and that creates an uncertainty, with companies thinking again about investments.”Morgan Stanley’s Mr Uglow agrees, pointing to wider problems in financial markets: “The uncertainty we are seeing today means that when infrastructure companies set their budgets for 2011 later this year, how confident will they be to invest millions?”Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Daimler, maker of Mercedes cars frets that a weakening euro could signify a weakening European economy.There are also concerns about the strength of Europe’s smallest companies, which make up a bigger part of the continent’s economy than in the US or Asia. Such companies are feeling the effects of being starved of credit and thousands are expected to go bankrupt. Alessandro Profumo, chief executive of Unicredit, one of Europe’s largest banks, says: “The big industrial companies are resilient but there are many small companies that are suffering quite a lot.”The problem is being felt even in Germany, where the BDI business lobby group has joined Italian companies in warning of the danger of a renewed credit crunch, particularly if regulators again tighten capital requirements for banks.The answer of many companies to such concerns is to point at their dizzying growth in emerging markets. Schneider Electric, a large French electrical engineering group, saw a 23 per cent rise in first-quarter sales in Asia just about offset falls in the rest of the world. European groups such as Philips and Renault aim to have half of their sales coming from emerging markets within five years.But that is stoking fears about the future of industry on the continent. B.G. Srinivas, the thoughtful European head of Infosys, the Indian information technology company, delivers the mantra of many of the continent’s chief executives: “My worry is about Europe, not about European business.” He explains: “Most of the future investment by European companies is outside Europe and that is a big problem for the continent. The real tilting of the needle will take place when the innovation goes out of Europe – that will be bad.”The problem is that with most of the growth coming from outside Europe, so is most of the investment. Peter Löscher, chief executive of Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering group, talks of “global competitiveness” – seemingly shorthand for how most of the group’s new manufacturing plants are in emerging markets. Instead, he believes Europe’s future is in areas such as government-backed clean technology and industrial services. The latter means operations such as maintenance and support, which give customers not just a product but something that works for a guaranteed period of time or at a certain efficiency rate.“What are you offering your key customers? Are you offering a windmill or [also its] up-time? It is a major differentiating factor, especially against emerging-market competitors,” says Mr Löscher.It is not just the biggest companies that are moving abroad. Pietro Carnaghi, with its 216 employees, is considering building plants in China and the US as part of the next stage in its development. “We would keep the technology here and maybe build the infrastructure over there,” Mr Radice says, although the company is also thinking of expanding its Italian factory considerably as well.The big long-term concern, however, is over the hollowing out of Europe’s industrial base. Feike Sijbesma, chief executive of DSM, the Dutch life sciences group, says: “There is an extreme danger in Europe that we want to shift to a knowledge economy. What do we need? R&D – great. Do we need manufacturing? No, we don’t. Is manufacturing connected to R&D? In most cases, yes. Mostly when manufacturing moves out then R&D follows shortly behind. So you will eventually lose the R&D too.”He points to DSM’s own experience. Five years ago it had no R&D in China. Now it will soon have 100 people there. “Why? Because we have manufacturing there,” he says.Hans Wijers, chief executive of Akzo Nobel, the world’s largest paint company, also worries about Europe’s long-term industrial future. He links that debate to its current economic health: “If there will continue to be low growth, you will see deindustrialisation, not just in low-value products but also in high-value ones, which would be the end of the basis of our wealth. Successful global companies typically have a strong home market and it is essential for Europe to keep that.”
191;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Clouds of recession begin to disperse;;First came news that the glut of aircraft up for sale was no longer swelling so rapidly and the dive in used business jet prices appeared to be levelling off.Then reports emerged that the number of business jet flights in the US and Europe was edging up.Finally, the crisis that has gripped much of the corporate aviation industry since the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008 looks as if it has stabilised. But the sector is still far from being in vibrant health.“The good news is that the market has stopped falling, and some of the leading indicators offer encouragement,” says Richard Aboulafia, analyst at the Virginia-based Teal Group aerospace and defence consultancy.“The bad news is that this is a three-year downturn. The key driver, corporate profits, show only limited signs of a recovery. Used aircraft prices remain weak. Also, it will take some time to reduce high inventories of available jets. We do not see deliveries growth resuming until 2012.”Others share his sentiment. Analysts at UBS Investment Research said in April in their business jet update that even though leading indicators showed the market had stabilised, threats remained.“We see risk of a muted recovery given significant oversupply, fractional weakness and tight financing,” they said.Ahead of this year’s European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (Ebace) in Geneva, some of the region’s biggest players are equally cautious about what lies ahead.At NetJets Europe, the continent’s largest business jet group, Eric Connor, chairman and chief executive, says he has a “quiet confidence for 2010”, after a turbulent 12-month period that has encompassed staff cuts, aircraft delivery deferrals and an extensive shake-up of the company’s top executives.The fractional ownership group has seen a 12.7 per cent increase in hours flown in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same quarter last year, and a 60 per cent increase in jet card sales to its customers.“Overall, we lost 83 customers in the first quarter of 2009 and we have gained 32 customers in the first quarter of 2010, so the difference there is pleasant,” says Mr Connor.“If I compare flight revenues, we are approximately 13 per cent above what we budgeted and the revenue flights are above what was in 2009 for the same period.“We’re also beginning to see some customers who left us in 2008 and 2009 expressing an interest in returning, which we take to be positive.”The fractional ownership sector more broadly is under pressure, according to new data published on Tuesday by Honeywell Aerospace in an international refocusing of its latest Business Aviation Outlook.“Owners of fleets serving fractional shareholders and jet card purchasers have reduced demand sharply in the current recession,” says Honeywell. “Fractional fleet operators still account for about 10 to 12 per cent of the backlog for business jets, but have drastically curtailed current new aircraft additions in the face of net share sales erosion.“New jet deliveries to fractional fleet operators were off more than 80 per cent in 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, no new jet aircraft have been delivered to major fractional providers. Sales of new ownership shares have continued to deteriorate further after 2009 posted a 52 per cent loss. As a result, Honeywell is projecting much lower deliveries into this segment as excess capacity is worked off and shareholder levels are rebuilt.”At TAG Aviation, the Switzerland-based private aircraft management and charter company, and owner of Farnborough airport, the most important base for private jet travel in the UK, Robert Wells, the chief executive, is slightly more upbeat.“I’ve seen four up-and-down cycles in my business aviation career,” he says. “Each time the recovery has been stronger than the previous one, so I’m optimistic about the current state of affairs.”Mr Wells is focusing on Africa. “One encouraging sign recently was the first delivery of the new Bombardier Global Express XRS to a customer in Nigeria. That says a lot about how much room there remains for business aviation to grow,” he says.Simon Pryce, chief executive of BBA Aviation, the world’s leading provider of service bases for business jets, says the basic foundations of the industry are strong and near-term indications are positive.But as Mr Aboulafia points out, there are huge differences within the industry in terms of which parts have been hardest hit.“The most unusual aspect of the market right now is the unprecedented bifurcation of market behaviour,” he says.“The top half of the market – jets costing $25m and above – barely felt any pain last year, with deliveries falling a mere 4.1 per cent. The bottom half – jets costing $4m to $24m – fell by a catastrophic 42.8 per cent. The market has never seen bifurcation like this.”It is difficult to find anyone willing to forecast an early return of the boom times, when business jet deliveries surged to more than 1,000 in a single year for the first time in 2007, and rose again to more than 1,300 in 2008.Last year, that number was 870, according to the General Aviation Manufacturer’s Association’s annual industry review released in February.According to the Ascend aerospace consultancy, annual global business jet deliveries will not go above 1,300 again until 2016.But such forecasts need to be put in perspective given the nature of the boom that preceded the bust, says Gary Crichlow, a senior analyst at Ascend.“I think the market is still having difficulty getting its head round realising 2008 was the peak,” he says.Mr Crichlow remembers “Crisis what crisis?” headlines in 2008. “Over the past couple of years we have seen that the business aviation market is like any other industry,” he says.“The party ended quite harshly. But, two years on, we are seeing it’s the same old economic cycle. The fundamentals that underline the business jet industry haven’t changed.”
192;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-05-03T20:00:33Z;Europe set to lead new business jet sales;;Europe is emerging as an unexpected bright spot in the battered global business jet industry, says a new forecast from Honeywell, one of the world’s largest suppliers of aviation and aerospace equipment.Corporate jet companies in Europe have the earliest plans to resume “significant” new jet purchases, said the US manufacturer, ahead of those in Asia and the Middle East, traditionally regions with the most buoyant buying plans.In contrast, companies in North America, home of the world’s largest business jet fleet, “remained the most conservative and exhibited considerable uncertainty as to the specific timing of planned new jet purchases”, said Honeywell, whose business jet operator surveys are considered one of the most authoritative guides to the fortunes of the industry.“Clearly the less severe contraction in parts of Europe, coupled with rebounding energy prices bolstering Russia, have acted to support a stronger outlook toward new jet purchases in the region,” said Paolo Carmassi, Honeywell’s aerospace president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.“Though few purchases are planned immediately, the operators surveyed say they intend to schedule up to 80 per cent of their demand between 2010 and 2013, much more front-loaded than any other region.”Rob Wilson, president of business and general aviation at Honeywell Aerospace, said it was obvious many economies outside North America did not experience as deep a contraction as that felt in the US during the global recession.“For Europe these are pretty promising results. There are good indicators for the market for business jets in the region,” he said.As for the industry’s prospects in Asia, he said: “In Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai business jet activity is alive and well. Activity in these regions is increasing significantly.”But much of the outlook remains gloomy in the Honeywell forecasts, released on the eve of this week’s European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition in Geneva, one of the industry’s largest regular gatherings.The number of new business jets to be delivered worldwide in 2010 is likely to slump to just 700, a sharp drop from the 1,139 deliveries seen 2008, the year an extraordinary boom in the business jet industry peaked.While the survey suggests potential demand for more than 5,000 aircraft globally between 2010 and 2014, it notes problems in some important areas of the industry, such as fractional fleet operators, who sell shares in aircraft to clients in return for guaranteed access, and account for about 10 to 12 per cent of the order backlog for business jets. They have “drastically curtailed” new aircraft additions, said Honeywell.As well, the glut in used jets on the market has seen prices fall sharply. “Over the last year, asking prices have begun to rapidly decline, first for older used models, but more recently, newer model jets have begun to see significant price erosion,” said Honeywell. “Average pricing is estimated to be 20-to-25 percent lower than a year ago after several years of gradual increases.”The financial crisis that followed the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008 saw the business jet sector hit harder than any other in the aerospace industry, whether commercial or military.As corporations large and small cut their use of jets, the market plunged more than 24 per cent, by value of deliveries, between 2008 and 2009, says analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Virginia-based Teal Group.Honeywell, whose biggest customers include Boeing, Airbus and the US defence department, has itself suffered in the downturn: reporting its first-quarter earnings last month it said its aerospace division, unlike other major business lines, suffered a 9 per cent fall in revenues compared with the first quarter of 2009, thanks to lower sales to business aviation and regional customers.

But the US company that makes it is now pledging to be more aggressive than smooth in its attempts to build its business so that its civil side matches the sales success of its military contracts.Bell Helicopter has in recent years lost market share in civil helicopter sales to rivals such as Eurocopter and AgustaWestland. But the current overall market is a tough one.Honeywell Aerospace predicted earlier this year in its Turbine-Powered Civil Helicopter Purchase Outlook “flat overall deliveries of new civil-use helicopters during the period 2010-14 compared to the 2005-09 period”.It put the number of new deliveries from this year to 2014 at 3,750 to 4,250, with purchase expectations sliding in Europe and North America, but rising in Latin America and Africa/Middle East.In its late-February outlook Honeywell, one of the world’s largest suppliers to the aerospace industry, pointed out that deliveries last year fell below the peak in 2008 and it expected a further decline this year and next, as the woes of the world economy continue to impact aviation.Corporate use accounts for about 36 per cent of projected new turbine helicopter sales around the world, according to Honeywell, followed by law enforcement at 16 per cent and emergency medical services at 15 per cent, the utility category at a similar percentage, and oil and gas support at 8 per cent.The makers of helicopters for corporate use have not seen any easing in their situation since that outlook was published, according to leading analyst Mark Wooller of the International Bureau of Aviation, the consultancy.“All of the major manufacturers are suffering in their commercial programmes,” Mr Wooller says. “The exceptions are sales to the offshore oil and gas industry and for emergency medical services, which are relatively buoyant.”But the impact on civil helicopter sales has not been uniform.“Single turbine helicopters have suffered the most in the past two years,” says Mr Wooller. “Medium twins upwards, including heavy machinery, have been more buoyant – because of demand from the oil and gas industry.”This has squeezed Bell Helicopter, an arm of US conglomerate Textron along with business and light aircraft manufacturer Cessna, disproportionately.“A lot of Bell’s traditional market has been those single-engined helicopters,” says Mr Wooller. “The new 429 is their attempt to get a slice of the medium twin market.”John Garrison, who was named president and chief executive of Bell last August, says the 429 – flight tested by me for the FT Weekend magazine last year – “is going to be a particular success in the European market, where twin-engine helicopters are very important”.European regulations requiring multi-engines for helicopter flights over congested areas and in limited visibility help push European purchase plans towards twin-turbine helicopters – 57 per cent, in this year’s Honeywell outlook. That compares with North America, where a different regulatory environment means that 60 per cent of planned purchases are for single-engine helicopters.Overall, Bell expects civil sales this year to be roughly the same as last year at about 150 units.But Mr Garrison says strong orders for the 429 worldwide are “helping to offset some of the flat market conditions”.Bell is also receiving a fillip from the second of its three arms (the third is its service side). Military orders have “grown substantially, both domestically and from other countries such as Mexico, Pakistan and Iraq”, says Mr Garrison. “Those sales are helping to offset softness on the commercial side.”Mr Wooller says that is true not just for Bell. “Military programmes have been the mainstay for helicopter makers during the past 18 months to two years,” he says.Among the other main western manufacturers, AgustaWestland, the Anglo-Italian group that is part of the Italian Finmeccanica group, earlier this year formally unveiled the Grand New light twin, a version of the Grand with advanced avionics including synthetic vision. According to Mr Wooller, advanced technology such as the four-axis digital autopilot on AgustaWestland’s larger AW139 is proving highly popular with oil companies.Sikorsky, the subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation of the US, saw the first flight of its S-76D in February this year. It too is bristling with new technology, in the cockpit and outside, including a dual-speed rotor that cuts noise especially on approach to landing. Tim Fox, S-76 programme manager, says: “We have about 80 aircraft orders on our books. There has been a bit of attrition but we’re starting to see an upswing.”AgustaWestland partners Bell in the development of the civil version of the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey military Tilt Rotor. Progress is slow, but Mr Garrison says “we are continuing to make an engineering investment”. And despite reports of difficulties between the two partners, “the relationship is quite strong and very open”, he says.Looking forward, he points to the Honeywell outlook, which indicates an acceleration in orders in 2012. “All our crystal balls are a bit hazy,” he says, “but that’s the way we see it too.”As for Bell’s part of that upturn, Mr Garrison is emphatic. “I want the market to know that we mean to grow all three elements of our business across the globe. The 429 gives us the opportunity to do that.“I’m not at all satisfied – we’re going to be aggressive. You’re going to see us being aggressive all across the globe. We’re going to go back to the things that have made Bell successful for the past 60 years.”Rohit Jaggi’s test flight of the Bell 429

195;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-04-23T16:17:53Z;Honeywell increases full-year guidance;;Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, beat first-quarter earnings estimates and increased its full-year guidance thanks to a recovery in the automotive sector and in demand for automation products.“Our markets stabilised towards the end of last year and now there are signs of improvement”, said David Anderson, Honeywell’s chief financial officer. “Orders are up and that is making us feel good that the industrial economy is recovering.”The comments chime with the latest macroeconomic data showing a gathering recovery in global manufacturing that has benefited other industrial conglomerates, such as Eaton Corp and United Technologies, in the first quarter.The company said that full-year revenues would likely be between $31.5bn and $32.3bn, a modest increase from its forecast at the start of the year of sales of between $31.3bn and $32.2bn.Full-year profits will fall somewhere between $2.30 and $2.45 per share, up from earlier predictions of $2.20 to $2.40 per share, but below analysts’ more optimistic forecasts.“It’s still too soon to assume the early cycle upticks from the first quarter will continue at the same pace,” Mr Anderson said.Nigel Coe, with Deutsche Bank, suggested the company was being conservative with its guidance. “It is clear that Honeywell has given themselves plenty of room for manoeuvre.”Honeywell shares slipped 1 per cent to $47.08 in early trading.Honeywell is best known for its aerospace unit, which makes engines and avionics. The company also makes engine-boosting systems for cars and specialty materials such as advanced fibres and composites.In the three months to the end of March, revenue grew 3 per cent to $7.8bn compared with 2009 but was flat when currency effects are excluded.The transportation segment was particularly strong, booking a 33 per cent rise in sales, and Honeywell also benefited from improved orders in its automations business as customers bought equipment to boost their productivity and output.Aerospace remained a drag. Revenue fell 9 per cent to $2.5bn although Mr Anderson said that the segment was seeing sequential improvements in orders. “That suggests that by the fourth quarter we will see revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.”Net income was broadly flat at $393m, or $0.50 per share, compared with $397, or $0.54 per share, in 2009. Excluding non-cash pension expenses, profits grew 21 per cent to $0.68 per share compared with the first quarter of 2009.During the downturn, Honeywell cut costs sharply as it struggled to meet forecasts. Mr Anderson said that this year the company was looking to rebuild revenues while maintaining cost discipline.“As volumes continue to recover, the leverage off this lower cost base should be considerable,” said Rob Stallard with Macquarie Securities. “As economic fundamentals improve, Honeywell should see steady top line growth and margin expansion.”Mr Anderson highlighted some risks ahead, notably the possibility of raw material cost inflation and the readiness of suppliers to respond to a rapid upturn in volumes.The company is already seeing a shortage of some electronic components he said and has responded by monitoring supply chains more closely and building up inventories of hard-to-obtain materials as “insurance.”
196;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-04-15T16:39:57Z;India eyes use of drones against Maoists;;Indian security chiefs are testing unmanned aerial surveillance drones – made by US-based Honeywell International – for potential use in the battle against Maoist guerrillas, who killed 76 paramilitaries in an ambush last week.The demonstrations, carried out this week in the central state of Chhattisgarh, came amid a heated parliamentary debate – and the eruption of disputes within the ruling Congress party – over how India should respond to the Maoist rebels, who now control territory in remote tribal areas.“This battle can’t be fought half-heartedly,” Arun Jaitley, a senior leader of the Hindu nationalist opposition Bharatiya Janata party, told India’s upper house of parliament. “We can’t afford to do that. This battle has to be won.”The massacre last week of 76 Central Reserve Police Force troops – the highest toll inflicted on Indian security personnel in a single incident – has propelled the conflict to the top of New Delhi’s agenda.P. Chidambaram, the interior minister, is seeking greater air power to support efforts by state police and paramilitary forces against the well-trained and highly motivated militants, who operate over a large area across many states, where state forces are reluctant to move beyond main roads.The drone tested this week – Honeywell’s T-Hawk Micro Air Vehicle – weighs just 17lbs, can be carried into the jungle and then can hover at 10,000ft for around 50 minutes, streaming real-time images to forces on the ground.Advocates say the drones could boost India’s capacity to battle the rebels, although others say they are too noisy and would alert the Maoists to security forces’ presence.But within the Congress party, some leaders feel that defeating the Maoists will depend less on high technology than on reaching out to long-neglected and alienated tribal people, who now actively support the leftist guerrillas.Tensions on the issue within the ruling party spilled into the public realm this week when Digvijay Singh, a senior Congress party leader, accused Mr Chidambaram of “intellectual arrogance” and of being “extremely rigid once he makes up his mind.”“He is treating [this] purely as a law and order problem without taking into consideration the issues that affect the tribals,” Mr Singh wrote in a newspaper column. “We can’t solve this problem by ignoring the hopes and aspirations of the people living in these areas.”The BJP has seized on the divisions within the ruling party, warning on Thursday that the Maoists could be just a few years away from encircling cities.“Unless there is a complete unanimity of purpose,” warned Yashwant Sinha, a BJP parliament member, “we will not win this war.”
197;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Struggling Qinetiq steeled for turnround;;"Leo Quinn has been at the helm of Qinetiq for less than six months but he has already put his employees on notice that the status quo is no longer an option. Change – painful change – is on the way.In an e-mail to UK staff last week he wrote: “I don’t believe any one of you will be surprised when I say Qinetiq is facing the toughest economic and business environment in its history.“Independent third-party forecasts in the run-up to the general election are already talking about healthcare and education budgets being maintained and consequently other public sector budgets, including defence, being potentially reduced by 20 per cent.”The reduced spending, coupled with growing competitive pressures on the defence industry, highlighted the need to remain competitive. “Qinetiq could not be left standing,” he added.The e-mail is emblematic of Mr Quinn’s hands-on approach, which sets him apart from Graham Love, his predecessor who oversaw the flotation of Qinetiq in 2006 and controversially made a fortune in the process.One shareholder said: “Quinn seemed incredibly straightforward, hard-nosed and unemotional”.Mr Quinn is certainly no stranger to turnrounds. Previously head of De La Rue, the banknote maker, he oversaw its privatisation in 2003 and subsequent flotation in 2006. He cut his teeth at Honeywell International, the US aerospace group, where he reorganised and sold its UK security business.Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, a US investment group which also owns a small stake in De La Rue, is certainly backing him; since his appointment was announced the fund has become Qinetiq’s largest shareholder, holding just over 10 per cent.But at Qinetiq Mr Quinn faces some tough choices. He takes on a company that has been at the cutting edge of defence technology since the second world war but which has never come close to fulfilling the promise set out at flotation: to commercialise its intellectual property heritage.Dera, Qinetiq’s government-owned predecessor, invented liquid crystal displays, carbon fibre and flat- panel loudspeakers, to name a few innovations.Qinetiq is being squeezed on all fronts. It issued a second profit warning in as many months in January, saying it would not experience the traditional boost to second-half sales this year.The immediate problems are twofold. In the UK, the Ministry of Defence, from which it was spun off, remains its biggest single customer.But the ministry is grappling with its own budgetary constraints, leading to delays in handing out consultancy projects that Qinetiq has usually picked up.In the US, which accounts for about half of sales, Qinetiq’s military products division has been squeezed by changes in policy towards Afghanistan.The company had previously won lucrative orders for its bomb disposal robots and protective armour for frontline troops.Cutting costs is imperative but Qinetiq’s cost structure makes this prohibitively expensive.Analysts at UBS said last month the historic cost-to-saving ratio has been 3-to-1. They warned the cost of redundancies was likely to push Qinetiq close to its debt covenant levels, leaving no cash to pay a dividend. With trading unlikely to improve and a gross pension liability of £700m to consider, a fundraising cannot be discounted, UBS said at the time.The analysts, downgrading the stock to a “sell”, said: “Were Qinetiq to decide to raise equity, given a market capitalisation of circa £1bn, it would [be] likely [to] create material dilution for current shareholders”.The news sent the shares down 4.5 per cent to 135p. On Thursday they closed at 136p – a far cry from their float price of 200p in February 2006.A rights issue, however, would not be welcomed by all shareholders. One top 10 shareholder said: “It would be better if we did not have to see any dilution”, adding that “sometimes new management, with better working practices, can get better returns”.Mr Quinn will present his turnround strategy at Qinetiq’s full-year results on May 27 and the City expects significant redundancies as well as potential impairment charges on recent acquisitions.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who have a “buy” recommendation on the stock, said they regarded the event as a positive catalyst for the stock “as the bad news is somewhat expected” and should combine with the review to be positively welcomed by investors.Mr Quinn could also decide to sell some parts of the business. One radical option would be a break-up, separating the US business, which is seen as having better growth prospects.It is an option that is understood to have been discussed at board level when Mr Love was still chief executivePushing through the restructuring will not be easy, especially as Mr Quinn already faces union opposition to some elements of his plan.But he also needs to expand the business and find new orders.Long-term company watchers believe that in spite of its US expansion, Qinetiq took too long and has not gone far enough in diversifying away from working for the MoD.Finding growth – and quickly – will be Mr Quinn’s biggest challenge."

Downgrades for Greek bank ratings further weighed on risk appetite.The ADP jobs report showed that private employers in the US shed 23,000 jobs in March, compared with expectations for a 40,000 rise.The report attracted more attention from investors than usual as it excluded temporary US census hiring and the effects of the severe winter weather in February.By the close, the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent down at 1,169.44, ending the quarter up 4.8 per cent – its best first-quarter performance since 1998.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 10,856.56, but was up 4.1 per cent during the quarter – its best first-quarter performance since 1999. The Nasdaq was 0.5 per cent lower at 2,397.96, and 5.7 per cent higher over the quarter.Honeywell International, a maker of controls for aircraft and buildings, was in focus, rising 0.7 per cent to $45.27 as the company increased its first-quarter profit forecast to 45-49 cents per share, from 40-45 cents previously. The company cited improving customer order trends.The stock’s target price was upgraded from $38 to $45 by JPMorgan, and from $46 to $52 by Jefferies, with the “buy” rating reiterated.“Honeywell has an attractive collection of businesses that we believe have the potential to earn consistent and sustainable above-
average returns,” said Howard Rubel, analyst at Jefferies.Chiquita Brands fell 4.7 per cent to $15.73 after the fruit producer said it expected first-quarter results to be “substantially lower” than a year earlier as weak European banana demand had a negative impact on sales.Offshore oil and gas drillers were boosted by President Barack Obama’s decision to open a vast stretch of the Atlantic coastline to offshore oil and gas drilling on the east coast of the US.Diamond Offshore Drilling rallied 4 per cent to $88.81, Rowan gained 3.5 per cent to $29.11 and Nabors Industries climbed 1.5 per cent to $19.63.US-listed Unilever shares rallied 1.2 per cent to $30.16 as the food conglomerate was upgraded from “neutral” to “buy” by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The session’s three initial public offerings had mixed performances.Meru Networks, a networking equipment maker, rose 27.8 per cent to $19.17 after selling about 4.4m shares at $15m each.SS&C rose 0.5 per cent to $15.08 after the company that makes trading, modelling and portfolio management software sold 10.7m shares at $15.However, oil and petroleum transporter Scorpio Tankers fell 3.4 per cent to $12.56 after selling 12.5m shares for $13, below the $14-$16 range originally indicated.Isis Pharmaceuticals climbed 6.1 per cent to $10.93 on news that the company had signed a development deal with UK-based GlaxoSmithKline that may be worth as much as $1.5bn, plus royalties, for the biotech company. The partnership will focus on treatments for rare and infectious diseases.Rite Aid, a leading US drugstore chain, lost 11.2 per cent to $1.50 after the company forecast a larger-than-expected loss for the year, citing falling earnings from generic drugs.Losses for the year could reach 65 cents per share, the company said, compared with consensus estimates of a loss of 37 cents per share.Saic, a science and engineering company that has a strong presence in the US national security sector, tumbled 6.7 per cent to $17.70 after reporting fourth-quarter results that missed estimates.A challenging defence spending environment has led to a longer federal-
decision making process, the company said, warning that it could impact its current year earnings.A-Power Energy Generation Systems, a China-based wind turbine manufacturer, fell 11.1 per cent to $10.70 as the company forecast full-year revenues of $380m, well below consensus analyst expectations of about $543m."
199;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-02-26T03:04:57Z;Europe keeps a close eye on US;;That European antitrust regulators scrutinise the activities of large US companies is hardly remarkable: Europe is a big market and many US companies have global reach. More surprising, perhaps, is that they have, on occasion, taken a harder line than their US regulatory counterparts.Such scenarios are rare, but four cases stand out over the past 15 years.In 1997, Seattle-based Boeing wanted to take over rival aerospace manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, a $16bn deal which had the backing of the Pentagon and was approved unconditionally by the US Federal Trade Commission. But it ran into problems with the then-EU competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, and was only cleared when Boeing offered some 11th-hour concessions.Three years later, General Electric tried to take over Honeywell, an engineering-based conglomerate. The $41bn deal was given conditional approval by the US authorities, but it was opposed by Mario Monti, who had succeeded Mr Van Miert as Europe’s top competition watchdog. His concerns centred on the aerospace and aviation electronics operations, and this time potential remedies could not be found. GE walked away from the deal, as senior US officials lashed out at Brussels.Microsoft has faced regulatory problems in several jurisdictions, including the US. But the software group’s tussle with Brussels was particularly tortuous, starting with a complaint lodged by Sun Microsystems in 1998 and effectively only ending last December. During the intervening period, EU officials looked at inter-operability issues – how Microsoft’s products work with those of other companies – and at the “tying” of Windows Media Player and the Internet Explorer browser with the Windows operating system.Brussels’s first investigation led to Microsoft being fined €497m ($671m) for abuse of a dominant position in 2004. But the commission subsequently claimed the software group had failed to comply with its ruling, leading to further fines topping €1bn. These are still under appeal.The subsequent pursuit of claims that the company was illegally bundling its IE browser with Windows had a more constructive outcome. Last year, Microsoft offered to provide PC users with a screen within the Windows software which would allow them to choose between a dozen rival browsers, to be offered in random order.The proposal, which took the form of legally binding commitments formed after input from competing browser companies, was finally accepted by EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in December. The deal is being implemented: Microsoft has been testing the proposal, and could start rolling it out across Europe next week.Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s smaller competitor, first brought a complaint about the world’s biggest chipmaker to Brussels in 2000. After raids in 2005, the commission formally accused Intel in 2008 of trying to do deals with computer manufacturers to push AMD out of the central processing unit business.There were further raids later that year, and the charges were expanded to allege that rebates had also been used illegally to persuade a big electronics retailer to sell Intel-based PCs only. In May last year, Ms Kroes imposed a €1.06bn fine on Intel for abusing its dominant position – the largest single penalty to be levied on any company for antitrust abuses in Europe. Intel is appealing.The EU action followed adverse findings by regulators in Japan and South Korea. But it was only in 2008 that New York’s attorney-general launched an antitrust investigation into the company’s activities, while the Federal Trade Commission finally lodged a complaint – involving allegations which were similar to the EU’s, although broader – last December. Intel, meanwhile, paid a further $1.25bn to settle a private antitrust action lawsuit brought against it by AMD.

With the civilian industry mired in gloom, though, it was the defence contractors who put the sparkle into Asia’s largest show in Singapore this month as they chased up to $100bn in procurement contracts from India.“India has huge potential for us in terms of defence business,” says Christian Duhain, a vice president at EADS. “The demand is huge.”India’s procurement programme is driven by concerns about China and Pakistan, together with growing regional commitments such as a recent defence pact with Qatar, and the need to replace ageing weapons systems, many supplied by the now defunct Soviet Union.However, it is India’s growing economic clout, together with the removal by former president George W Bush of a long-standing US arms embargo, that has turned the country into the most most fiercely contested arms market in Asia.“There are so many projects I find it hard to keep track of it all,” says Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, a former director of operations for the Indian air force who is now director of the Centre for Air Power Studies in New Delhi. “Wherever you look you find that there is just enormous activity going on.”The biggest deal is a tender for 126 multi-role fighter aircraft, worth about $10bn, which is being contested by Boeing’s F/A18 Super Hornet, France’s Dassault Rafale, Lockheed Martin’s F16, Russia’s Mig35, Sweden’s Saab Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a European consortium including EADS.As Boeing’s F16 and other fighters went through their paces overhead, defence executives interviewed at the Singapore show said they expected this turnkey order to be expanded to include a second tranche of 60 aircraft, which could increase its value by up to half.“I think it is probably going to be a programme of about 180 aircraft eventually,” says Mark Kronenberg, Boeing’s vice-president for defence-related international business development. “They haven’t said they are necessarily going to buy the 60, but if you look at the way they lay it out in terms of reducing the number of platforms that’s what makes sense.”Executives say India is also looking for transport aircraft and heavy-lift helicopters for the air force, 197 light helicopters together with infantry systems and howitzers for the army, and a range of submarines, frigates and multi-role helicopters for the navy.KPMG in New Delhi estimates the value of these programmes at about $20bn.A wide range of other contracts are, or may, soon be up for grabs, according to manufacturers. These include airborne tankers, radar systems, air-to-air and anti-tank missiles, encrypted telecoms and border surveillance equipment.India is also refurbishing and upgrading its Mirage 2000 fighter force, and discussing joint development of an advanced fighter with Russia.A range of defence companies is bidding for parts of this business, or is expected to do so, including Sikorsky, Bell, Raytheon and Honeywell of the US, Israel’s Elbit, France’s Thales, Augusta Westland, the Anglo-Italian helicopter maker, Finmeccanica of Italy and Eurocopter, an arm of EADS.Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, which manufactures howitzers and the Leopard II main battle tank, also hopes to sell to in India in the long term.“India is a market that is increasing fast. It has one of the largest populations and one of the largest defence budgets in the world. It is investing so it is one of our key tasks to have a look at India,” says Christian Goettfert, managing director of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann.Analysts said that India will be looking for substantial offsets and joint venture deals for most of the contracts, in line with a government commitment to increase local content, including design, to an eventual target of 100 per cent.Charles Pybus, a defence expert at KPMG in New Delhi, says foreign companies will have to be ready for close co-operation with Indian defence contractors. These include government-owned Hindustan Aeronautics, which makes combat aircraft and helicopters, Larsen & Toubro, which makes missile systems and naval engineering systems, and Mahindra Defence Systems, which manufactures armoured vehicles, weapons systems and ammunition.However, the requirement for joint ventures or offset deals is unlikely to be a disincentive for most manufacturers.“The western defence market is drying up at an alarming rate, while at the same time they have cost pressures which are making them look towards lower cost centres like India anyway,” said Mr Pybus.
201;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-01-30T04:21:17Z;Honeywell maintains conservative outlook;;Honeywell International, the US industrial conglomerate, closed a difficult year with improved fourth-quarter results but maintained a conservative outlook, noting it was prepared for a rapid economic recovery but planning for a much slower rebound.The results and comments echo those of industrial companies such as Tyco, Caterpillar and United Technologies that have seen stabilization in the last quarter but remain cautious on the prospects for the coming year.Such conglomerates expect modest rebounds in sales to benefit the bottom line thanks to aggressive cost cutting in the downturn. But market expectations for a recovery have run ahead and their forecasts have undershot analyst’s consensus estimates.“We are, as usual, planning conservatively in 2010, with modest organic sales growth,” said Dave Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, which makes everything from electronics for fighter jets to home security devices.“While we should all be cautious about the year ahead of us, particularly the first half, I feel good about the investments we have been making.”For the first quarter, Honeywell now expects earnings of between 35 cents and 40 cents per share on revenue of between $7.2bn and $7.6bn. Consensus estimates were for profits of 47 cents per share and revenues of $7.63bn.For the full year, Honeywell reaffirmed its earnings guidance for $2.20 to $2.40 per share due to an 80 cents per share headwind from non-cash charges related to pension accounting but roughly in line with analyst estimates.Honeywell shares fell about 3 per cent per cent to $38.63 in spite of new government data showing that the US economy grew at the fastest rate in six years during the fourth quarter, raising hopes that the recovery is gaining steam.In the fourth quarter net income was roughly flat at $698m, or 91 cents per share, compared to the same period in 2008 on sales down 7 per cent to $8.1bn as airlines bought fewer parts. The results were just ahead of analyst expectations.Overall 2009 was a tough year for Honeywell. In July the company was forced to warn its investors that profits would fall at the low end of the range it had set earlier in the year as the recession squeezed all important divisions.Still, Mr Cote said Honeywell had come through the downturn in good shape. Cost cutting held margins steady despite falling sales and the company preserved its industrial base, developed new products and expanded its emerging market presence.For the full year, net income fell 23 per cent to $2.2bn leading to $2.95 of earnings per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2008. Revenues fell to $30.9bn, down from $36.6bn in 2008, led by 15 per cent declines in its aerospace unit.
202;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2010-01-19T19:44:18Z;Norway fund shuns tobacco companies;;Norway has dropped 17 tobacco companies, including Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, from its sovereign wealth fund, adding to a growing list of stocks blacklisted by Europe’s biggest equity investor.Imperial Tobacco, Altria, Reynolds American and Japan Tobacco were among others barred from the $455bn fund – which owns more than 1 per cent of all global stocks – after the Norwegian finance ministry ruled that the companies were in breach of the fund’s ethical guidelines.The tobacco companies join a list of about 50 stocks excluded from the Norwegian fund on ethical grounds, ranging from arms manufacturers, such as Boeing and BAE Systems, to companies accused of environmental and labour rights violations, including Rio Tinto and Wal-Mart.Norway has sought to make its sovereign wealth fund a role model for socially responsible investment since introducing ethical guidelines in 2003. Tobacco companies initially escaped exclusion but Sigbjørn Johnsen, finance minister, on Tuesday said it was time for them to be removed.“It is important that the ethical guidelines reflect at all times what can be considered to be commonly held values of the owners of the fund,” he said.The fund, in which Norway invests its oil wealth for future generations, is the world’s second-largest sovereign wealth fund after that of the United Arab Emirates.According to Reuters calculations, the fund’s holdings in the 17 excluded tobacco companies were worth NKr14.6bn ($2.6bn) at the end of 2008. Its stakes included 1.3 per cent of British American Tobacco, 0.5 per cent of Philip Morris International and 1.3 per cent of Imperial Tobacco.The finance ministry said all stocks had been sold in advance of Tuesday’s announcement. It added that other companies connected with the industry could be excluded in future.The fund has a Council of Ethics that recommends stocks for removal, with the final decision made by the finance ministry.Norway stirred controversy last September by excluding Elbit Systems, an Israeli company that supplies the surveillance system for the “separation barrier” under construction by Israel in the West Bank.Other blacklisted companies include Honeywell and Northrop Grumman for their role in making nuclear weapons and EADS, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon for production of cluster munitions.
203;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-12-27T21:56:55Z;A decade of ups and downs on the M&A carousel;;"In January 2000, as Steve Case unveiled the all-stock $164bn merger between AOL and Time Warner, the AOL chief executive declared it an historic moment that would transform the competitive landscape of the media business and the way people used the internet forever.A decade later, the “deal of the century” is not only being unwound but is widely castigated as an example of the chief executive hubris that characterised a period when the worldwide value of deals exceeded $3,500bn and bankers briefly gained celebrity status but ended with their reputation in tatters.Daniel Stillit , mergers and acquisitions analyst at UBSsays: “The decade opened at the high point of a merger wave. It’s ending at the low point”.The new millennium began just as the US stock market was wrapping up its fifth consecutive year of double-digit gains and the rapid growth of the technology industry had started to ebb.The urge to merge was driven by globalisation, deregulation, the need to reduce costs and the desire to gain critical mass – not to mention chief executives’ penchant for empire-building. Bigger was not only better, boards felt, but was necessary if companies were to compete and survive on the global stage.With the rise in M&A, came the rise of the M&A bankers. Rainmakers developed star-like status, sporting Italian ties and bespoke suits, and hatching mega-mergers in private jets as they flew to their clients’ winter or summer residences.Such was their success that, by the end of 2000, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch – Wall Street’s three biggest investment banks – had each advised on deals with a combined value of more than $1,000bn.Corporate Europe was also restructuring. The introduction of the euro in 1999 and the creation of a single capital market triggered the biggest hostile deal to date: Vodafone’s $172bn takeover of Mannesmann.That same year, Vivendi launched an audacious $34bn acquisition of Universal Music of the US. European chief executives had finally joined the globalisation game.Henrik Aslaksen, global head of M&A at Deutsche Bank says: “The US had been the elephant of dealmaking for more than 20 years. Then Europe started to catch up and slowly corporates started to be transformed through consolidation”.Utilities and energy took centre-stage. Under pressure from the European Commission for more liberalisation and integration of national markets, and with competition between countries for scarce energy resources intensifying, the European Union’s energy market spent the next few years consolidating.Over the next eight years, Eon – formed in 1999 by the merger of German utilities Veba and Viag – would buy Powergen of the UK; Iberdrola of Spain would acquire Scottish Power; and Gaz de France and Suez would strike a $70bn merger deal.Politics, however, not profit, was the driving force. William Vereker, Nomura’s head of investment banking for Europe, Middle East and Africa, says: “The wave of consolidation in the utility sector in Europe through the decade was driven as much by a political imperative to create strong national champions as by any sound industrial logic”.By the third quarter of 2000, however, worldwide dealmaking had started to slow.Investors began to cool towards outbound cross-border mergers. By October, the euro had fallen in value15 per cent against sterling and 25 per cent against the dollar from its launch, while in the US, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index tumbled 39 per cent from its March high.The market’s love affair with media and technology companies was over. Investors struggled to value new-fangled deals, and as interest rates began to climb, M&A activity took on a more sober mantle, shifting from new economy clicks to old economy bricks.During the last four months of 2000, General Electric launched a $45bn bid for Honeywell International; Weyerhaeuser acquired Willamette Industries for $5.3bn and Unilever made an unsolicited $21.3bn cash offer to buy Bestfoods.The end of 2000 also saw a rise in financial services mergers as the industry took advantage of the dismantling of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall laws a year earlier that had kept banking, insurance, and securities businesses separate. UBS hooked up with PaineWebber; Credit Suisse bagged Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and Chase Manhattan took over JPMorgan. Equipped with stronger balance sheets, the banks were now ready to embark on the next cycle of dealmaking. But they would have to wait.Falling share prices globally and worries about an economic slowdown in the US had made chief executives wary of launching bids.By the first quarter of 2001, the volume of M&A activity worldwide had reached $390bn, about a third of the volume during the same period a year earlier. However, there were still significant deals in the pipeline and on September 3 2001, Hewlett-Packard surprised the market with a $25bn all-paper bid for Compaq. The transaction was meant to signal a new type of technology deal with real cost savings to be made.But Wall Street did not buy the story and investors sent Hewlett-Packard’s shares down by 19 per cent on the day the deal was unveiled.The timing could not have been worse. Just eight days later, the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center sent the world reeling.The US equity markets closed for four days to allow central banks the chance to inject liquidity into financial systems around the world and companies, concerned over the economic fallout from the terrorist attacks, cancelled planned acquisitions, while others reviewed their expansion, sale or flotation plans.The collapse of Enron, the US energy trader, in late November did little to help chief executives’ already damaged confidence.They hunkered down to repair their over-leveraged balance sheets, while banks, in an effort to cut their bloated cost bases, embarked on the most savage cost-cutting exercise seen since 1974 and the Middle East oil crisis.Frank Aquila, M&A partner at US law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, says: “Dealmaking came to a screeching halt in late 2001 and stayed that way through 2003.“The high-profile corporate scandals, coupled with a weak global economy, froze both strategic and financial buyers. There was little appetite for deals as executives grappled with potential scandals, new regulations and a difficult economic environment.”By the start of 2002, weak corporate earnings, falling shares and economic uncertainty across the globe were all weighing on the M&A market.But the dealmaking baton was about to pass from strategic bidders to the new breed of private equity groups. These had spent most of the merger boom on the sidelines unable to compete with their strategic rivals’ flaunting of their highly inflated stock as acquisition currency.Armed with about $100bn in newly-raised funds which could be leveraged to more than $300bn with cheap debt – as interest rates had fallen due to the large liquidity injections by central banks post September 11 – buy-out groups sifted through the rubble of the downturn for cut-price assets.There were plenty to choose from. Debt-laden companies, US and European conglomerates and public companies unable to raise money from depressed equity markets were all keen to offload underperforming subsidiaries.Private equity groups were particularly attracted to companies with apparently steady cash flows, such as Yell, the directories business that BT eventually sold to KKR.The US buy-out group also acquired Legrand, the French electricals business, for $5bn from Schneider Electric; while Madison Dearborn took private Jefferson Smurfit, the paper and packaging business, in a £3.4bn ($5.4bn) deal.It did not take long for confidence to return to boardrooms as economic indicators started to suggest the downturn would be shallow and brief. By the second half of 2002, companies were striking deals again.In July, Pfizer kicked off the action with a $61bn acquisition of Pharmacia, followed a few months later by Cadbury Schweppes (which snapped up Pfizer’s Adams candy unit for $4.2bn in cash) and Wrigley, which launched an aggressive bid to acquire Hershey for $12.5bn after the charitable trust that controls the US chocolate group ordered it to explore a sale.The deal fell apart in the face of fierce local opposition to the sale and ended with the resignation of 10 board members from the trust, but it did not stop the year 2002 ending with a deal which would resonate over the remainder of the decade: HSBC’s $16bn acquisition of Household International, the US’s biggest subprime mortgage lender.Six years later, at the height of the global banking crisis, HSBC would write off $10.6bn of the goodwill on its balance sheet associated with the acquisition.By 2003, private equity groups were starting to make an even bigger splash as they went shopping for high-profile bargains on the British high street, attracted by the low valuations and property assets which could be used to raise cash.The abundance of cheap debt meant buy-out groups could target increasingly large targets.Towards the end of 2004, Philip Green, the British retail billionaire had little trouble raising £7.5bn in debt from five banks to try to buy Marks and Spencer. The attempt failed, but the sheer size of the target and the debt levels involved astonished the market.Dominic Murphy, a partner at KKR, says: “European private equity came of age during this decade and became a mainstream part of M&A activity The industry is now seen as a mature and sophisticated asset class,”.By 2006, it appeared that no public company was off limits. To increase their firepower, buy-out groups clubbed together and KKR finally succeeded in breaking its own record $31bn purchase of RJR Nabisco in 1989 – until then the biggest leveraged buy-out – when it led the $33bn buy-out of HCA, a US hospital group.The debt binge, though, would eventually see private equity groups saddled with $400bn of debt which would need to be repaid between 2012 and 2014, according to data from S&P LCD. Their strategic counterparts, on the other hand, appeared to have learnt the lessons of the 1990s merger boom and were putting together more sensible combinations with industrial logic such as Tata Steel’s $13.4bn takeover of the UK’s Corus in 2007 and Japan Tobacco’s $7.5bn acquisition of its British rival Gallaher that same year.Many of those deals highlighted the increasing role of emerging market players in the global merger game. Between 2007 and 2008, the six big emerging economies enjoyed a 30 per cent rise in outbound global M&A, according to Dealogic.Mr Aquila says: “In the middle of the decade strategic buyers sought to expand their geographic footprint and increase shareholder value through deals that permitted the extraction of significant synergies.Less exciting than the go-go deals earlier in the decade, these deals have generally [been] shown to have created value,”The rise in global equity markets had also brought out the corporate raiders, and companies around the world suddenly found themselves in fear of finding activist shareholders on their share registers.Time Warner, McDonald’s, Heinz, Tyco and The New York Times were just some of the names that were targeted by hedge fund and other activists seeking corporate change.The most dramatic example was the rebellion of Deutsche Börse’s shareholders in 2005, who blocked its proposed acquisition of the London Stock Exchange and ousted its chairman and chief executive.But the most memorable was the battle for control of ABN Amro, which was triggered by a letter to the Dutch bank from The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, which demanded ABN either find a buyer or break itself up.The result was that, at the peak of the bull market in May 2007, Royal Bank of Scotland teamed up with Fortis and Santander to launch a €71bn hostile bid for ABN.It was a deal that would bring RBS to its knees and become a symbol of the credit crisis, with Fred Goodwin, the bank’s chief executive, blamed for his role in leading the UK into economic disaster.By the summer of 2007, the first signs of the subprime crisis started to appear. An early warning of the impending tightening came when KKR failed to syndicate $10bn in debt to finance its buy-out of Alliance Boots – a deal now seen as marking the peak of the buy-out boom.On September 15, Lehman Brothers collapsed in the world’s biggest bankruptcy. As banks around the world struggled to issue debt, several emergency rescue mergers were struck: Bank of America spent $44.4bn on Merrill Lynch. In the UK, Lloyds TSB put down $21.9bn to take over HBOS. And, ending RBS’s dream of becoming one of the world’s most powerful institutions, the British government took control of 70 per cent of the bank.The repercussions of the crisis quickly spread to M&A. Companies in the process of doing deals put their plans on ice, paralysed by fears over refinancing. As ore prices fell, BHP withdrew its $146bn bid for Rio Tinto, which, in need of cash to pay down the debt it had accumulated from its bull-market acquisition of Alcan, turned to China’s state-owned Chinalco for $19.5bn in aid.Nationalist opposition in Australia and shareholder fury in the UK forced Rio to abandon that deal and return to BHP, and the two miners finally agreed a joint venture in iron ore.By the end of 2008, the dollar value of cancelled deals for the final quarter stood at about $322bn, almost matching the $362bn value of deals actually completed.But the slump in dealmaking did not prevent a burst of activity in the healthcare sector at the start of the new year. Three large pharma deals valued at $121bn were agreed, including Pfizer’s takeover of Wyeth and Schering-Plough’s acquisition of Merck, as companies tried to address the issue of losing an estimated $100bn in sales over the next five years as blockbuster patents expire and drug pipelines come under threat from generic rivals.Bankers hoped the rash of activity in the healthcare sector would give companies in other industries the confidence to do deals.The bond markets were open for financing, allowing companies to bypass expensive bank debt and tap investors directly for funds.Sure enough, the rally in equity markets which started in March 2009 and was sustained for the rest of the year, gave some chief executives that courage. Walt Disney splashed out $4bn to buy Marvel Entertainment; Comcast agreed a complex deal with General Electric to take control of NBC Universal and Kraft launched a $16bn hostile bid for Cadbury.Even private equity was back with CVC Capital Partners engineering a $4.4bn buy-out of iShares, Barclays’ exchange-traded fund business.Overall, however, deal activity is still stuck in the post-banking crisis malaise. The pace of global takeovers is about 60 per cent below its $3,200bn peak of 2007 and few bankers are predicting a quick upsurge in volumes.The first six months of next year will set the tone for the next M&A cycle, which bankers insist will be different.But one thing is for sure: as with previous booms, signature deals will come to epitomise its excesses."
204;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-12-16T22:56:54Z;White House plans green tax break extension;;The Obama administration on Wednesday announced plans to extend tax breaks for clean energy investment by $5bn, hoping to simultaneously create jobs and increase the use of renewable energy.The proposal, which has to be approved by Congress, would allow new or expanded manufacturers of technology such as solar panels and wind turbines to receive a 30 per cent tax credit.“We have to jumpstart growth in green manufacturing – and part of that is encouraging companies to build the components of green technology right here on American soil,” Joe Biden, vice president, said when announcing the initiative.The $787bn economic stimulus package included a $2.3bn tax credit to support an additional $5.4bn in private capital investment in green technologies, which Mr Biden described as an “overwhelming success”.Mr Biden announced the extension of the tax credit after talks at the White House on Wednesday with the heads of manufacturers including Dow Corning, Honeywell, Procter and Gamble, Harley-Davidson and Goodyear Tire.The tax credit applied to the building and equipping of new, expanded, or re-tooled factories that manufacture the products needed to power the green economy, the White House said.The programme would cover technologies including wind, solar, batteries, energy efficiency, advanced transportation, and advanced energy transmission, it said.With the unemployment rate still at 10 per cent and the jobs market lagging the economic recovery, the administration is ploughing increasing effort into creating green jobs.President Barack Obama championed clean energy technologies at an employment summit at the White House last week and at a Home Depot store in Virginia on Tuesday, he called for tax incentives for homeowners who make their houses more energy efficient.“The simple act of retrofitting these buildings to make them more energy-efficient… is one of the fastest, easiest and cheapest things we can do to put Americans back to work while saving families money and reducing harmful emissions,” Mr Obama said on Tuesday.The programme is popularly called “cash for caulkers” after the popular “cash for clunkers” car subsidies offered over the summer.
205;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-12-07T17:11:11Z;My indecision is final;;"Last week, Barack Obama, US president, made a decision about US military policy in Afghanistan. Some have said that it took over three months for the commander-in-chief to ratify a decision he had already taken back in March. For observers, this was an acute case study of the tension between two conflicting leadership traits: deliberation and decisiveness.Mr Obama was elected last November in part because he is a clearly a thoughtful man who never knowingly shoots from the hip. On the other hand, there are those who prefer their leaders to tackle the tough decisions and move on, particularly in a military context.Faced with a choice of two attractive qualities – deliberation and decisiveness – perhaps only the truly great leader knows which approach to take and when. However, the bias in American politics and business leadership is often towards decisiveness.President Teddy Roosevelt said: “In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.” In the business world, Larry Bossidy, the former chairman of Honeywell, and Ram Charan noted in their influential book, Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done: “Decisiveness is the ability to make difficult decisions swiftly and well, and act on them. Organisations are filled with people who dance around decisions without ever making them.”However, the issue is not black and white. As a website set up to develop project managers who work for the US federal government notes: “Decisiveness, that ability to make quick and unambiguous decisions, is a trait often associated with great leaders, especially great military leaders. But how does that kind of decision-making fit into the demands of modern program management and when is a more deliberate, data-driven approach called for? What is your decision-making style and how do you adjust it to situational demands?”These are the questions that the project-manager-in-chief must now answer. The danger for President Obama is that by revisiting and then delaying a key decision on Afghanistan, he may have both diminished his prestige and reduced his room for manoeuvre in future critical decision-making situations.Why might his reputation suffer? As Robert Kaplan noted in The Atlantic last month: “The Democrats, for their part, are often accused of being wobbly on national security, lacking both toughness and gumption. Unfortunately, President Barack Obama’s recent handling of the war in Afghanistan plays to those charges.”A president that prioritised the Afghan war during the election campaign, determined on a counter-insurgency strategy and chose a general to execute it in the spring, then balked at the general’s recommendations and reopened the strategy for review throughout the autumn is encouraging his political enemies to paint the Democrats as the party of President Carter and Senator McGovern. Even if the final decision looked more like Henry “Scoop” Jackson, the Cold War anti-communist Democrat.The president’s predicament was outlined by FT columnist Philip Stephens last November: “One of Mr Obama’s most dangerous enemies will be the impatience of our age: the ever present demands that tomorrow’s problems be fixed yesterday. Perhaps the new president will lack the decisiveness that is an essential partner to careful deliberation.”Ten months later, Daniel Dombey, another FT correspondent, wrote an article headlined, “President procrastinator” in which he noted: “From the deserts and mountains of Afghanistan to the nuclear laboratories of Iran and the lands fought over by Arabs and Israelis, the world is waiting for Barack Obama to make up his mind.”Knowing that the White House had announced that the president would arrive at a conclusion to his deliberations after Thanksgiving, did not stop Bob Ainsworth, the UK Defence Secretary, pointing out the problems that prolonged deliberation had on the British.Mr Ainsworth told the Defence Committee that: “We have had a period of hiatus while McChrystal’s plan and his requested uplift has been looked at in the detail to which it has been looked at over a period of some months, and we have had the Afghan elections, which have been far from perfect let us say. All of those things have mitigated against our ability to show progress . . . when we are suffering the kind of losses that we are.”The president justified his review last Tuesday: “There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010, so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period. Instead, the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions, and to explore all the different options, along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and our key partners. And given the stakes involved, I owed the American people – and our troops – no less.”In a 2008 paper on “Decisiveness”, Junichiro Ishida of the Osaka School of International Public Policy, wrote: “An organization led by a decisive leader can seize the moment and change the course of action in a timely fashion, whereas an organization led by an indecisive leader often waits too long, requires unrealistically strong evidence before it changes the course of action, and as a consequence excessively adheres to the status quo.”This is an intriguing predictor for what happened to the president’s policy on Afghanistan as the final decision ended up being a continuation of the surge that had already been agreed when General McChrystal was appointed to lead it.Maureen Dowd noted in the New York Times last month: “The president should get credit for standing back and studying the issue, and for not rubber-stamping the generals’ predictable urge to surge. But the way he has handled the perception part has allowed critics – including generals – to cast him as indecisive.”The deliberation or indecision on Afghanistan may finally have ended but the damage to Mr Obama’s reputation may take longer to mend.The writer is a partner at Tapestry Networks

206;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-11-23T22:06:09Z;The corporate diplomats;;"Nani Beccalli calls himself the “foreign minister of GE”. In his role as chief executive of General Electric International, the Italian is in charge of the entire world outside the US for the conglomerate.Asked if his worldwide domain makes him a potential rival for Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, Mr Beccalli extends the diplomat metaphor further. “I don’t run any operations. I am the Hillary Clinton of the situation,” he says. “I don’t think Hillary Clinton is a threat to [Barack] Obama. It is like in the Iraq war: I am Colin Powell, the people running the war – running our operations – are [Donald] Rumsfeld.”Mr Beccalli is one of a select but growing group of executives who run their companies’ activities in the world outside North America. Jean-Philippe Courtois is another. The Frenchman looks after “230 countries outside two tiny countries, the US and Canada”, he says, in his role as president of Microsoft International.Goldman Sachs has an international arm run out of London by co-chief executives Richard Gnodde and Michael Sherwood, but its geographical remit is more complicated than Microsoft’s and GE’s and does not cover the whole word.General Motors is another US business with an international head – in this case, Nick Reilly, who has just added Opel, its German arm, to his responsibilities.Their roles all vary. Mr Reilly, for example, is involved in operations – unlike Mr Beccalli and Mr Courtois.The position is created mostly by US rather than European companies. At heart, the various versions share the idea of connecting the company to the rest of the world outside the US and providing an advocate for international growth among senior executives. However, the roles, with their immense geographical spread, also bring big challenges, from internal politics to dealing with a bewildering range of governments and cultures.Some people, such as Klaus Kleinfeld, the German-born head of Alcoa, the US aluminium company, are sceptical about the very idea of an international head. “It is a very odd, American concept. If you really want to be international it has to be in your culture,” he says, rather than being imposed by having a set role for it.However, it hardly seems surprising that Microsoft and GE have ap­pointed such executives – both based in Europe – given that each company ran into problems with European regulators earlier this decade.Mr Courtois cites the European Union’s investigation of Microsoft when asked about challenges in the job: “There was clearly a time to really get the company to invest in a responsible way in Europe,” he says. Relations have improved to the point where Mr Courtois was named by the European Commission as an amb­assador for its year of innovation and creativity this year, which means he shared a podium with politicians who had previously bashed the company.GE also reacted to pressure from the EU after the debacle of its blocked bid for Honeywell. When Mr Beccalli took the job in 2001, he moved the international headquarters from London to Brussels. He is not involved directly in any of GE’s operations but focuses instead on the US group’s worldwide strategy and on engaging with any grouping that has influence over the company.Increasingly, that means being close to governments and regulators. “The government is going to be the major player in this economic cycle,” Mr Beccalli says. In the past year, GE has started an initiative to work more closely with governments, a move that grew out of looking at how it could get business from stimulus pack­ages. But the interest in governments is not limited to just selling to them. Mr Beccalli also says it is about helping shape policies, and public advocacy for GE.He adds: “Who is spending the money? Guess what? The central government has no money. The things are procured at the regional and city level. So Boris [Johnson, London mayor], not just Gordon [Brown, UK prime minister].”That implies a lot of travelling. Mr Courtois reckons he spends 60 per cent of his time travelling and visits up to 40 countries a year. Mr Beccalli says he is on the road 70-80 per cent of the time: “It is important bec­ause I could not talk to my colleagues about Kaz­akh­stan if I hadn’t been there and smelled the air.”When he spoke to the Financial Times, he was preparing to fly to Athens to meet Mr Immelt so they could travel tog­ether to Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Jakarta and New Delhi to meet prime ministers and other politicians.How do they monitor all the countries reporting to them? At Microsoft, the world is divided into 13 areas, 11 of which report to Mr Courtois. Every quarter he spends three hours per area going through problems and opportunities.Every five weeks, Mr Beccalli conducts a two-day operational review, covering Asia and the Middle East on the first day, and Europe and the Americas on the second. That enables him to be a bridge between headquarters and the countries.“I am selling the company in the regions and I am selling the regions in the company,” he says, before adding: “Sometimes the internal sell is more difficult than the external one.”As an example, Mr Beccalli points to a Scandinavian executive who had to make the case repeatedly for being in offshore wind until, finally, GE two months ago sealed the takeover of Scan Wind of Norway.Likewise, Mr Beccalli identifies as one of his biggest challenges his first trip to the Middle East soon after starting the job in 2002. He returned convinced that business opportunities existed, including for healthcare manufacturing in Saudi Arabia.But so soon after the September 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, many at GE were sceptical. “It took me a lot of time to convince the corporation it was an opportunity,” he adds.To an outsider, the possibility of conflict with the group chief executive seems big given that the two executives essentially run the world. However, both Mr Beccalli and Mr Courtois say their status as company veterans who have had a number of roles helps them avoid problems.Mr Courtois was Microsoft’s 11th employee in France and only the 400th in the world; now, there are 92,000. “When you have been around for 25 years you know a lot of people …When Steve [Ballmer, chief executive] visits some countries, such as the UK and France, I would be with him,” says Paris-based Mr Courtois.Mr Beccalli points to the fact that, of 42 people on the executive committee at one stage, 17 had come through the relatively small plastics unit.The comments of both suggest that outsiders would struggle in such jobs.Their nationalities may help too. When asked if he must perform the role of diplomat inside GE, Mr Beccalli says immodestly: “I’m Italian. All the greatest diplomats are Italian.”"
207;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-11-23T16:31:31Z;Aviation: Advances in air control will cut emissions;;Stay glued to the window of any jet flying along the world’s established routes and you will notice airfields slipping under the aircraft’s aluminium belly at rather frequent intervals.This is not just to give the best chance of getting the jet back on the ground safely if anything goes wrong at 35,000ft. It is also a legacy of the fact that management of air traffic has been only incrementally improved in decades.Moves are under way, however, to improve on radar-based air traffic control – which is also now blamed for wasting fuel, generating unnecessary pollution and causing congestion and delays.Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) systems, under which aircraft generate and transmit their own highly accurate position information, are being introduced to manage expected large long-term rises in traffic.The systems will, it is claimed, allow more direct routing, let aircraft spend more time at high altitudes where their engines work most efficiently, and reduce noise around airports.“It’s one of those rare win-win scenarios,” says Bob Smith, chief technical officer of Honeywell, the avionics equipment maker. “Airlines win on costs, the public on safety, and avionics makers get to benefit from sales.”The routes that most big aircraft currently fly owe more to pioneer aviators than to modern technology. Some in the US are the same as were originally marked out by beacons lit for the pilots of primitive mailplanes.As technology advanced, lights were replaced by radio beacons, and a network of airways grew up, stringing together airports and transmitters in a web of short straight lines.The radar systems that air traffic control depends on to keep aircraft apart in these airways are costly to maintain, and give a picture which may be as much as 12 seconds out of date – because of the time the dishes take to sweep a full circle.Aircraft in controlled airspace have to carry transponders – which tell the radar system who they are and how high they are.ADS-B systems take that further. They use transponders that broadcast the position of the aircraft, using information derived from accurate sources including global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) such as the US Global Positioning System. Automatic broadcasts every second can be received not only by air traffic control ground stations but also but also by other aircraft.With certainty about where each aircraft is, comes the potential to have them fly closer to each other – but in greater safety than now.This frees aircraft from the airways network and allows them to fly directly from point to point, with potential traffic conflicts being flagged early enough for safe avoiding action.Aircraft surface movements can be made more efficient too. So a jet can push back from the terminal at exactly the right time to taxi uninterrupted to the runway for take-off. Atlanta airport in the US found introducing such a system trimmed $34m from total fuel costs, and saving aircraft operators $108m last year, according to the US Federal Aviation Authority.Landing aircraft can be sequenced more effectively, and can stay at fuel-efficient altitudes until a point where they can throttle back and almost glide down to the runway – cutting noise around airports as well as fuel use.Mr Smith quotes a study showing that switching all traffic into Los Angeles International airport from stepped descents would cut fuel burn by 30 per cent, which in turn would mean 30 per cent less CO2 and 40 per cent less nitrous oxides.In the US, the FAA is replacing its current system, based on radar and voice communication between pilots and air traffic controllers, with the Next Generation Air Transportation System, which relies heavily on ADS-B. The cost to upgrade is $2.5bn, but the new system should cut maintenance bills from $150m to $30m a year.Completion of NextGen is scheduled for 2025, but much work has already been done. ITT won the $1.8bn contract to build by 2013 and operate the 793 ground stations that will receive and relay broadcasts from aircraft, and feed weather and traffic control information to them by the same datalink.The FAA’s implementation plan published last month says: “Total flight delays will be reduced by 35-40 per cent, saving almost 1bn gallons of fuel.”Europe is studying a €30bn ($45bn) overhaul of air traffic control that could yield fuel consumption gains of 10 per cent a flight. A draft regulation would require large and fast aircraft to have ADS-B capability by 2015.John Law, surveillance programmes manager at Eurocontrol, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation, is enthusiastic about the potential for cost savings “by taking out one or more radar layers. In some areas, we have quadruple coverage”.However, recent investment in radar systems by some European countries, means existing systems may remain for some time, the International Civil Aviation Organisation points out.Early ADS-B adopters include Sweden, the north of Canada and part of China. Australia has set the end of 2013 as a deadline for ADS-B compliance.Before operators can access potential gains, though, they must spend on avionics. The cost to Southwest Airlines of upgrading its fleet is $175m, according to the FAA. But the airline will cut its fuel use and reduce carbon emissions by 150,000 tonnes a year.Despite contributing only 2-3 per cent of manmade greenhouse gases, aviation is under pressure to act. ADS-B, says Honeywell’s Mr Smith, offers the most efficient use of airspace.
208;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-11-15T17:58:10Z;Oracle v Brussels;;The mere possibility that a $7.4bn technology merger in California might be blocked by regulators nearly half the world away over a fly-speck of a business shows how odd the dispute over Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems has become.At the centre of this dispute is an open-source software unit of Sun that has annual revenues of only $70m. According to European regulators, in an official complaint issued last week, Oracle’s assumption of the MySQL software could thwart competition for its own, far larger database business. The US Department of Justice, in a clear rebuke to Brussels, pointed out that it had found no problems with the transaction.Given the nature of open source software, the numbers don’t tell the full story about the significance of MySQL. Nevertheless, they still make the point eloquently that this is a side-issue that should never have been allowed to threaten a far bigger deal, let alone stir up regulatory differences across the Atlantic.Both sides have stumbled into this disagreement by accident. Having already won clearance in Washington, Oracle tried to rush its deal through in Brussels without showing due deference to regulators there, and has paid the price. But in asserting its right to form its own view, the European Commission is now in danger of over-reach. There is still time to overcome this stand-off and a compromise is still the most likely outcome, but it will require a greater willingness on both sides to give ground than has so far been the case.Thankfully, this is not a symptom of deeper transatlantic policy differences. Since the row that followed Europe’s blocking of General Electric’s proposed acquisition of Honeywell eight years ago, regulators in the US and Europe have aligned their work on merger approvals more closely. For businesses, this has lessened the risk that different standards will be applied to international mergers.In other areas, however, Washington’s decision to soft-pedal on anti-trust issues during the Bush years meant that regulators elsewhere were left to take up important battles. Most notable have been the actions in Europe and Asia against Microsoft and Intel.So it is a welcome sign that US regulators, under a new administration, are showing a greater interest in anti-trust enforcement again. Achieving consistency in enforcement between different jurisdictions is as important as achieving consistency in policy.
209;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-11-03T23:46:32Z;Oracle braced for EU objection on Sun deal;;Oracle is braced for a formal objection from Brussels to its planned $7.4bn acquisition of fellow US technology company Sun Microsystems, escalating the company’s legal wrangle with Europe’s competition authorities.The US software company has refused to offer any concessions to European regulators to meet their concerns about the deal, according to one person close to the process. That has left Brussels close to issuing an official statement of objections, the first step on the path to blocking it, this person added.The complaint could come within days, but there is still a chance that one side or the other will back down, according to observers in Brussels. Neither side commented on Tuesday.Some suggest that Oracle has little to lose by waiting to see Brussels’ precise concerns. It would then still have time to offer concessions or try to mount a legal fight, though this would inevitably be prolonged.The European Commission last blocked a US merger when it intervened in General Electric’s proposed purchase of Honeywell in 2001, causing a transatlantic row.Since then, regulators in Washington and Brussels have tried to co-ordinate their work more closely to avoid such disagreements.The Commission rarely blocks deals outright. Between 1994 and 2003, the European commission blocked 21 mergers out of the 2,157 notified – an average rate of 1 per cent a year. Between 2004 and 2008, only two of the 1,665 deals notified have been barred.The Sun acquisition has already been cleared by the US Department of Justice, in spite of the agency’s heightened attention under the Obama administration to antitrust issues, particularly in the technology industry.Brussels has blocked only two proposed mergers since 2004, both of them involving European companies.The EC first raised its concerns about the Sun acquisition two months ago, preventing Oracle from completing the deal. Since then Sun has said it will lay off 3,000 people, attributing the timing of that decision to the delay in Brussels.The commission had no comment on Tuesday. But two weeks ago, commission officials confirmed that, in spite of ”repeated requests”, Oracle had neither provided them with evidence that the deal would not cause competition problems, nor discussed possible remedies.With Sun’s sales under severe pressure due to the recession and the uncertainty about its future, people familiar with the state of its business have warned that longer delays could seriously jeopardise its survival.Brussels’ concerns centre on Oracle’s assumption of MySQL, an open source software company that Sun acquired in 2008. Opponents of the deal claim MySQL could become a serious competitor to Oracle’s own core business in the long term.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s outspoken chief executive officer, has challenged antitrust regulators in the past, having won a rare legal battle against the justice department’s attempt to block his purchase of PeopleSoft.He said recently that Sun was losing $100m a month as Oracle waited for approval of the deal.
210;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Qinetiq chief to depart in shake-up;;Shares in Qinetiq rose almost 16 per cent on Thursday after Graham Love said he would stand down as chief executive, removing one of the last members of the team behind the controversial privatisation of the former defence research laboratory.Mr Love will be replaced by Leo Quinn, former head of bank-note maker De La Rue, from the end of November. Mr Quinn has experience with turnrounds from his time at Honeywell International, Qinetiq said.The news was broadly welcomed by analysts. Mr Quinn “is highly regarded in the City,” said Chris Dyett of Investec, adding that the move was part of a broader effort to “freshen up” the management.Qinetiq appointed a new financial officer in August 2008 and this year said Sir John Chisholm, chairman, would leave in 2010.Qinetiq said the leadership change had been planned for almost a year, but it comes at a sensitive time for the group.On Wednesday an independent inquiry into the 2006 Nimrod disaster savaged the company for its role in preparing a flawed safety review of the aircraft a year before it exploded above Afghanistan.Qinetiq said it was considering the report’s conclusions but it was too soon to comment in detail.At the same time, the company is struggling to cut costs at its European businesses amid a dip in research spending by the Ministry of Defence, its main customer, though its US business is growing.Mr Love has been a contentious figure both inside the company and with the broader market. As the chief financial officer of the former government research and testing company he made a fortune when it was privatised between 2003 and 2006.The stock has fared less well, dropping from a high of 228¼p in September 2008 to Thursday’s close of 165.4p. Earlier in the year the company had to stave off the threat of strike action from employees upset at pay freezes.During his time at Qinetiq, Mr Love was responsible for the company’s rapid expansion in the US, through acquisitions such as Foster Miller, the robot maker, in 2004.

212;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-10-23T20:56:51Z;Wall St slips after early surge;;"The positive tone in US equities fizzled out on Friday in spite of a
robust start to the end of the week from stronger earnings from Microsoft and a surge in Amazon shares to record highs.The technology sector clung to gains for a little longer than other indices.However, by the market’s close on Friday, the main indices were all down. The S&P 500 index closed down 1.2 per cent to 1,079.6. For the week, the index has fallen just over 0.7 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below the 10,000 mark, losing 0.2 per cent on the week to close at 9,972.2. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent at 2,154.5, down 0.1 per cent for the week.The negative tone prevailed in spite of positive economic data and as more companies beat earnings expectations. Sales of existing US homes climbed in September to the highest level in more than two years.“The economic fundamentals are improving faster than anyone can get their head around,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Well Capital Management, who is bullish on the stock market’s prospects.He said the fact that so many traders and investors did not believe that the economic recovery was “real” meant that the stock market continued to retreat after every shift higher. The 1,100 level for the S&P 500 provided particularly strong resistance.Indeed, the index briefly touched a new high for the year this week at 1,101.4 before retreating.The most stellar performer on Friday was Amazon. On Thursday, the world’s largest online retailer posted quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates and gave an upbeat forecast for holiday sales.The information sent Amazon’s shares to a new all-time high. They closed up 26.8 per cent at $118.5.Also boosting the technology sector was Microsoft, the second-biggest company in the S&P 500, after it earned 40 cents per share in its fiscal first quarter compared with average forecasts of 32 cents per share. Microsoft’s shares were up 5.4 per cent to $28.The S&P information and technology sector – the largest in the index – was down 0.3 per cent on the day. On the week, it notched up gains of 1 per cent.The financials sector, which made sharp gains on Thursday following stronger-than-expected earnings, eased again on Friday and traded down 1.6 per cent. It ended the week 0.8 per cent lower. T Rowe Price, the fund management group, saw a 10.5 per cent surge in its share price after investors made the biggest fund deposits since the second quarter of 2008 and earnings beat Wall Street estimates. It finished the week at $54.27.Another strong finance group was Legg Mason, up 3.9 per cent at $31.90.On the downside, earnings from Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railroad company, disappointed, and the shares were 6.5 per cent lower at $79.10, dragging the transport sector lower.There were significant drops in energy, reflecting concerns about the direction of oil prices. The sector fell 2 per cent on Friday, notching up a fall of more than 1 per cent on the week. ExxonMobil, the largest oil company and biggest stock in the S&P 500, was down 1.2 per cent to $73.57.Honeywell International, the US manufacturing company, also reported better-than-expected earnings . The group, which makes cockpit electronics, saw its shares fall 0.7 per cent to $38.26.Tom Lee, chief US equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said the S&P 500 was struggling to push above the 1,100 level. He said he remained “constructive”. Of the 174 companies in the S&P 500 index that had reported earnings by Thursday, 28 per cent had set a record for the quarter.“This is astounding considering we are only just emerging from recession,” he said."
213;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Cost cuts boost Honeywell;;Honeywell International drew on cost cuts to help lift its quarterly net income above Wall Street’s expectations despite muted demand at all four of the conglomerate’s businesses.The results echo those of General Electric, United Technologies and other US industrial powerhouses that have turned to sweeping expense reductions in the past year to confront the global economic downturn. But like its peers, Honeywell gave investors little reason to believe a recovery is underway.“While the top-line environment continues to be challenging, we’re able to deliver these results because of the strong growth initiatives and aggressive cost actions we have in place throughout Honeywell, and as evidenced by our ability to preserve and grow margins,” Dave Cote, the company’s chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts.Honeywell’s sales fell 17 per cent to $7.7bn in the third quarter. On the call, David Anderson, the company’s chief financial officer, predicted that revenue would be “flattish” next year.“While the cost saves were good and the third quarter was solid, the 2010 outlook should be viewed as a disappointment to a stubbornly bullish consensus,” Stephen Tusa, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients.Honeywell’s shares were unchanged at $38.53 in midday trading in New York. They have climbed 17 per cent this year.The New Jersey-based company’s net income fell 15 per cent to $608m, or 80 cents a share, in the third quarter from $719m, or 97 cents, a year earlier.Total cost declined 16 per cent to $6.9bn.Honeywell’s aerospace division earned $455m, a 12 per cent drop from a year ago, on sales of $2.6bn.Operating profit at the automation and control solutions unit totalled $431m, little-changed from a year earlier. Sales fell to $3.2bn.The specialty materials business earned $155m, a 2 per cent decline, as revenue fell 23 per cent to $1.3bn.Transportation systems reported a $62m profit, down 39 per cent, as sales fell to $875m.
214;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-10-19T15:41:16Z;Sudden dive shows signs of flattening;;"As the financial crisis stabilises and hopes of economic recovery grow around the world, there are signs that the slump in the business aviation industry may be finally easing.The leading indicators that the battered sector has been monitoring anxiously over the past year have begun to look more hopeful – or not so dire.No longer does every month bring evidence of yet another increase in the burgeoning number of used business jets for sale. That in turn means plummeting aircraft prices are showing signs of stabilising. The monthly falls in flight activity have slowed in some markets.A number of manufacturers say they are starting to see purchase inquiries again.In addition, the intense political backlash against the use of corporate jets has abated, following intense public relations efforts in Washington by the industry.After one of the most painful periods in the industry’s history, however, none of this translates into a return to normality.As Richard Aboulafia, vice-president for analysis at the Teal Group aerospace consultancy in Virginia, puts it: “We’re not falling. That’s not the same as recovery.”Indeed, many leading industry figures remain unsure that the industry has finally bottomed out.“We’re hoping we’ve found the bottom but you never know,” says Pete Bunce, president and chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (Gama).“We think we have from the indicators, but there’s always a danger the economy could stagnate or some other secondary crisis could come up.”At the National Business Aviation Association in Washington, Ed Bolen, president and chief executive, is also cautious. “Maybe over the last two to three months, there has been an emerging consensus that things have stopped getting worse,” he says.The gloom is understandable. The shock within the industry has been profound as it swerved from a
record boom to one of the worst crises in its history.Business jet deliveries surged to more than 1,000 in a single year for the first time in 2007 and rose again in 2008 on the back of record backlogs built up by swelling orders. In 2009, however, deliveries will fall to between 750 and 800, according to the authoritative annual Honeywell Aerospace Business Aviation Outlook, published on Sunday. Next year it is expected to drop below 700.Only last year, Honeywell forecast that 17,000 new business jets worth $300bn would be delivered between 2008 and 2018. It downgrades the forecast sharply in its latest outlook to 11,000 new jets worth $200bn between 2009 and 2019.The turning point came in September last year when the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, prompted shockwaves that hit the sector from one side of the world to the other, along with the global financial community whose trajectory it tracks so closely.“That’s when it all kind of stopped,” says Stephen Grimes, chief executive of Ocean Sky group, a UK private jet company offering charter, brokerage and aircraft management services. “That is when the bad times really set in.”In Wichita, Kansas, home of Cessna, the company that boasts it has sold more aircraft than any other, the impact was also striking. “We ended up in a free fall,” says Jack Pelton, chief executive.Cessna has cut almost half its workforce of nearly 16,000 over the last year, as it struggled to throttle back on a booming production programme, contributing heavily to the more than 19,000 jobs that Gama’s Mr Bunce says have now been lost within the industry.“I think the most gut-wrenching thing for our members is lay-offs and furloughs,” said Mr Bunce. “This is our family – people who have worked hard to build these great machines.”Mr Pelton has asked himself whether Cessna could have done anything differently, given the abrupt severity of the slump.“We were sitting in September 2008 taking in new orders at a record pace,” he says, “better than any year we have ever had.” Customers faced four-year waits for some aircraft. Analysts kept pressing the company to build more aircraft faster to deal with growing backlogs. And then “this thing just turned around and crashed. I don’t know what else we would have done.”Mr Pelton thinks the crisis has probably reached the bottom.At Canada’s Bombardier, however, Bob Horner, senior vice-president, sales, for business aircraft, is yet to be convinced. “It’s perhaps too early to say we have bottomed out,” he says. “We are seeing encouraging signs. We look at the key indicators and those indicators – such as the pre-owned market, the number of inquiries, the charter market – are all looking positive.”Bombardier has been forced to make job cuts, announcing nearly 4,400 this year, of which 3,210 had been completed last month.Job losses were still being announced at Dassault Falcon’s business jet completion centre in Little Rock, Arkansas, last month and at Hawker Beechcraft the month before.Some companies have not survived the crisis.In the London offices of Allen & Overy, the international law firm, lawyers say there continues to be an increase in aircraft repossessions in both the corporate aviation and mass passenger sectors. Litigation partner Peter Watson, a 20-year veteran of aircraft repossession work, says that in the current economic climate he expects conditions to worsen as winter approaches and summer traffic falls away.This fragility is underlined by the latest Business Jet Update from UBS, issued on October 2.It shows an estimated 2,932 business jets for sale at the end of September – a figure broadly in keeping with other estimates. This is almost 3 per cent lower than the previous month, but UBS says inventories are still 26 per cent higher than last year.Swollen inventories have meant falling prices. Average asking prices for Bombardier’s long-range Global Express BD-700 fell from $48.5m in September 2008 to $29.2m this September, says UBS. The super-large Gulfstream V/G500 went from $42m to $25.4m over the same period.“Overall, we still think the business jet market is characterised by significant oversupply, weak pricing and tight financing,” the report says. “While our key indicators indicate the market is stablising at lower levels, we still see risk of an extended downturn.”So when can the industry expect to see firm improvement? A consenus is emerging that it will be 2011 at the earliest.Teal Group’s Mr Aboulafia forecasts another three bleak years, in which corporate profits and economic growth do not rebound until late 2010; inventories take time to shrink and deliveries of new aircraft only start to grow in 2012.For signs of hope, it is best to look outside North America. Honeywell’s Business Aviation Outlook reports that global purchase plans actually improved over 2008 levels despite the economic turbulence of the last year, as the slump in North America was countered by an unexpected boost in purchase expectations elsewhere, especially Asia and Europe.“There’s definitely a piece of optimism there,” says Rob Wilson, president of business and general aviation at Honeywell Aerospace.“The improvement in overall purchase expectations is remarkable and indicative of the increasingly global nature of the industry and of improved outlooks for economic recovery in a number of regions outside North America.”International demand now accounts for more than 50 per cent of new aircraft purchase plans over the next five years, a trend Honeywell predicts will continue.For the many thousands still employed in the corporate aviation industry, that is a small but significant comfort in what seems likely to be another difficult year ahead."
215;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-10-15T16:30:12Z;United Technologies’ chairman to step down;;George David, United Technologies’ longtime chairman, will cede his post at the end of the year to Louis Chenevert, the US conglomerate’s chief executive.The move completes a transition that began three years ago, when Mr Chenevert was elected UTC’s operating chief, and brings an end to one of the most successful tenures by an American executive in the past 30 years.The 67-year-old executive is credited with transforming the company, whose businesses include Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines, Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators, into an industrial powerhouse and a favourite on Wall Street.“George leaves a superb legacy,” Mr Chenevert told reporters on Wednesday.Under Mr David’s stewardship, revenue tripled, the company’s international operations flourished and investors cheered. In his 14-year run as CEO, UTC’s total return outpaced that of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as well as peers such as General Electric and Honeywell – the rival conglomerate Mr David came within “a few minutes” of acquiring in 2000 before GE swooped in with a better bid.Mr Chenevert, 52, had run UTC’s largest division, Pratt & Whitney aircraft-engine unit, until his 2006 promotion to president and chief operating officer. He was named CEO in 2008.While Mr Chenevert’s gradual ascension to chairman was expected, Mr David credited his successor with steering UTC through a brutal economic downturn.Mr Chenevert’s response to the recession, along with his role in shepherding Pratt’s geared turbofan engine technology from early development to its recent wins with aircraft manufacturers Mitsubishi and Bombardier, helped convince the board it was time to complete the transition, Mr David said.“After a lot of deliberations, I think the board feels he is fully ready,” he said.Mr David agreed to serve as a consultant and adviser to UTC through next year.
216;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-09-15T22:25:33Z;Consolidation moves in China’s outsourcing;;Chinese outsourcing service provider iSoftStone plans to double its staff numbers through acquisitions over the next year, in a sign of the Chinese industry’s ambition to compete for business globally.“We have 7,000 employees now, but we plan to have at least double that number a year from now,” Liu Tianwen, chief executive, told the Financial Times.Mr Liu said the company would choose acquisition targets based on their potential to give the company access to new clients.His comments signal that the sector is nearing the level of consolidation analysts say is needed to challenge rivals in India, which lead by a wide margin in the global outsourcing business.McKinsey, the consultancy, said in a report earlier this year that Chinese outsourcers had the potential to grow into serious competitors to their Indian peers, but added that the industry in China was still too fragmented.Mr Liu said the industry was about to change. “Our top 10 players are all pretty much the same size,” he said. “There has to be consolidation.”China had more than 3,300 companies providing outsourcing services to multinationals last year, but the total contract volume was just $4.7bn, less than 10 per cent of global outsourcing revenues.In March iSoftStone acquired two smaller rivals in southern China, Sidaronghe and MCDL-Frontline. The move brought iSoftStone new business from Huawei, the fast-growing telecom equipment maker.Neusoft, China’s largest software maker, which is also among the country’s top five outsourcing service providers, is similarly ambitious.Last month it acquired the mobile phone software development and testing business of Sesca, the Finland-based outsourcing firm, to give it a better base to target potential customers in Europe.Last year iSoftStone had $89m in revenues. Neusoft had $543m, but less than $200m of that came from the outsourcing business. Other leading Chinese outsourcing providers include VanceInfo, Chinasoft and hiSoft.Neusoft and iSoftStone both say they have been picking up new business rapidly since the onset of the financial crisis. The iSoftStone chief executive said multinationals were trying to balance their risks and costs by outsourcing to China as well as India.“Citi, Fidelity, UBS, Honeywell, Boeing and BT are now all here,” he said.iSoftStone, which counts Huawei, Microsoft and IBM as its three largest customers, has been particularly successful in gaining new business from Japanese and South Korean firms, adding Mizuho Bank, Sony and Sharp as customers over the past two years.“Chinese companies have an advantage over Indian ones in serving them because we are closer geographically and culturally,” Mr Liu said.Another key factor helping Chinese outsourcing providers is the fact that China is the global manufacturing base for most electronics products.“The software intensity in such gadgets is increasing, and that helps us gain new business,” said Liu Jiren, chief executive of Neusoft, in a separate interview.
217;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Brussels v Oracle;;"So much, it might seem, for the thaw between US and European Union trust-busters. Christine Varney, President Barack Obama’s choice as the US justice department’s antitrust chief, has pledged to reassert the government’s role in policing anticompetitive behaviour after the laisser-faire Bush years. That should chime with the European Union’s more interventionist approach. Yet the European Commission last week extended its investigation of Oracle’s planned $7.4bn merger with Sun Microsystems into a second stage of up to four months – after Washington cleared it without conditions. Cue alarm bells all round. This is the first big all-US merger the EU has examined during the Obama presidency; if blocked, it would be the first US deal to suffer that fate since General Electric-Honeywell in 2001.But hold on. Brussels has not blocked the deal, nor even concluded yet that there is a competition issue. It does, however, want more time to examine whether there might be, in one area: that the deal could thwart the growth of MySQL, a popular, open-source, corporate database programme owned by Sun that competes with Oracle’s proprietary software. Oracle says since MySQL is open-source, by definition there are no obstacles to competitors developing commercial products based on it; rivals have complained to Brussels that there are. The Commission, unlike the US regulator, is legally obliged to probe any potential competition problem, otherwise it can be challenged in the European Court.Oracle is angry about the delay; competitors are utilising the uncertainty to poach clients from Sun. Yet while there may be blame on both sides, Oracle was late in officially notifying the deal to Brussels – on July 30, three months after it was announced. It may have miscalculated that if it could get US approval, the EU would rubberstamp it. Oracle’s best approach now is full co-operation with Brussels to resolve what both say is a minor issue. Then a deal that both also agree is, overall, pro-competitive can proceed.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
218;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-08-26T20:23:16Z;Wall Street shrugs off mixed data;;"US stocks closed a whisker higher after a choppy day of trade on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed set of economic data.A disappointing reading on durable goods orders for July weighed on industrial stocks, which were the day’s weakest sector.Although the headline figure was encouraging, analysts focused on the number that excluded transportation, discounting the temporary effect of the government’s cash-for-clunkers programme.That data was worse than expected, which triggered widespread selling in the industrial sector.Caterpillar, the machinery maker, dropped 1.2 per cent to $47.25, while
Honeywell, the manufacturing conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $37.12.General Electric was also caught up in the selling, in spite a new $2.7bn contract to build a power plant in Kuwait and reports of a possible $2bn sale of its security unit. The shares fell 1.3 per cent to $14.11.The early falls were mitigated by a sharp rise in monthly sales of new homes , which boosted the homebuilding sector.Lennar gained 4.1 per cent to $15.58 and DR Horton climbed 5.7 per cent to $13.79.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all closed a fraction higher at 1,028.12, 9,543.52 and 2,024.43, respectively.That constituted the seventh successive positive session for the Dow.“Until it becomes clear that there is a sustainable economic trend you are going to see this kind of mixed data,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential.“More worrying is the fact that the markets have sold off towards the close recently.”Metals producers came off their recent highs as commodity prices dipped. Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $63.13, while Nucor, which makes steel, fell 2.4 per cent to $45.28.“Commodity shares could find a headwind with Chinese stocks soft and crude oil finding resistance at $75,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Financial stocks were also lower in spite of the housing data as well as figures showing that mortgage applications rose last week, defying a rise in mortgage rates.Signs of stabilisation in the housing market have lifted banks to the forefront of the recent rally, but they slipped on Wednesday as investors took an opportunity to take profits off the table.Citigroup declined 2.5 per cent to $4.63 and JPMorgan lost 0.6 per cent to $43.30.Morgan Stanley drifted 2.2 per cent to $29.53, even as rumours intensified
surrounding the sale of its Van Kampen investment unit, with Bloomberg reporting that the bank has approached at least three other asset managers with offers of a possible partnership or sale.Retailers were higher during the day, building on the gains made during Tuesday on the back of an unexpectedly sharp rise in consumer confidence.Budget retailers were especially strong, carried by the momentum from the previous session, when Big Lots reported better earnings than expected.The company was one of Tuesday’s strongest performers and rose again on Wednesday morning, picking up 3 per cent to $26.37.Rival Family Dollar climbed 3.5 per cent to $30.82.Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, jumped after it reported a surprise profit and said that tight inventory control would see it earn more over the year than previously forecast.The sharp cost cuts mitigated slumping sales at the company, which also owns the Pottery Barn furnishings chain, and the shares rose 11.3 per cent to $17.21.Health insurers suffered however, as analysts predicted that the death of Senator Edward Kennedy could provide further impetus to government plans to reform healthcare.They said the Democrats may want to honour the memory of one of the strongest advocates for such reform.With the current plan proposing cuts in government subsidies to large health insurers, Humana lost 2.7 per cent to $36.15, while UnitedHealth fell 3.3 per cent to $28.93."
219;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-07-27T21:14:11Z;Lloyds and Pearson help Footsie equal record run;;Lloyds Banking Group was among the best performers as the London market managed to extend its winning streak to a record-equalling eleven consecutive session – but only just.Shares in Lloyds added 6.9 per cent to 88.33p as Nomura upgraded to “buy” and set a 100p target price ahead of next Wednesday’s half year results.Analyst Robert Law said that while there were uncertainties, such as the outcome of the European Union investigation into state aid, with markets willing to discount a turn in the credit cycle attention would now focus on underlying earnings at Lloyds.To that end, Mr Law thinks Lloyds can generate earnings per share of 15p over the next couple of years, even if underlying profits fall by a quarter.“As substantially all the highest-risk assets are believed to be included in the [government’s] asset protection scheme, we believe the group’s tangible book has among the least downside of major banks,” he added.The FTSE 100, meanwhile, closed 9.5 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 4,586.1, having struggled into positive territory in the closing auction period. That took the index’s gains over the past 11 sessions to 10.6 per cent, against 7.1 per cent in 1997 and 4.1 per cent in 2003/04, when the FTSE 100 enjoyed a similar run.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 fell 61.6 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 7,876.8.Pearson was the day’s top gainer, advancing 12.1 per cent to 679p after the publisher of the Financial Times reiterated its full-year earnings guidance following a strong performance in the first half of the year.However, much of the index’s upward impetus came from the mining sector, which was lifted by a weaker dollar and some bullish comments from Morgan Stanley strategist Teun Draaisma.“Latest estimates don’t appear to fully factor in the rise in commodity prices already seen,” he said, as Lonmin added 4.7 per cent to £13.01, Kazakhmys rose 4.4 per cent to 846½p, and BHP Billiton put on 1.5 per cent to end at £15.78.On the downside, Rexam dropped 12.1 per cent to 284½p after the world’s leading drinks can maker revealed that it was considering an equity fund raising. The news surprised analysts who were also sceptical of Rexam’s claim the cash was needed to maintain its investment grade credit rating.“The reason that management now believe the risk of being downgraded is now ‘unacceptably high’ is that they’ve seen no pick up in trading in the second quarter and do not expect a recovery in the second half,” commented Oriel Securities. “This is totally out of kilter with the increasing bullishness of [US rivals] Crown and Ball.”British Airways dipped 3.4 per cent to 132.3p after Ryanair warned full year net profits would come in towards the bottom end of a €200m-€300m range because of falling yields, or average fares.Friends Provident added 2 per cent to 72.2p after suitor Resolution, up 0.8 per cent to 91¾p, said it would be consulting with shareholders after seeing its increased offer of 75.2p a share for the insurer rebuffed.Engineer IMI provided the session’s speculative feature, adding 1.1 per cent to 328¾p amid talk of predatory interest from Honeywell.The US industrial conglomerate, which is on the look out for deals, was rumoured to have run the slide rule over IMI 18 months ago. Sector specialists said IMI, whose products include drinks dispensing, air conditioning and power turbine components, would be a good fit for Honeywell’s control and automation business.In the same sector, Bodycote drifted 3.1 per cent to 127p ahead of half-year numbers. However, Credit Suisse said restructuring measures should help Bodycote meet expectations.Hunting, the oil field services group, lost 5.1 per cent to 418¼p after a bearish note from Cazenove. The broker is worried that half -year results could disappoint, particularly with regards to the performance of Hunting’s Well Completion and Well Construction businesses.Findel, the catalogue shopping company, was in demand on Monday. Its shares jumped 33.9 per cent to 35¼p on further consideration of Friday’s trading statement and £81m fund raising.“The capital raising programme will significantly dilute earnings but will ensure the survival of the business,” said Freddie George at Seymour Piece, who reckons the company should be capable of achieving earnings per share of 8p-10p over the next couple of years.It was much the same story at Nighthawk Energy, which unveiled a £22m equity issue on Friday. Broker Daniel Stewart, which has set a 88p target price, said the cash would allow Nighthawk, up 12.1 per cent to 44p, to increase the development pace of its core assets.Mano River rose 4.1 per cent to 6.37p on talk that its iron ore assets in Sierra Leone could rival those of African Minerals, down 0.3 per cent at 289p.Polo Resources firmed 2 per cent to 3.85p after Canaccord Capital said the investment company traded at an unwarranted discount to its 6p estimate of net asset value. One of Polo’s biggest holdings is a 26 per cent stake in Caledon Resources, an Australian coking coal company. Traders believe an Indian bidder is talking to Polo about what price it would except for its holding in Caledon, off 2.3 per cent at 52¾p.Gulf Keystone added 2.2 per cent to 11¾p in spite of concerns about its cash position. The exploration company, which has assets in Kurdistan, said at the time of its annual results in June that securing further funding was a priority and it has been using an equity credit line to draw down £2.4m of funds.Syndicate Asset Management added 0.8 per cent to 2.67p after Saad, the troubled Saudi investment group, said it no longer had a disclosable interest.Renew Holdings, a specialist construction company, eased 1.7 per cent to 29p.
220;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-07-27T20:31:07Z;Late rally lifts Wall Street;;US equities posted small gains on Monday, as investors digested a mixed array of earnings results that overshadowed better news on the housing front.In New York, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 982.18 and closed at a fresh eight month peak.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 1,967.89, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 9,108.51, with Verizon’s latest earnings weighing on sentiment.After the closing bell, Amgen provided some earnings cheer, as its second quarter earnings beat estimates and shares of the biotech company jumped in afterhours trade.The S&P 500 reached its high for the day, at 982.49, after reports that new home sales in June rose 11 per cent from May and inventories of unsold homes dropped to their lowest level since February 1998.While median home prices dropped 12 per cent over the past year, the data provided further evidence that the housing market may have bottomed said economists. The S&P home builders index rose 5.7 per cent.Among the 10 main S&P industry sectors, financials rose 1.5 per cent with information technology lagging by 0.3 per cent.Equity volatility edged up with the S&P Vix (volatility index) trading above 24, after touching a low of 23 last week.Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos believes a normal range for Vix, is between 18 and 22. He said there is still a risk that the S&P 500 could drop back to 825.In the past two weeks, the S&P has risen about 11 per cent beyond 950, the level that had capped stocks since the end of May.Traders believe that the benchmark is on course to reach 1,000, a level not attained since last November. In recent weeks, banks have been raising their year-end targets beyond 1,000 for the S&P.This week’s earnings results will determine whether equities can maintain their recent strong run, say analysts. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup said that while companies reporting earnings to date, some 40 per cent of the S&P 500, have beaten forecasts by about 11 per cent, the results are still down approximately 25 per cent compared with a year ago.“To be fair, margins have been resilient as corporate management teams have been very effective at delivering the bottom line,” he said.Mr Levkovich said that while some worry about the sustainability of growth, it is not an issue until the second quarter of next year and that latecomers to the market rally could miss out as “stock prices will not stand idly by as they generally trade in sync with earnings”.Analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management said: “With liquidity still supportive, high cash levels still waiting to be deployed and a less volatile environment, as well as improved earnings and a reasonable message from technical signals, the near-term environment appears favourable.”Earlier in earnings news, Honeywell reported a drop of 38 per cent for its second-quarter earnings and after an early fall, its shares rose 0.7 per cent to $34.24.The company’s revenue dropped more than a forecast $7.73bn, falling 22 per cent to $7.56bn versus $9.67bn for the same period a year ago.Shares in Verizon dropped 1.6 per cent to $31 after a 21 per cent drop in profits to $3.16bn.The telecoms group announced 8,000 job cuts, and revenue increased 11 per cent to $26.86bn, boosted by growth in wireless subscribers.Corning, the maker of liquid crystal glass, generated second-quarter earnings of $611m, which beat forecasts, but its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $16.50.Meanwhile, Radioshack, the electronics retailer, also beat estimates as it cut costs, but its shares dropped 6.6 per cent to $15.In deals, Agilent Technologies said it plans to buy Varian for $1.5bn in cash, or $52 a share. Agilent rose 1.8 per cent to $22.66. Varian surged 29.1 per cent to trade at $50.61.Shares in Mylan, the drug maker, fell 12.6 per cent to $12.10 as the company denied a newspaper report that its workers overrode government-mandated quality controls.
221;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-07-27T19:51:16Z;Honeywell;;"You wouldn’t want to start from here. Like a tourist lost deep in the countryside, Honeywell is in an unenviable position. It is hardly surprising that such an industrial conglomerate finds itself mired in a recession but the group’s exposure to aerospace, automotive and commercial construction offers a chance to reflect on some of the hardest-hit areas of the manufacturing economy.In the aerospace business – making engines for business jets and cockpit instrumentation – even demand for spare parts is suffering as cost-cutting hits this traditionally resilient area. While aircraft hours flown are down 4 per cent on last year, sales of spare parts have dropped at seven times the rate. Nor does a quick turnround in the auto sector appear imminent. Honeywell’s Transport Systems saw profits down 83 per cent on the previous year. Yet the division is only expecting flat sequential growth next quarter.Reporting second-quarter results on Monday, Honeywell’s management admitted that 2009 earnings would be at the bottom end of its previous guidance. With overall sales down by a fifth, furious cost-cutting remains the name of the game: Honeywell has already cut gross costs to the tune of 2 per cent of sales this year.But while earnings forecasts are being slashed in expectation of further declines this year, the risk is for a continued stagnation in manufacturing well into 2010. Capital spending continues to be delayed, and even with US capacity utilisation at a postwar low, there may be further slack to come out. Morgan Stanley estimates that for the capital goods sector, cuts in inventory levels are still failing to keep pace with sales declines. The distance that companies such as Honeywell must trudge to get back to normality should not be understated.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

222;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-07-27T19:27:29Z;Short View: US profits;;"US profits are good, but are they that good?Over the past two weeks, stocks, as measured by the FTSE-All World index, rose
12 per cent, virtually without interruption. This was one of the best and most sustained rallies of the decade. The catalyst, plainly, came from corporate America.The earnings released last week for the second quarter were much better than expected last Monday morning. Then, the consensus estimate, according to Thomson Reuters, was that S&P 500 earnings would fall 35.1 per cent year on year. By the end of the week, this had improved to a decline of 31 per cent. The positive surprise easily explains the jump in share prices.But on January 1, brokers were braced for only an 11 per cent fall in the second quarter. The S&P is up 8.5 per cent since then. That is not because profits are better than forecast.The positivity instead comes from the guidance companies have offered for the future. Negative guidance, as came on Monday from Aetna and Honeywell, has raised doubts.More worryingly, companies generated their strong earnings from sales slightly below the forecasts brokers had made for them. Nomura research shows that positive earnings surprises outnumbered disappointments by 3.3 to 1, but for sales there were no more positive than negative surprises.The market is not surprised by how much companies are selling; it is surprised by how much companies have been able to cut their costs.At one level, this should not matter. Investors get a share of profits, not revenues. Sharper cuts in costs raise the chances of a rebound later, as low inventories imply more chance of a restocking boom later.But lower costs imply lower wages and less buying power for consumers. And sluggish revenues suggest consumers are not regaining strength.john.authers@ft.comwww.ft.com/shortviewForum: Discuss John Authers’ Short View"
223;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-07-27T18:35:01Z;Honeywell warns on profits;;"Honeywell International suffered a squeeze on results in all important divisions amid the downturn and warned its 2009 profit would fall at the low end of the range set by the conglomerate this year.The slump has left few industrial businesses unscathed, with Honeywell affected by falling demand for parts used in cars and business jets.Echoing statements by other conglomerates such as General Electric and United Technologies, the US-based group said it did not expect many of its markets to improve this year.Like those peers, Honeywell has turned to cost cuts.“Economic conditions remain challenging and we are not planning for any recovery in 2009,” said Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chief executive.“Our [important] process initiatives . . . are enabling the aggressive, company-wide repositioning and cost actions that will help Honeywell continue to deliver earnings and free cash flow in this tough environment.” the company forecast profit would total $2.85 a share this year on revenue of about $31.5bn (€22bn).To reach the less ambitious target could still prove difficult, requiring Honeywell to show a profit in the fourth quarter, wrote Stephen Tusa, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, in a note to clients: “While the quarter was fine, the back-end loaded nature of the guidance continues to suggest that even the low end of the prior range is a stretch, and we expect the Street to quietly move below the $2.85 in coming months.”Honeywell shares fell 4 cents to $33.95 in midday trading in New York. Honeywell’s net income fell 38 per cent to $450m, or 60 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $723m, or 96 cents, a year earlier.Revenue fell 22 per cent to $7.57bn, paced by weak sales at its transportation-systems arm.Operating profit at the aerospace division fell 25 per cent to $454m as sales fell 17 per cent.Automation and control solutions earned $346m, down 11 per cent from a year ago. Sales fell 17 per cent. Profit at transport systems fell 83 per cent to $25m; revenue dropped 41 per cent. The specialty materials arm earned $150m, down 19 per cent.Cost cuts – including trimming staff benefits and leaving jobs unfilled – will save about $900m a year, said Dave Anderson, chief financial officer."
224;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-07-20T21:23:38Z;Defence groups eye new sales targets;;This month, Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, reorganised the sales and marketing operation of its defence and space business to align it more closely with its customer base.The centrepiece of the restructuring is a new Swiss-based international division, whose first challenge is to go after business in India, where the company is pitching for a $4.5bn contract to upgrade the engines of 125 Jaguar ground attack aircraft.Garrett Mikita, the new head of the defence unit which had turnover last year of $5.3bn, says the shake-up is aimed at doubling annual revenue growth to around 7 per cent over the next five years.“We want to make sure we stay relevant,” Mr Mikita says. “Global change is happening in the defence industry.”Honeywell is one of a number of US defence contractors eyeing international markets with renewed interest – lured by increased spending by countries such as India and Brazil, just as Pentagon spending starts to flatten out and some larger programmes are cut.“With two wars underway since 2001 and a booming domestic market, prime contractors could focus on the US,” says Marko Lukovic, principal consultant in the aerospace and defence practice at Frost & Sullivan. “Now, the US market isn’t what it once was and they have to look elsewhere.”Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing’s defence business, says there is nothing to stop exports of its aircraft and services reaching 20 per cent of total revenues, up from about 16 per cent. “Lots of countries have the resources and the threat environment and need the equipment we provide.”Raytheon, the defence electronics contractor, is more ambitious. Foreign sales are already the highest in the sector at 20 per cent of revenue, or $4.6bn, and David Wajsgras, chief financial officer, says it is on course to hit 25 per cent.The move towards exports is under way. According to the Pentagon, US government-to-government sales have jumped from a range of $8bn to $13bn in the early part of the decade to about $27bn in the first half of this year alone.A key target is India. The country’s defence budget will exceed that of the UK for the first time this year, placing it among the top three global spenders, according to Frost & Sullivan. In the next 10 years it will spend $100bn on equipment – including $10bn on 126 fighter jets.For companies such as Boeing overseas markets are crucial because Pentagon orders are drying up. Sales in India and Australia and elsewhere could provide lifelines for Boeing’s F/A-18 and F-15 fighters and its C-17 transport aircraft. For all the enthusiasm, experts say the obstacles are significant. Securing export approvals from Congress and the US State Department, can be time consuming and frustrating.Technology transfer is another potential sticking point. Even the Lockheed Martin F-35, which is designed for export, has had its moments. In 2006, the UK, the main international partner on the programme, threatened to walk away after a spat over access to computer-software codes.Such issues are often wrapped in wider inward investment deals. Most governments require “offsets” where suppliers are compelled to reinvest a percentage of the contract value in local businesses. The process is arcane, open to corruption and increasingly demanding.Industry analysts point out that foreign governments are also feeling the pinch.“The problem is: what about the downturn?” says Rob Stallard with Macquarie Research. “Countries with grandiose plans 12 months ago are not so quick to pick up their cheque book now.”
225;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-07-12T18:20:14Z;Diversity helps MAN navigate the turmoil;;Håkan Samuelsson is in no doubt that being less of a conglomerate has helped in the current crisis.The chief executive of MAN, the German truck manufacturer that also makes diesel engines and turbines, recalls the days when investors spoke of “conglomerate discounts” and searched in vain for an equity story among its sprawling activities that ranged from steel trading to printing machines.Now he says “I get no criticism any more” from investors for being diversified. This has helped MAN after the truck market virtually collapsed last year while its diesel engine and turbine businesses held up.That might partly explain why MAN has topped the list for shareholder returns among European conglomerates this year while finishing bottom of last year’s rankings.FT research shows how most European conglomerates underperformed in terms of shareholder returns for both this and last year.US conglomerates did better last year but are struggling more this year. That suggests conglomerates are failing to live up to their own billing of providing more stability in recessions than focused companies.But Mr Samuelsson is adamant that conglomerates still have a role to play, giving two principles they need to follow and a big advantage in the current times.The first principle is size: he argues conglomerates should not be too sprawling. “It is very difficult to be leading or first-class in 12 businesses. You need to be focused enough to be leading in all of your businesses.”That sounds like bad news for the biggest such as Siemens in Europe and General Electric in the US, which are both present in more than 10 businesses.Dave Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, the US group, agrees that being a conglomerate is not an excuse for a poor market position: “We’re going to make sure that it’s a good industry first, and that we have a great position in it afterwards.” He adds that the simple strength of a conglomerate comes from diversification rather than being a pure-play company.Mr Samuelsson’s second principle is that “if you are doing more than one thing there still has to be a relationship between these areas”. Trucks and diesel engines share similarities, but a pure consumer business would be less obvious.Mr Cote says that the length of the business cycle is important for conglomerates. Asked about the poor recent performance of some conglomerates such as GE and ThyssenKrupp, he says: “I’d say it depends on how you’ve diversified, because if you’ve diversified into things that all move the same way at the same time, then it doesn’t help you much.”That mixture leads to Mr Samuelsson’s big advantage. He returns to history and asks: “Why did people originally create conglomerates? It was in bad times when there was not enough credit or money to invest. With conglomerates, you get your financing internally.”Will other conglomerates act similarly as the economy appears to stabilise somewhat?Daniel Stelter, head of the corporate development practice at Boston Consulting Group, says they should do, pointing to his analysis of companies after the Great Depression. Then, he says, groups such as GE did well by making bold moves such as buying up competitors and expanding into new areas. “The good ones will be bold and pick up some bargains,” he says.
226;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-06-23T20:37:27Z;Wall Street struggles for direction;;"US stocks struggled for momentum on Tuesday having crashed through several significant support levels during the previous session.An encouraging auction of government debt helped lift stocks during the afternoon. But the markets remained subdued after disappointing news from Boeing suppressed early gains, which came on higher commodities prices and economic optimism.The aircraft manufacturer announced a further delay to its 787 Dreamliner, which is already two years behind schedule, as the company looks to reinforce part of the bodywork. The news sent the shares tumbling 6.5 per cent to $43.87.There was a knock-on effect on other parts of the market, particularly on
Boeing’s suppliers.Honeywell lost 0.5 per cent to $31.43, Rockwell Collins slid 1.2 per cent to $41.91 and Goodrich fell 0.7 per cent to $49.07.Banking stocks also lost ground after initial rises as fresh economic data did not prove as positive as some had hoped.Sales of existing homes rose less than expected in May but most banks managed to hold on to some of their early gains as house prices remained relatively stable and manufacturing rose in the Richmond,
Virginia, area.Bank of America closed up 2.4 per cent at $12.23 and JPMorgan finished 2.1 per cent higher at $33.57.Commodities stocks also made a partial recovery as materials prices rose following a bruising previous session. The price of oil picked up, and was followed by energy companies. Schlumberger rose 1.9 per cent to $53.30 while ConocoPhillips climbed 2 per cent to $41.25.Metal producers were also higher following Monday’s losses. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, climbed 4.4 per cent to $47.18 while AK Steel gained 7.2 per cent to $17.68.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 895.10 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 8,322.91 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.1 per cent to 1,764.92.“I don’t think this is the start of a major pull-back,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services.“Buyers and sellers have come together and begun to agree on a fair price following the powerful rally, which is why we have seen sideways trade.”But Tim Howkins, chief executive of IG Group, said: “Equities need to go down again. They bounced too quickly and the feeling is we still need to see a
complete capitulation.”The mood on Wall Street was lifted by encouraging words from Moody’s, the rating agency, which said the triple A rating on US debt “remains solid”, easing fears about how costly it could become for the government to borrow and fund its stimulus plans.The optimism surrounding the government’s spending power was later boosted by the afternoon’s auction of Treasury debt.Kroger, the supermarket operator, reported better than expected profits before the market opened but the results failed to provide a fillip for the stock as revenues came in lower than analysts had predicted. The shares slipped 0.1 per cent to $21.76.There was better news for fellow retailer Office Depot, as it received a $350m cash infusion from BC Partners in return for a 20 per cent stake. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $3.89.Several pieces of news from the mobile-phone sector buoyed communications and technology companies.Intel rose after Bloom-berg reported that the company had won a contract to supply microchips to Nokia for use in its mobile-phone handsets.The deal would be a breakthrough in Intel’s efforts to secure a foothold in the mobile telephone market, and the shares gained 0.8 per cent to $15.81.Meanwhile, Motorola picked up 4 per cent to $6.27 after Bank of America recommended buying the shares, saying that Motorola was having some success with new handset sales to carriers.Metro PCS, the mobile service operator, climbed on news that it would replace Tyco Electronics in the S&P 500 from June 29. This would mean the company’s shares may be bought by investors trying to track the benchmark index. The stock advanced 5.2 per cent to $14.33. Tyco fell 2.6 per cent to $18.59."
227;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-06-15T01:08:32Z;Crisis changes companies’ operating model;;"Nine in 10 of the biggest companies worldwide have seen their operating models change because of the economic crisis, a report will show on Monday, in a sign of how the turmoil of the past 18 months has changed the business world.Nearly half of the 570 companies from all industries surveyed by Ernst & Young this month said their operating model had changed permanently, while a similar number said there had been a temporary shift.“It can be some quite profound changes to how you run the company. You actually have to find a whole new way to do things given the disconnects in supply chains and financing,” said John Murphy, of Ernst & Young.He pointed to examples such as having to deal with suppliers from completely different regions of the world; changes in share-based remuneration as profits plummet; and companies forced to generate more cash internally because of the difficulties of raising capital.But some leading managers were sceptical that the crisis would lead to lasting change.Dave Cote, chief executive of US industrial conglomerate Honeywell, said that, apart from the financial sector, “my guess is that the crisis is not enough to change people’s behaviour. I don’t think it will change the psyche of consumers, companies or countries.”Daniel Corsten, a professor at the IE business school in Madrid, also doubted how lasting the change would be, but underlined how some of the most successful business models – from companies such as Zara, Aldi and Toyota – had come out of times of adversity.“A lot of sustainable business models were born and tested in times of scarcity. Many of the current business models were created in times of abundance and hadn’t been field-tested until now,” he said.The Ernst & Young report also showed how more than half of businesses had changed their risk management processes, but only one-fifth of companies thought internal controls had been sufficiently updated.The companies surveyed, more than half of which had annual sales of more than $1bn while a quarter had in excess of $10bn, were divided on when a recovery might come, with a quarter saying the worst was already over, four in ten believing it would come by the end of the year, and two in ten by the second half of next year at the earliest."
228;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-06-14T23:47:15Z;Mexico aims high;;Cessna, the US aircraft manufacturer, in May announced the expansion of two plants in Northern Mexico that will produce fuselages, carbon-fibre wings, ventilation ducts and a host of small parts for its aircraft.In the same week, Bell Helicopter said it would start work on a new $85m plant in Mexico that would make electrical harnesses for its commercial helicopters. The second phase of the plan is to set up an industrial design and engineering centre.Together, the two projects are the latest investments in what has become one of Mexico’s most dyamic business sectors: aerospace.In the past three years, the industry has grown more than 100 per cent, and exports this year are expected to reach $4bn. Today, there are close to 200 companies in the sector – roughly one-third more than two years ago. In total, foreign companies are expected to invest between $1.2bn and $1.5bn in Mexican aerospace this year. Last year, that figure was $867m.“It has been one of Mexico’s success stories,” says Bruno Ferrari, president of ProMexico, the government’s investment promotion agency.ProMexico has worked closely with the private sector and the country’s Economy Ministry to attract leading international companies, which now include Safran, Goodrich, Honeywell, Bombardier and Cessna. It has also established a consistent presence at international aerospace shows such as Paris and Farnborough to raise Mexico’s profile as a destination for foreign direct investment.One of the natural advantages Mexico has over other countries is cheaper labour. According to Flavio Diaz, chief represenative in Mexico of Canada-based aerospace company Bombardier, his company can manufacture parts in Mexico for an average of 25 per cent less than elsewhere. “We are very competitive,” he says.Bombardier, which established two plants in the central state of Queretaro in 2005, has committed to investing a total of $350m over seven years. So far, it has been producing electrical harnesses for all of its models, and rear fuselages for the Global Express, its flagship corporate aircraft.Until now, it has transported its made-in-Mexico parts to its plant in Wichita, where it then assembles them into finished aeroplanes. In the long term, however, the idea is to make finished products in Mexico. “It is still too far away to predict a date, but building entire aircraft here from scratch to completion is what we want to end up doing,” says Mr Diaz.Mexico’s second advantage is that it is an open economy, and has preferential trade agreements with 44 countries, including the US and Canada via the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), as well as a free-trade agreement with the European Union.Carlos Bello, director of Femia, Mexico’s aerospace industry association, says that such open borders have allowed companies to import raw materials with much greater ease and at a much lower cost than they would be able to do in other countries. “Made-in-Mexico ends up costing less,” he says.Mr Bello also points out that many foreign aerospace companies have taken advantage of Mexico’s “maquiladora” regime, which allows them to import raw materials without paying any duty at all.A third advantage is distance to market. Operating in Mexico, unlike China, for example, means being just a few hours away from other plants in the US. That, in turn, allows companies to integrate operations with US plants. Just-in-time delivery is more reliable, and products can be adapted to changing needs far more quickly.“It takes at least 40 days to send something to China and get it back again,” says Mr Bello. “In Mexico, you can do it immediately.”Inevitably, however, there are challenges. One is the global economic recession, which has affected Mexico more than any other Latin American nation. The country’s proximity and dependence on the US – 80 per cent of the country’s exports go to its northern neighbour – has heightened Mexico’s vulnerability, and some private estimates suggest that the economy could shrink by as much as 8 per cent this year.The global downturn has already started to affect the local aerospace industry. Bombardier, for example, has been forced to cut about 10 per cent of the 1,000-odd workers at its Queretaro plants, and Mr Diaz says that the company cannot rule out further cutbacks.A second, and more structural problem is the fact that Mexico still does not have the capacity to certify manufacturers and their products. Even though the government signed the so-called Bilateral Aerospace Safety Agreement (Basa) with the US in 2007, it still has to establish an office and staff to be able to provide companies with a full certification process.That inability means that companies such as Bombardier cannot use local suppliers as much as they would like to because the companies often lack the certification required at the international level.Until that happens, says Mr Diaz, the development of the sector in Mexico will never reach its full potential. “What I most care about is being able to buy more in Mexico but I can’t do that until my sellers can get certified,” he says.Mr Bello of Femia agrees. But he also acknowledges that the government is making progress – albeit at a slower rate than most companies would like. And once the full Basa certification process is in place, he says that the sky will be the limit.
229;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-06-11T21:30:20Z;Honeywell chief says valuations inaccurate;;Corporate acquisitions are still too pricey despite the financial crisis as valuations in many industries fail to reflect the new reality, the head of one of the largest US industrial groups.Dave Cote, Honeywell chief executive, said the US conglomerate was looking for deals but thought the market was still overheated.“It is a very easy time to overpay right now because you have to remind everybody that it’s not last year anymore, it is this year,” he told the Financial Times in a video interview.“So we’ve actually pretty much cooled. We’re still looking extensively but we haven’t seen that recognition of value adjust to what the reality is yet.”His comments, in one of the first big interviews he has done in his seven years in charge of Honeywell, are significant because the US group is present in so many industries from aerospace, defence and chemicals to energy, cars and buildings.Honeywell, which last year had $37bn of sales, had already moved away from entering new industries because of price and has instead focused on sub-sectors such as gas detection and barcode scanning.Mr Cote, who worked at General Electric for 25 years before joining Honeywell in 2002, defended the performance of conglomerates in the downturn, saying that diversification had paid off.Pointing to its big operations outside the US and its spread between long and short-cycle businesses, Mr Cote said: “The more you have that kind of a mix, whether it is as a conglomerate or the industries in which you participate, it makes you a more robust performer that you can count on all the time.”Some conglomerates such as GE and ThyssenKrupp in Europe have been criticised for seeming to underperform in the downturn despite their arguments that diversification would give them an advantage.“I’d say it depends on how you’ve diversified . . . if you’ve diversified into things that all move the same way,” he said.Mr Cote, who serves on President Barack Obama’s stimulus task force, criticised the idea of governments interfering in executive pay.Speaking before the US administration’s plans for a “pay tsar”, he said: “Governments don’t get involved with what athletes get paid, [they] shouldn’t be getting involved with what managers get paid.”
230;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-05-31T23:11:01Z;Anacap raises €575m to buy finance groups;;"Anacap Financial Partners, which in May became the first private equity group to buy a UK bank, is expected to announce on Monday that it has raised €575m (£503m) to acquire more financial services businesses in Europe.The fundraising adds to the growing pile of private equity resources targeting the ailing financial services sector.Private equity is seeking bargains as banks and other groups are forced to sell assets to repair the holes left in their balance sheets by the financial crisis.In May, Anacap completed the purchase of Ruffler Bank, a 40-year-old leisure and property lender. The private equity group has agreed to inject £80m into the bank as part of plans to rapidly expand its lending book.The new fund, which is almost double the size of Anacap’s €300m debut fundraising in 2006, came from a string of big investors including Goldman Sachs, Allianz, Honeywell, Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, the State of New Jersey and Adams Street Partners.Two of its biggest investors, Goldman Sachs and the New Jersey Division of Investments, a $58bn (£36bn) pension fund, both recently acquired 5 per cent stakes in Anacap, underlining its popularity among blue-chip investors.“The most profitable time for banking is between the middle of a recession and the early point of recovery,” said Joe Giannamore, managing principal of Anacap. “After that the margins are so squeezed that all the money is lost in the next recession.”A growing number of private equity groups are circling the banking industry, but so far economic uncertainty and regulatory hurdles have put the brakes on most deals.In one such deal, Barclays has agreed to sell iShares, its exchange-traded funds business, to CVC Capital Partners, the private equity group, in a $4.2bn deal which still faces competition from rival trade and financial bidders.Private equity groups are also expected to feature prominently in the bidding for Fortis Intertrust Services, the trust-management business being sold by the troubled Belgian bank now owned by the government of the Netherlands and BNP Paribas.Anacap was founded by Mr Giannamore in 2006. after he stepped down as head of GMAC UK, the finance arm of General Motors.He previously sold On:line Finance, a motor finance company, to GMAC UK and worked in the investment banking sector with Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Citicorp.Before buying Ruffler, Anacap had completed three acquisitions.Those were Syscap, a London-based IT equipment finance company; Credoma, a Czech-based mortgage lender; and Apex Credit Management, a UK debt collection company.It has also financed two start-ups.Those are Conduit Capital Markets, a structured financial products brokerage, and Base Commercial Mortgages, which recently suspended new lending.Anacap plans to merge Ruffler with Base Commercial Mortgages."
231;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-03-20T00:03:55Z;Lawyers criticise Beijing bar of takeover;;China’s rejection of Coca-Cola’s planned $2.4bn takeover of Huiyuan Juice is based on questionable logic and could be retaliation for previous US protectionism, say competition lawyers.China’s ministry of commerce (Mofcom) stunned bankers, lawyers and investors on Wednesday by blocking the deal, which would have been the largest foreign takeover of a Chinese company. The decision was based on competition grounds, namely that Coke might abuse its dominant position in China’s fizzy drinks industry by imposing bundled sales of juice drinks.Mofcom also said the deal would have had an adverse impact on China’s smaller domestic juice makers.The single-page ruling has prompted a barrage of comment from competition lawyers, who say China is using the anti-monopoly regime – which was beefed up last August – to thwart politically-sensitive foreign investment.Lovells, the law firm, said: “There are question marks as to the logic behind such reasoning as is provided in the decision.” Kirstie Nicholson, a Beijing-based lawyer with Lovells, said concerns about bundling could have been dealt with by imposing behavioural conditions or penalties should it occur.However, some lawyers said other anti-trust regimes have used concern over bundling to try to stop deals, and that China’s evolving anti-trust rulings would mature. An example was the European Union trying to block General Electric’s takeover of Honeywell in 2001, a ruling that was later overturned in court.Allen & Overy, the London-based international law firm, criticised the explicit defence of Huiyuan’s smaller rivals, noting that “the fundamental goal of competition law is to protect competition, not any select group of competitors”.John Taladay, partner in the Washington practice of Howrey, said the anti-trust unit within Mofcom was not an independent agency like in the US and the European Union, and was therefore “not immune to political pressure”. He added: “You have to wonder if [the decision] isn’t payback for resistance that Cnooc faced when it tried to acquire Unocal.” China National Offshore Oil Corp withdrew its 2005 bid for Unocal, the US oil company, after a political backlash in Washington.Chinese officials have sought to play down concerns that the rejection was forced by a public outcry over the loss of a leading juice brand.The FT reported – before Mofcom’s announcement – that Coke had been asked by regulators to relinquish the Huiyuan brand in order to secure deal approval.
232;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-01-28T23:58:52Z;Democrats force through stimulus bill;;The House of Representatives on Wednesday night approved its version of the proposed US fiscal stimulus with overwhelming Democratic support but, in an early setback for Barack Obama, not a single Republican backed the $825bn plan.The president has spent much of his first week in office reaching out to Republicans in a bid to forge a bipartisan consensus behind the stimulus but the House vote indicated that opposition is hardening.The White House welcomed the 244-188 vote as an “important first step” towards final legislation, which Mr Obama wants to sign into law by mid-February, but the president also made clear he was open to changes as debate shifts to the Senate.“I hope that we can continue to strengthen this plan before it gets to my desk,” Mr Obama said in a statement. “But what we can’t do is drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way.”The president on Wednesday rallied support from business leaders for the stimulus in a meeting at the White House with chief executives from 13 large companies, including Eric Schmidt of Google and Sam Palmisano of IBM.Speaking afterwards, Mr Obama said the barrage of heavy job cuts at large US companies this week demonstrated the need for Congress to move quickly, with Boeing and Starbucks the latest to announce thousands of lay offs on Wednesday.“The businesses that are shedding jobs to stay afloat cannot afford inaction or delay,” he said. “They are looking to Washington for action – bold and swift.”Republicans have praised the president for trying to work across party lines but have accused congressional Democrats of ignoring Mr Obama’s calls for ­compromise.Mike Pence, the third-ranking House Republican, complained that the bill ­contained too much wasteful spending and too little tax relief.“What House Democrats have done here is get out a dusty old wish-list of liberal spending priorities, dump it all in a bill, and throw in a few token tax cuts on top of it,” he said. “That’s not going to create jobs.”Mr Obama intervened this week to persuade House Democrats to remove an item that would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars for family planning services, but Republicans on Wednesday seized on other surviving measures, including an anti-smoking programme, as evidence of misplaced priorities.Business leaders who attended Wednesday’s White House meeting – including David Cote of Honeywell, Sam Palmisano of IBM, Greg Brown of Motorola and Anne Mulcahy of Xerox – offered broad support for the stimulus in a joint appearance with Mr Obama afterwards.But business associations have echoed Republican criticism that the House bill contained too few incentives to spur job creation and too much unfocused government spending.“President Obama and Congress are right to take swift and bold action on the stimulus, but it is just as important to get it done right as it is to get it done quickly,” said Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the US Chamber of Commerce. “The good news is we expect a number of changes in the Senate version.”The Senate finance and appropriations committees passed their drafts of the bill this week, but Senate rules allow considerable leeway for the bill to be changed.The Senate bill is likely to see another struggle over “Buy American” provisions which restrict federal spending to goods and services produced by US companies.The current version of the Senate bill contains no such restrictions, but senators such as Sherrod Brown from Ohio are pushing for spending to be kept at home.“Buy America provisions will ensure that US taxpayer dollars go toward the creation of US jobs,” Mr Brown said on Wednesday.
233;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2009-01-19T23:32:38Z;Regulators set to renew a mainframe battle with IBM;;It is 40 years to the week since the US government filed its last official antitrust complaint against IBM, and more than 50 years since it reached a landmark consent decree with the computer maker to open up the early computing industry.Yet some technology monopolies never die. The market for mainframes – the heavy-duty, monolithic machines that dominate the high-end of the computing market – once attracted the attention of companies including General Electric to Honeywell.As recently as the 1990s, the mainframe industry attracted competitors such as Hitachi and the Fujitsu-owned Amdahl.Today, though, it is once again the almost exclusive preserve of IBM, with whose name it has become almost synonymous.That is now set to come under renewed scrutiny, with European regulators preparing to blow the dust off a case history that dates back almost as far as the computing industry itself. Armed with its big 2007 legal victory over Microsoft, the European Commission now believes it has the precedent to dig further into some of the tech world’s most entrenched markets.Ironically, the renewed attention to IBM’s historic mainframe monopoly comes at a time of rampant innovation in the type of high-powered computing that powers corporate and government data centres.New technologies such as multi-core processors (chips that can run several instructions simultaneously) and virtualisation (software that turns a single computer into a number of independent “virtual” machines) have given customers new, lower-cost choices in how to handle their most intensive computing tasks.“IBM’s [profit] margin is nowhere near where it used to be – they’ve had a lot of competition” from these new computing architectures, said John Phelps, an analyst at Gartner. “People do have the options of moving off the mainframe, and they are doing it.”However, legacy computing systems such as the IBM mainframe often have a surprisingly long life. With its biggest customers having written billions of lines of software code over the years to run on the machines, the cost of switching to new systems can be substantial. That is particularly true for governments, banks, retailers, healthcare companies and others in transaction-intensive industries with large numbers of customers.To get around this barrier, companies such as T3 have come up with techniques to “trick” software applications into thinking they are running on a mainframe when in fact they are actually installed on lower-cost standardised servers based on chips from Intel or AMD. This technique, known as “emulation”, relies on software that can only be produced with the approval of IBM, since it uses some of Big Blue’s patented mainframe technology.This touches on the central issue at stake in the latest complaint against IBM in Europe. Though it used to license an earlier generation of the necessary technology, the computing giant has dropped that practice with its latest generation of 64-bit mainframe software, leaving potential rivals with no way to produce machines that are compatible with IBM’s.IBM has accused rivals of infringing its patents by trying to produce their own mainframes, and maintains that mainframes are not a monopoly since it faces competition from many other high-end computing systems.Yet one sign of the significant potential in the mainframe market was the powerful list of backers that lined up behind Platform Solutions Inc, a Silicon Valley start-up launched by several former Amdahl engineers to take on IBM (Amdahl, along with Hitachi, backed out of the market in 2000 after deciding they could not sustain the investment needed to follow IBM into the new phase of 64-bit computing.)Microsoft, Intel and Goldman Sachs all put money into PSI. However, after fighting a legal battle with Big Blue and lodging a formal complaint with European regulators a year ago, PSI agreed to be bought by its giant rival, effectively putting an end to the case.The support that PSI won from some of IBM’s biggest rivals suggests that the T3 case now before Europe will become the centerpiece for a duel between industry heavyweights.Had PSI been successful in pushing through its case against IBM, it could have been of particular benefit to Hewlett-Packard, according to Gartner. HP has been the main supporter of Intel’s Itanium chip, a processor that was once seen as a significant rival to IBM’s mainframe business but which has largely remained a computing backwater.Microsoft’s interest in fostering an IBM rival also points to potential opportunities for its own software in high-end computing.
234;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-12-15T19:44:39Z;Financials retreat on bank earnings fears;;Financials led US stocks lower on Monday as investors braced themselves for losses at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.Shares in the banks lost a further 1.9 per cent to $66.46 and 1.5 per cent to $13.64 after bad runs last week, as traders positioned themselves ahead of fourth-quarter earnings due on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.Both are expected to disclose quarterly losses – in Goldman’s case, the first since it went public in 1999.Among the institutions to come under heavy selling pressure, JPMorgan fell 7.5 per cent to $28.63 after Merrill Lynch forecast a fourth-quarter loss and downgraded its recommendation on the stock from “underperform” to “neutral”.“We do not believe the Street has rationalised the true impact of expected economic woes on consumer credit, and particularly what that means for JPM earnings,” said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst.Fragile confidence in the financial sector, which finished 4 per cent lower overall, took a further knock as several European institutions disclosed exposure to Bernard Madoff’s alleged $50bn fraud.The S&P 500 closed down 1.3 per cent at 868.57 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent lower at 8,564.53 points, as the Federal Reserve continued its two-day meeting on interest rates.The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.1 per cent at 1,508.34 points, reflecting losses in the technology sector.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 4.8 per cent to 56.90, which indicated heightened signs of distress.The telecoms sector sustained heavy losses, down 3.1 per cent overall after Goldman Sachs warned that the industry could be hurt by customers renegotiating deals.Qwest sank 11.8 per cent to $2.77. AT&T dropped 3.7 per cent to $27.13 after Goldman analysts downgraded their recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, as analysts also expected the company to take substantial losses in 2009 from its pension plan. “The immediate earnings drag can be substantial and stock performance has historically suffered as the market absorbs the near-term impact.”Property-related stocks also suffered some of the heaviest losses amid fresh concerns over their increasingly harsh operating environment.Developers Diversified Realty was among several real estate investment trusts to come under heavy selling pressure. Its shares tumbled 17.4 per cent to $4.70 after the group warned it had not yet reached an agreement to sell assets.DR Horton was one of the biggest losers among housebuilders, down 9.8 per cent $7.02 after Fitch cut its debt rating on a host of companies in the sector.National Association of Home Builders figures that showed industry sentiment remained at its lowest level on record also helped push the sector 7.5 per cent lower overall.The industrial sector lost ground, but still outperformed the wider market following the release of mixed economic data.Bucking the downward trend, Honeywell rose 6.3 per cent to $30.78 as investors were relieved when the group reiterated its earnings outlook for the year.Hopes that the Bush administration would intervene to prevent a collapse of the car industry also helped pare the market’s losses.General Motors rose 3.6 per cent to $4.08 and Ford gained 4.6 per cent to $3.18 after President Bush indicated that a rescue of the industry was likely to come soon, although he added that an announcement was not imminent.Energy stocks provided the market with support early in the session as US crude rose above $50 in intraday trade ahead of this week’s Opec meeting.However, the sector tracked the price to stand 0.3 per cent lower overall.In addition to the US Supreme Court’s ruling that smokers could sue tobacco companies for deceptive advertising of “light” cigarettes, the sector also came under pressure from a bearish JPMorgan note.The analysts warned that earnings next year would be hit by higher excise taxes.Lorillard, which they downgraded to “neutral”, lost 1.6 per cent to $57.89.
235;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-12-08T21:43:45Z;Manufacturers’ grim outlooks spark new fears;;Large US manufacturers could unleash a wave of bad news in coming weeks after two of the biggest diversified companies in the sector lowered their profit forecasts on Monday, underlining the depth of the problems facing the industry.3M, one of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, said it was cutting its earnings forecast for this year by about 6 per cent and issued guidance for next year well below expectations, while Illinois Tool Works, the engineering group, slashed its fourth-quarter earnings outlook by about 40 per cent.Other industrial companies could follow their lead. United Technologies and Danaher are due to give forecasts for next year on Thursday, while Honeywell, General Electric and ITT are due to issue their expectations for earnings next week.US factory orders fell by the most in eight years in October, according to US government data released last week that also recorded the third consecutive month of decline.Citing the “turbulent global economy”, 3M dropped its guidance for earnings-per-share for 2008 from $5.40-$5.48 to $5.10-$5.15 and said profits for 2009 would be $4.50-$4.95 per share, behind analysts’ forecasts of about $5.39.The company said it had already cut 1,800 jobs in the US, western Europe and Japan – saving $170m – and indicated that more redundancies were likely. “During these difficult economic times, we will continue to aggressively manage our costs,” said George Buckley, chairman, president and chief executive. “We are prepared to implement additional restructuring as economic conditions dictate.”3M said it was expecting a 10 per cent decrease in organic volume in the fourth quarter and a fall of between 3 per cent and 7 per cent in 2009. The company said currency translation would reduce sales by 6 per cent to 7 per cent next year.Illinois Tool Works said the downward revision of its earnings forecast “reflects significant further weakening in North American and international end markets, the negative impact from currency translation and higher than originally anticipated restructuring costs”.The company said it expected fourth-quarter earnings to be in the range of 44 cents to 52 cents per share, compared with the 74 cents to 82 cents it advised in October.“This new forecast assumes a total company revenue decrease of 7 per cent to 9 per cent,” ITW said.● Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, said on Monday it planned to cut about 1,400 jobs in the US, will not fill 250 vacant positions and will eliminate 415 contractor jobs. The company said the redundancies will incur pre-tax expenses of about $197m.
236;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-10-21T18:35:14Z;Conglomerate model could provide shelter from the storm;;"The conglomerate model has returned to the spotlight as economic conditions decline. Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of German industrial group MAN, has said that its diverse holdings, which are subject to differing business cycles, put it in a better position to weather recession. Ekkehard Schulz, head of steel and industry conglomerate ThyssenKrupp, has also pointed to the model as a way to offset market risk. This issue therefore raises a question for more streamlined businesses. If managers spot an opportunity to buy a non-core company at a steep discount, should they act on it? Do the advantages of breadth outweigh investors’ disdain for unfocused groups?THE EXECUTIVE
Ben W Heineman Jr
Properly conceived and run, the conglomerate model is more than countercyclical. It can provide market intelligence on a developing nation or difficult market from different perspectives. It can move managers across businesses, giving them diverse experiences that broaden their skills and make them more flexible. A cash flow business can help support a capital intensive business without incurring as much debt for the group as a whole. If it can present one face to the customer, a conglomerate can effectively cross-sell and augment orders and sales. These are important, enduring performance benefits flowing from the conglomerate model that might overcome current market disfavour. But to attain them managers must be skilled at cross-business motivation and integration. A single bolt-on for the purpose of providing countercyclical revenue – as opposed to a thoughtful conglomerate strategy – would not seem the way to go. Multi-business companies in the US such as United Technologies, Honeywell and General Electric have, for decades, had success in realising significant benefits from a diverse portfolio beyond countercyclical revenues.

While conglomerate structures may appear to offer more resilience in tougher economic climates – as the constituent businesses may span a series of end markets and regions – it is worth remembering that these structures are often the result of capital allocation decisions that have generated and will continue to generate poor returns for shareholders. Therefore, while they may represent a port in a storm, they are fundamentally unattractive business models. This is often because the areas that “demand” the most investment tend to be the areas performing well and subsequently where prices for assets are the most rich. The business models that I believe have been genuinely underappreciated are larger vertically integrated business, such as major oil companies. These are better able to produce good returns for shareholders over the cycle since their structure acts largely, though not entirely, to dampen volatility of earnings and thus make the capital allocation process more manageable.

It is clever and opportunistic for Mr Samuelson and Mr Schulz to rationalise the diversity of MAN Group and ThyssenKrupp as an advantage; a great narrative to feed to jittery capital markets. The fundamental logic, however, is hard to defend. The conglomerate adds a layer of costs and bureaucracy, so it must add an even greater level of value to individual business units to provide a net benefit. It is hard to find data to support that notion, especially in broadly diversified groups. In fact it is conceited to think that the conglomerate can outmanage its focused competitors across an entire diverse portfolio. GE is famously cited as the one sustained shining example of that conceit; but it is questionable whether its diverse portfolio is an advantage anymore. Private equity groups have made hundreds of billions buying companies at a “steep discount” and turning them round. But they make their money by buying, turning round and then selling rather than by managing a portfolio.

Proponents of the conglomerate model argue that the benefits of a smoothed earnings and share price performance outweigh the economic costs. There is a challenging set of hurdles to overcome, though. First, sophisticated investors take account of the profit and risk contribution of different divisions and adjust their overall portfolio to achieve the profile they require – by investing across the market they have more options than conglomerate management. Second, can managers justify their claims to improve performance if they have to understand multiple and different business units? Finally, what shared benefits are achievable across different businesses in terms of infrastructure, procurement and other functions – can they offset the increased complexity and costs of ownership? At its most basic the conglomerate model has been superseded by two other forms: investment fund managers who now hold quoted shares with clearly understood performance and risk profiles in different weightings; and private equity, which takes on opportunities with high risk profiles and relies on highly incentivised management to deliver results.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. However, it finished the week down 1.2 per cent at 69.45.Technology stocks were down after three companies in the sector reported better than expected results after the bell on Thursday.Google rose 5.5 per cent to $372.54 after the internet search group’s profits surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis. Advanced Micro Devices and IBM added 2.2 per cent to $4.21 and lost 0.8 per cent at $90.78 after both surprised Wall Street with third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations.Aerospace and defence stocks fell after Honeywell trimmed its guidance for the rest of the year. The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.
239;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-10-07T21:56:22Z;Armor set to pay US government $30m;;A US subsidiary of BAE Systems has agreed to pay the US government $30m (£17.1m) to resolve claims that it knowingly sold defective body armour to federal agents and US state police that were not bullet-proof.Armor Holdings, whose acquisition by BAE Systems for $4.1bn was approved by US authorities last year, faced claims by the Department of Justice that it knowingly manufactured and sold defective Zylon bullet-proof vests.The settlement is part of a larger investigation of the body armour industry’s use of Zylon. The US had alleged that Armor Holdings manufactured and sold Zylon bullet-proof vests in spite of possessing information showing that the Zylon materials degraded quickly over time and were not suitable for ballistic use.Armor Holdings, which discontinued sales of vests containing Zylon in 2005 before it was bought by BAE, said yesterday that it “denies all of the DoJ’s allegations of wrongdoing, and maintains that it always has acted responsibly and with the utmost concern for police officer safety”. It said it agreed the $30m payment to “avoid the significant expense and inevitable uncertainty of litigation”.As part of Tuesday’s agreement, Armor Holdings has pledged its co-operation in the government’s ongoing investigation. The US previously settled with three other participants in the Zylon body armour industry for more than $16m.In June, the DoJ said it was to sue Honeywell for supplying Zylon material to Armor Holdings, following action the previous year against manufacturer Toyobo for supply of Zylon to other body armour manufacturers. “The Justice Department will not tolerate its first responders wearing defective bullet-proof vests,” said Gregory Katsas, assistant attorney-general for the department’s civil division. “This settlement will help ensure that first responders receive the highest quality ballistic protection.”Though the settlement is insignificant to the BAE subsidiary, it could result in embarrassment for the UK company, which has made Armor’s acquisition a central plank of its drive to establish itself in the US defence sector.
240;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-10-03T08:52:53Z;Growth falters as crunch bites;;Private jet users are flying fewer hours, as the world’s most privileged air travellers show they are not immune to the impact of the turmoil in financial markets and weakening economic growth.At the same time, business jets are rolling off the assembly lines in North America, France and Brazil in record volumes, with the leading producers comfortably cushioned by order backlogs built up in the recent years of very high demand. The most sought-after jets still have waiting times of three years and more.The jet makers also report that the stream of new orders so far this year has continued to exceed deliveries – the so-called book-to-bill ratio. That further swelling of order books is thanks in particular to strong demand from markets outside North America, which have compensated for the slowdown in the US.But signs are emerging that gravity cannot be defied for ever.Business jet service bases are reporting that they are selling lower volumes of fuel, especially in the US, as private jet flyers and corporate flight departments choose to fly less.According to Honeywell Aerospace, a large systems supplier to the corporate jet makers, recent reports from the US Federal Aviation Administration and from Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control organisation, point to reduced business aircraft flight activity in the US and Europe for the rest of this year and potentially also for 2009.Honeywell, which released its annual business jet forecast at the weekend, says: “Operators appear to be reacting to economic pressures and unexpected fuel price increases by reducing activity and in some cases putting aircraft up for sale.”Many flight department budgets for 2008 had not accounted for substantially higher fuel costs. Some had reported reduced flying activity or flights at slower cruise speeds to economise on fuel and remain within funded budget levels.Simon Pryce, chief executive of BBA Aviation, whose Signature division operates the world’s biggest network of business jet service bases, chiefly in the US, says the group saw its fuelling volumes decline by 7 per cent in the US in the first half of the year, with a faster decline of 9 per cent in the second quarter.Fuelling volumes are still about 7 per cent higher in Europe this year, but the traffic is reducing, says Mr Pryce, as European economies weaken. The growth is being driven by inbound traffic – in particular from the Middle East and Russia.Wealthy individuals and big corporations are continuing to fly, says Mr Pryce, but investment bankers are not doing as many roadshows. Those in the financial sector earning $3m-$4m bonuses last year who were using private jets in their leisure time were not expecting the bonuses this year and are choosing not to fly.“We see a particular weakness in the charter market, which is where the marginal user may go. There was a lot of fluff in 2007. People were being flagrant with their bonuses. That is the bit that has come out of the market…We are seeing a cyclical softness but not a change in the long-term growth prospects.”According to the business jet survey conducted by UBS, conditions in the private jet market have worsened significantly from the peak levels of last year. UBS said two weeks ago the international market appeared to be following the US down. The rise in the number of used aircraft available for sale and the decline in flight activity presaged “a significant slowing in new-order activity.”The shine has also come off the much-vaunted launch of the new category of very light jets in recent months. The pioneer of VLJs, Eclipse Aviation of the US, has this year gone through a change of ownership, and the ousting of its founder, Vern Raburn.It is currently seeking more funding at a desperate time in financial markets. It has been hit in recent weeks by the loss of its most important customer, DayJet.The new four-passenger jets, such as the Eclipse 500, Cessna Citation Mustang and Embraer Phenom 100, are being used by some buyers to create new business models for so-called air taxi operations, but the sector has had a difficult start.DayJet of the US, the world’s first operator of a “per-seat, on-demand” private jet service, said two weeks ago it had ceased operations until further notice and had cut most of its jobs after failing to secure critical refinancing.It had taken delivery of 28 Eclipse jets but had plans for up to 1,400.Despite the extreme dislocation of global credit markets, the impact appears to be more evident for commercial jet buyers rather than for business jet owners.Frederico Fleury Curado, chief executive of Brazil’s Embraer, said recently: “We see signals that the customers’ financing options are getting scarce.” He added, however, “We’re seeing less impact on our business jets, as those individuals and corporations that we target have easier access to credit, unlike the airlines.”The significant weakening of growth in private jet flying this year is reflected at NetJets Europe, by far the biggest operator of corporate jets in Europe.Bill Kelly, who takes over this month as NetJets Europe chief executive, says the group’s revenue flights this year grew by only 2 to 3 per cent and are likely to be flat for the full year – as against the 10-12 per cent growth initially expected. New customers are compensating for slightly lower flying levels by existing users.“We have seen some fall-off in in lifestyle flying – Friday afternoon to Sunday for skiing or to the south of France. People are flying slightly less and are spending more time in the office. Life is tougher. Hedge fund guys are having a tough time,” says Mr Kelly.But leading business jet makers, Canada’s Bombardier, Gulfstream, Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft of the US, Dassault of France and Embraer, remain confident about the overall prospects for the private aviation industry, buoyed by the demand from markets outside North America.The Honeywell report forecasts record business jet deliveries of nearly 1,200 this year, up from 1,020 last year and rising to between 1,300 and 1,400 in 2009.Jack Pelton, chief executive of Cessna, says: “We have indeed seen the first effects of softening in the US, with used aircraft prices and flight hours dropping somewhat and some inventory growth. However, this is being offset by strong demand in international markets, which now represent 50 per cent of our business, compared with 30 per cent, historically.“Companies and individual buyers in new EU countries, in eastern Europe, and in Russia are buying lots of smaller aircraft, not just the big models they used to focus on. Demand in the Middle East and China is strong, too. Growth will probably slow but there will still be growth.”
241;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-10-01T20:40:32Z;Economic data add to Wall Street gloom;;Another volatile session for US stocks ended in the red as anxiety over paralysis in money markets and a Senate vote on the revised $700bn banking sector rescue package dwarfed even General Electric’s dramatic $15bn capital raising.GE led the declines on the Dow Jones Industrial Average early in the session as its credit default swaps widened. Yet the conglomerate later pared those losses to stand 5.2 per cent lower at $24.18 after it emerged that Warren Buffett would make a $3bn investment.Glum macroeconomic data underlined the parlous state of the US economy, although traders said that the prospect of a vast government intervention to stave off financial collapse took precedence over all other developments.“All these things normally the market would care about,” said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at Voyageur Asset Management. Now, he added, “we care [only] as much as it takes to read a headline”. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.2 per cent but later clawed back to close 0.5 per cent lower at 1,161.06, ahead of the Senate vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent at 10,831.07 while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.1 per cent at 2,069.40.Still, the moves were tame by recent eye-popping comparison. Stocks’ biggest rally for six years in the previous session followed their biggest sell-off for more than twenty.Industrials, down 2.6 per cent, led the market declines after a gauge of manufacturing activity – the economy’s silver lining this year – contracted further in September, falling to its lowest level since October 2001. The level is historically associated with a recession in the broader economy.Caterpillar and Honeywell lost 4.5 per cent at $56.95 and $39.68 respectively.A slew of other economic data – from job losses to mortgage applications – also hurt sentiment.Meanwhile, an oil price decline afforded the automotive sector scant comfort. Nor did news that President Bush had approved a $25bn package to help the sector. Ford sank 12.5 per cent to $4.55 after warning that US sales fell 34.6 per cent in September, to its weakest level of the year. It also said second-half profit at its European unit would be hit by falling demand and rising raw material costs.General Motors fell as much as 4.76 per cent but later recovered to stand 0.2 per cent higher at $9.47. Light vehicle sales fell 16 per cent in September.Financials and consumer staples, were the only sectors to enjoy rises of more than 1 per cent. Telecoms and utilities also inched into positive territory.Regional banks continued their recovery from Monday’s brutal sell-off. National City and Fifth Third leapt 65.1 per cent at $2.89 and 16.1 per cent at $13.82 respectively, the former helped by takeover speculation.Citigroup rose 12.1 per cent to $23.Energy stocks, which rallied in the previous session, lost 1.7 per cent as oil prices fell. Peabody Energy led the declines, down 8.8 per cent at $41.05.Airlines soared as crude-oil prices fell below $100. Delta Airlines, for example, added 14.8 per cent at $8.55.Among technology stocks, down 2.2 per cent, IBM was particularly hard hit. It fell 5.8 per cent at $110.13 on fears that the Dow component may have missed its third quarter profit targets.Elsewhere, Boston Scientific and Medtronic fell 7.6 per cent to $11.34 and inched down 0.2 per cent to $49.83 respectively after a court ruled that the pair had to pay $629m in interest to Johnson & Johnson down 2.2 per cent at $67.79. That took its total award in an 11-year patent case to $1.2bn.Ingersoll-Rand and Parker Hannifin fell 5.5 per cent to $29.46 and 3.6 per cent to $51.09 after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the two groups from “buy” to hold”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the fear gauge, inched up 0.5 per cent to 39.59, indicating extremely high levels of distress.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 1.5 per cent. Earlier in the session, it fell back below the level set when the ban was introduced last month but later recovered.Wal-Martlost 0.4 per cent at $59.66 after the retailer said it would cut prices on popular toys ahead of Christmas.
242;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-07-28T18:00:39Z;Antitrust explosion;;General Electric and Honeywell may both be US companies, but when they tried to merge in 2000, it was the European Commission, not the US Department of Justice, that raised competition concerns. Soon it may be India or China that blocks a high-profile global deal. Tough antitrust laws set to come into effect in both countries are good news, but if deals are not to be reviewed to death, competition authorities must defer to a lead regulator in the jurisdiction most affected.Two trends have intersected in antitrust. One is the rise of China and India, not just as manufacturers, but as important markets in their own right. The other is the rise of giant cross-border takeovers. It is now as likely as not that if two car companies decided to merge, it would affect competition in dozens of national markets, not just in their respective home countries.Every nation has a right to make its markets competitive. But if every country looks at every deal, then not only will the increased bureaucracy mean cost and delay, but the country with the toughest antitrust interpretation of a particular transaction will make a de facto decision for everybody else. That is sometimes a concern already, and given that companies may only need sales of $100m in India or China to be scrutinised, the situation could become much worse.That is not a criticism of the new competition rules in either country – both are modernising laws on which the legal profession has been consulted. If enforced both promptly and evenhandedly, strong antitrust laws will mark a step towards competitive capitalism, rather than crony capitalism, in both countries. Local consumers will benefit.On international deals, however, China and India (and the US and European Commission) should leave mergers to the one jurisdiction best placed to handle them. If a merged company would have $200m sales and a 5 per cent market share in India, but $10bn sales and a 30 per cent share in the US, it is obvious who should take the lead. A forum to co-ordinate regulators – the International Competition Network – already exists. China should join it.The precedent to avoid is the 1997 deal between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas – which triggered a clash between EU and US competition authorities. That merger almost sparked a transatlantic trade war before the EU stepped away, and if China or India were seen to use competition law to advance political aims, the result would be similar. If they can co-operate with the rest of the world’s competition authorities, however, the Asian giants will be most welcome in the antitrust club.
243;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-07-22T15:58:08Z;Wall Street dispatch: Goldman magic conjures up many a financial lunch;;"Repetita iuvant. Repetition helps – or so the Romans thought; but the truth of that Latin saying is a lot less apparent to anyone who writes about finance.Among the sort of meetings journalists attend, lunch or a drink with a banker is usually a rewarding experience – the guys and gals in the pinstripe suits tend to be smart, sharp and rarely short of an opinion.But, as if it to prove the theory of free lunches, the joy of those encounters is almost always tempered by some tedious rituals.Whether you are munching a sandwich in the City of London, drinking in Hong Kong or finding out the new meaning of the words “large steak” in a Wall Street eaterie, it is a fair bet that your banker companion will launch into one or both of the following monologues.First, a peroration of how their firm’s recent successes – there are always some recent successes to celebrate – are due to its “customer-centricity”. (A slight variation involves referring to recent changes in management/structure/strategy – there are always recent changes in banks – as instrumental in “really getting close to our customers”.)The second refrain is more entertaining but no less futile: a rant of variable length about the alleged sins of the firm that rivals love to hate, Goldman Sachs.The specific topics change but the underlying message is constant: Goldman’s repeated ability to outdo its competitors is either due to some mysterious formula they should be forced to disclose (“the Coca-Cola argument”) or to the company’s far-reaching connections with regulators and politicians (“the Manchurian Candidate argument”).In the US, these conversations have become all the more frequent of late, as Goldman’s alumni have spread their wings.Former Goldman executives run the Treasury, the state of New Jersey, a large investment bank and, since a fortnight ago, one of the top five lenders in the US.Not bad for a group of people who, according to Goldman’s own lore, struggle even to contemplate life outside the hallowed firm.The employability of the former inhabitants of the House of Goldman has increased their competitors’ dark mutterings about the company’s takeover of the financial sector, Washington and – why not? – the world.Now, I love a conspiracy theory as much as the next man, but I cannot join the tut-tutting brigade on this one.Putting aside value judgments on Goldman’s business tactics and corporate culture, there is no denying that its franchise has been built on a mixture of competence and aggression.The credit squeeze, with its glum appendix of sackings and premature retirements, has shown just how many rival banks tried and failed to get that balance right. Given the litany of errors by just about every other bank, is it really that tragic, or strange, that a portion of the financial ruling class hails from one of the healthier institutions?Don’t get me wrong. I am not advocating handing Goldman and its acolytes the keys to the world’s capitalist system.But I do think the fact that former Goldman people are in positions of power should not cause investors and rivals too much sleep deprivation.After all, not many people fret about a “GE-ification” of corporate America even though former General Electric managers run the likes of Boeing, Chrysler, Honeywell and the media group Nielsen.The issue is not whether it is a good thing for the financial system that John Thain, Goldman’s former president, runs Merrill Lynch, or Robert Steel, Goldman’s hitherto head of equities, just moved from the US Treasury to head Wachovia, the regional bank.On paper, their achievements, résumés and experience should make them good candidates to keep those troubled firms on the straight and narrow.The real question is whether they will be any good at it in practice. Or, put another way, whether you can take the man out of Goldman without taking Goldman out of the man.Take Mr Thain’s situation.Unless he can right Merrill’s quickly and stop the capital leakage, he could soon face the prospect of having to sell the firm.Admittedly, bidders are unlikely to move until equity and debt markets stabilise, but Merrill’s senior executives must know that time is against them.There is little previous experience that can prepare an executive for a challenge of this magnitude.Mr Steel, if anything, faces an even sterner task: translating his experience of capital markets, investment banking and government into a successful strategy for an ailing lender.Moving to a different industry – and commercial banking is different from investment banking – is not easy.Just ask Alan Mulally, the former Boeing executive who has not yet been able to make Ford profitable, or Bob Nardelli, the GE high-flyer now grappling with a financial and operational crisis plaguing Chrysler.Here is a suggestion for my next lunch conversation with a Wall Street luminary: let’s skip both the conspiracy and the theories and opt instead for a saner chat on whether the Goldman magic really exists, and can help the stumbling financial system find its footing.francesco.guerrera@ft.com"
244;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-07-07T23:43:04Z;Stephen Howard: Shift in climate for responsible companies;;Stephen Howard has been chief executive of Business in the Community for barely six months, but he is fizzing with ideas for pushing forward the corporate social responsibility agenda. The economic forecast is cloudy, and many of the organisations that have been pillars of the responsible business community are dealing with the fallout from the credit crunch. But Mr Howard remains confident that member companies will see the strategies developed through BITC as part of the solution to their current woes.“It’s inevitable that companies will be much more cautious on how they spend their money,” he says. “Less will go into traditional charitable causes, as in previous downturns. But I believe companies will realise that, in a decline, how they relate to their employees and their communities becomes more important than ever.”That is not to say that BITC can avoid change, says Mr Howard. “We’ve had a successful 25-year run, and the whole business responsibility agenda has matured in that time.“It is more competitive and there is greater sophistication in companies – which means we need to do more. The question is: how do we raise the bar for companies in a collaborative way, without duplicating what’s already out there?”In recent years, the focus at BITC has been on business responses to climate change. That is not about to change, but Mr Howard is keen to develop a new theme – the talent challenge – where he sees a vital role for business in developing the skills of employees and the wider community.“If Britain doesn’t get a hold of this issue, other countries will,” he warns. “Unlocking talent is an issue for the country.”From its earliest days, BITC has focused on aspects such as raising education standards and skills, and drawing on untapped pools such as women, ethnic minorities, the homeless and the unemployed. Now Mr Howard wants to draw these elements together with what he calls a “talent map”, setting out seven points of intervention.They include supporting literacy and numeracy in schools, encouraging staff to become school governors, tackling the large residue of functionally illiterate and innumerate adults in the workforce and bringing Neets – young people not in employment, education or training – into the world of work. At the top end of the skills scale, there is still more to do to bring out the best in people, he believes.“Business has a unique and powerful role to play, collaborating with partners to improve the system, providing volunteers to support other organisations and devising initiatives to raise the country’s performance.”Mr Howard, born in the US and a lawyer by training, has spent most of his working life in business. He spent almost 20 years with Cookson, the engineering group – finally as chief executive between 1997 and 2004. He then became chief executive of Novar, a struggling industrials group that was sold in 2005 to Honeywell. He joined BITC, as a director responsible for operational aspects of the organisation, in 2005.The organisation he now leads has 800 member companies, but he is keen to extend its reach.One group in his sights is the private-equity houses and the businesses they own which now employ around one in five people in the private sector.BITC has around 10 private-equity firms in membership, and is aiming to raise that to 20 by the end of the year. “The private-equity firms realise they are under greater pressure than before, which was why they adopted the transparency code recommended in Sir David Walker’s report. They recognise there is hostility to them.”One option would be specific awards for private equity. “We need to gently coax them into a more public stance – the private-equity culture tends to say ‘Let’s stay below the horizon’.”He also wants to do more with small and medium-sized enterprises. He has been working with the large law firms and the Law Society, for example, to provide guidance to help smaller legal firms reduce their carbon footprints.The overriding aim for Mr Howard is to keep BITC as the first port of call on corporate social responsibility, and to stay business-led.“We are not part of government or a non-profit. But there is much more we can do to increase our impact on society.”
245;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-06-29T19:00:18Z;Wagon to brush aside protest by investors over its rights issue;;Wagon is expected to sweep aside criticism from small retail investors at its annual meeting on Monday over its 10-for-one rights issue and to push ahead with its refinancing plan.The car parts maker has seen its share price fall from 263p to less than 4p over two years. The rights issue announcement on June 4 prompted a fall that day from 14½p to 6p.Wilbur Ross, the US leveraged buy-out specialist dubbed the King of Bankruptcy, is underwriting the issue, priced at 4p. Mr Ross holds 15 per cent of Wagon’s stock.The company, which supplies components for Ford, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Fiat, Audi and Mercedes Benz, has also attracted the interest of Philip Falcone, the US hedge fund manager nicknamed Midas of Misery, who has a 10 per cent stake through Harbinger Capital Partners.Another US hedge fund, Contrarian Capital Managment, also has 15 per cent of Wagon.Wagon needs the £49m of new equity from the rights issue to provide capital to back contract wins with Honeywell, Porsche and Iveco, the truck group.News of the rights issue coincided with results that saw pre-tax losses fall from £99m to £1.9m in the year to March following new contract wins. However, financing costs rose from £11m to £13.3m as net debt rose to £107m. The company has renegotiated €155m (£122m) of banking facilities.Adrian Howard-Jones, a long-term investor in Wagon, has criticised the company for, in effect, forcing a dilution of smaller shareholders’ interests.He says the 10-for-one ratio goes far beyond the norm. With his stock worth £1,400, he needs to spend a further £14,000 to maintain his stake.Daniel Pepper, another investor in Wagon, said: “Smaller investors appear to have been disadvantaged. For institutional investors to take up the rights is small beans. But small investors appear to be poorly treated.”Nevertheless, Mr Pepper, who recently bought 250,000 Wagon shares at 14½p, doubled his holding on Friday when the shares fell below 4p, in the hope of a long-term recovery in Wagon shares.Mr Howard-Jones has taken his complaints to the Financial Services Authority and the UK Listings Authority.The rights issue, handled by Hoare Govett, required the approval of the Takeover Panel as it could leave Mr Ross’s companies with majority control of Wagon.Wagon said this weekend: “We understand the frustrations held by shareholders concerning the value of shares to date. But it’s absolutely the right way forward for the company.”It said the issue would end the uncertainty over the company’s finances, which was the reason for the falling share price.
246;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-05-19T22:11:03Z;Interest in UK is far from running out of steam;;It is more than 230 years since the British-developed steam engine kicked off the global industrial revolution – and companies such as Spirax-Sarco are still world leaders with steam control systems used across many industries.But the Cheltenham-based specialist is among a dwindling band of UK-quoted engineers – many of which have fallen prey to US takeover in the past decade.Enodis looks set to be the latest to end up in US hands, though the protracted battle for the catering equipment maker took a further twist on Monday as Manitowoc, based in Wisconsin, returned to the table to trump a previously agreed offer from Illinois Tool Works with an offer valuing the company at £1.08bn.Expro International, the oil services company, is the subject of an approach from Halliburton of the US, which could lead to an offer that gazumps an agreed £1.8bn bid including £200m of debt from a Candover-led buy-out consortium.Such deals follow a developing tradition of US groups swooping on UK rivals. In 2004, UTC bought fire protection specialist Kidde for £1.4bn and Danahar beat off US peer Illinois Tool Works to buy printing equipment maker Linx for £85.7m. A year later, filtration specialist Domnick Hunter was bought by Parker Hannifin for £250m after US rival Eaton Corporation withdrew from the ring. In 2006, crash-test dummy and sensor maker First Technology was bought by Honeywell for £290m following a tussle with Danaher.Deals have typically been at substantial premiums – a pattern that has continued, with the competing offers for Enodis pitched at more than double the level of its 52-week low of 124¼p.David Larkam, longstanding analyst of the engineering sector at Arden Partners, blames scant analyst coverage of the dwindling UK market. This, he argues, perpetuates the relatively low valuations of UK engineering companies, some of whose p/e ratios struggle to get into the double figures – making them ripe for opportunistic takeovers.Ulf Henriksson, chief executive of Invensys, one of the UK’s biggest engineering groups, says US takeovers can make sense – especially from a management point of view. While some European and UK engineering companies tend to act more as “holding companies”, US rivals can be more operationally focused, seeking synergies and quick integration of acquired companies, he says.“A major difference is on getting things done and not waiting for tomorrow – making sure things are happening – directness, with not necessarily politeness or niceness.”In return, an acquired UK company, like other European targets, can offer a springboard to global expansion for a US group.“A US company has the scale – but not necessarily expertise – on how to act globally,” Mr Henriksson says. “European companies can relate better to emerging markets – Europeans have a better start here.”So expansive have some of the Britain’s remaining independently owned engineers become that it is hard to describe the likes of Invensys, Charter, Spirax-Sarco and Weir Group as truly British, observers say.“[Many British engineering] companies are international now,” Arden’s Mr Larkam says. “The percentage of business they have in the UK is pretty small.”So does it matter, then, if the numbers of quoted UK engineers are in decline?Although the CBI has no detailed data on what proportion of UK manufacturers is domestically or foreign-owned, the UK has emerged as being relatively successful at attracting foreign investment compared with other European countries, says David Wilkinson, senior policy adviser on manufacturing at the CBI.A fall in the numbers of London-listed companies does not reflect a decline in the strength of British manufacturing and engineering, Mr Wilkinson says.“Britain has achieved manufacturing value-added growth of 31 per cent since 1990,” he says. “People talk about a decline in manufacturing, whereas manufacturing has only declined in its share in national income because of service sector growth. UK manufacturing is not in distress – it’s a growth sector.”
247;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-05-08T21:46:50Z;ITW in agreed counterbid for Enodis;;Illinois Tool Works launched a counterbid for Enodis on Thursday, disrupting what had appeared to be a done deal with Manitowoc, its US rival.The catering equipment maker recommended an offer of 282p a share from ITW, including 2p in lieu of dividend – 12p higher than the amount it advised its shareholders to accept two weeks ago. The offer values Enodis at about £1bn, more than double its market capitalisation on April 8, the day before it first came under offer from Manitowoc.Enodis is the latest engineer to be involved in transatlantic takeover talks, with Expro, the oil and gas technology specialist, likely to be bought by Halliburton, and First Technology, the testing specialist, sold to Honeywell in 2006.David Speer, chairman and chief executive of ITW, said: “It’s a full price, which we’re offering because it will help us compete in the global food equipment market.”Manitowoc said it was considering its position, with some analysts not excluding the original bidder to come back, or another company to join the fray.“It would be most unusual for a first offer to be pitched at the upper limit of what an offeror is ultimately willing to pay,” said Mike Blogg of Arbuthnot Securities. “Like many British engineering companies, this is a focused company with international market leadership, which is something people pay for.”Enodis shares closed up 44¾p to 288¼p, an 18 per cent jump and well above ITW’s offer price. ITW was up slightly in midday trading in New York. Manitowoc was up 4 per cent.Enodis has long been seen as a takeover target as it has expanded its US operations. Middleby, another US engineering group, was the first to table an offer in May 2006, which was rejected at £800m.It has also been seen as a potential target for other groups including UTC of the US and Sweden’s Electrolux. Aga, the maker of exclusive range fires, also proposed a cash-and-share offer before selling its industrial equipment division.ITW management said it did not expect to run into regulatory issues, unlike Manitowoc whose original proposal to Enodis floundered over concerns anti-trust regulators would force it to divest assets.The ease of the deal was mentioned by Peter Brooks, Enodis chairman, who said the board had given its unanimous support to ITW’s approach. “This higher offer underlines the regard that Enodis has built in the global food service industry.”
248;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-05-01T19:22:21Z;Corporate US faces changing shopping habits;;Corporate America has been dealing with the damage done by the mortgage crisis and resulting credit crunch since last year, with the effects spreading gradually across consumer companies ranging from Tiffany, the jewellers, to Starbucks and General Motors.Yet the economic slowdown has not been bad news for everyone, reflecting both behavioural shifts among US consumers and the advantages enjoyed by those companies that are less reliant on the US domestic market than most of their rivals.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has a mass discount business that is focused on low-income consumers, who have been the hardest hit by rising fuel prices and tightening credit.But its sales have outperformed other mainstream retailers, including the department stores JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s, and Target, its more upmarket discount rival. Its shares have risen more than 30 per cent since October, to hit their highest levels for four years.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, this week offered investors data supporting the view that the retailer was benefiting as more affluent customers were “shopping down”. He said traffic at the hundreds of Wal-Mart stores classed as “affluent” – serving households with incomes in the $55,000-$75,000 range – had increased in March 2.3 percentage points above the average for the entire 3,500 store network.“We are capturing our customers from the more affluent segments,” he said.He noted that Wal-Mart’s customers overall were increasingly using cash, rather than credit. The trend continued even in the run-up to Christmas last year, when the share of credit would traditionally increase.Wal-Mart’s credit receipts in February and March, fell almost 6 per cent, compared with the same period in 2007.“People don’t have as much access to credit as they used to and clearly that is having an impact on how consumers behave,” he said.“This isn’t that people have decided that they can’t spend more, but they have gone beyond their ability to get any more credit . . . they’ve topped out,” he said.Frank Badillo, chief economist at consultants TNS Retail Forward, says there is increasing evidence in the US of shoppers responding differently to economic pressures in their shopping habits. The upper income shoppers are increasingly likely to go to a discounter such as Wal-Mart to buy their preferred brands, while low- and middle-income shoppers opt for store brands that cost less.“The upper income shopper is more likely to stick with brand buys but is more likely to shift shopping channel,” he says.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, suggests that is a factor in the continued strength of its leading brands such as Pampers and Tide.The only other bright spots on the corporate American landscape are those companies with large export markets, which are helped by the weak dollar, and those exposed to booming sectors, such as energy and mining, and emerging markets.In contrast to this week’s warning from Michelin, its European rival, Goodyear, the US tyremaker, reported strong first-quarter profits as the weak dollar boosted exports.Other strong quarterly performance came from Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of bulldozers, and Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, which were also buoyed by strong demand from overseas.Meanwhile, Kraft, the largest US food brand company, is trying to hold on to customers by producing smaller versions of its pizzas and deli meat packages at lower price points – traditionally a tactic used by consumer brands building market share in the developing world.
249;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-04-18T20:48:26Z;Wall St rises sharply ending week higher;;"Wall Street stocks cantered towards the weekend break, climbing for a fourth straight session on Friday after Citigroup posted first-quarter results that were worse than some expected but better than many feared and Google impressed investors with resilient earnings.The biggest US bank posted its second quarterly loss in a row on writedowns of about $12bn. Revenue fell by almost half, but that was better than a number of analysts had forecast.During the past year Citigroup shares have lost more than half their value amid a slew of writedowns, but on Friday they clawed back 4.5 per cent to $25.11 and were 7.5 per cent ahead for the week. Other financial stocks rallied on the news. Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent to $38.56 and Lehman Brothers added 4.3 per cent to $45.50. The S&P 500 financials index gained 1.8 per cent on the day and 5.2 per cent for the week.Google also made ground. Overnight, the internet search company delivered revenues and earnings well ahead of estimates for the first quarter thanks to overseas growth. Google surged 20 per cent to $539.41 as a number of analysts significantly raised target prices for the stock, citing the company’s ability to skip past signs of a US slowdown.Stocks eased off their highs towards the close but the benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.8 per cent at 1,390.34 on the day and 4.3 per cent ahead for the week – its best finish since February.The Nasdaq Composite added 2.6 per cent to 2,402.97 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 12,849.36.Positive earnings reports from a number of large US corporations this week helped soothe fears a US economic slowdown would hit profits, sparking a broad-based market rally and sending measures of volatility to their lowest levels this year.Technology companies have led the way. On Tuesday Intel, the semiconductor titan, offered a ray of hope to the beleaguered sector with solid results and upbeat forecasts for the full year.That news was followed by sturdy earnings reports from Ebay and IBM. Over the week Intel rose 6.2 per cent to $22.55, Ebay added 2.7 per cent to $31.71 and IBM rose 7.2 per cent to $124.40.Industrial stocks found momentum this week on the back of strong earnings
from conglomerates such as United Technologies, CSX, and Textron.Those results reassured investors that diversified international companies can find growth abroad to offset soft domestic markets, and they helped overturn losses in the sector triggered by disappointing results from industrial bellwether General Electric last Friday.Upbeat results from Honeywell International and Caterpillar on Friday bolstered that rally, pushing an index of industrial stocks up 4.7 per cent for the week.Honeywell added 6.3 per cent to $60.99 on Friday while Caterpillar shares rose 8.5 per cent to $85.28.During the week UTC, CSX and Textron climbed
4.3 per cent to $72.51, 8.8 per cent to $61.24 and 6.7 per cent to $60.97 respectively.In spite of a series of massive losses and writedowns begun by Wachovia on Monday and capped by Citigroup on Friday, financial stocks for the most part performed well this week.The run began on Tuesday after a handful of regional banks, including Regions Financial and M&T Bank, cheered investors with
better-than-expected results.Those results were followed by mostly inline earnings reports from JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch.Investors responded positively, sending JPMorgan shares up 7.6 per cent to $45.76 and Merrill shares up 8.4 per cent to $47.35 for the week. But analysts were wary, pointing to “problem” assets, a slowing economy and the rising costs of funding as potential headwinds.Analyst are also sceptical about equity market resilience in the face of macro- economic data showing weakening growth, rising inflation and continued distress in the capital markets.“To us, the Pollyanna-ish calm expressed by the equity market relative to the grim reality displayed in numerous credit-market indicators is a source of constant difficulty,” said Rob Carnell of INGMany believe expectations of about 7 per cent earnings growth from S&P 500 companies excluding financials remain far too optimistic.The sector for which forecasts remain highest however was the leading gainer during the week. Energy stocks rallied strongly, up 7.7 per cent, on the back of record high oil prices.BJ Services and Baker Hughes led the sector, climbing 16.3 per cent to $33.21 and 12.5 per cent to $80.80 over the week."
250;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-04-18T13:36:58Z;Strong aircraft sales boost Honeywell;;Honeywell, the diversified industrial manufacturer, on Friday reported earnings up 22 per cent on higher sales of aircraft and building controls.The company’s earnings beat analysts’ expectations, and it also raised it earnings forecast to the high end of its previous range.The company said earnings rose to $643m, or 85 cents per share, from $526 million, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue was up 11 per cent to $8.9bn.Honeywell already had the most bullish earnings forecast for 2008 in the sector, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial had expected net income of 82 cents per share on sales of $8.73bn.“We remain confident in Honeywell’s outlook despite tougher global economic conditions,” said Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chairman and chief executive.Orders for commercial aviation and business jets lifted sales in its aerospace division, which made up 35 per cent of the company’s revenue last year.Earlier this month Honeywell said that it had won a $23bn contract to supply Brazil’s Embraer with engines for its new range of mid size corporate jets. Analysts hailed the contract as a significant victory, opening up future opportunities to supply Embraer, whose airplane engines have previously been largely a stronghold of GE and Rolls Royce.The Automation and Control Systems unit was lifted by demand in global building projects for energy saving devices, such as solar panels.“Our global reach and diversified portfolio of businesses helped to drive organic sales growth across all regions,” Mr Cote said. “We also continue to win major multi-year contracts that support the favorable long-term outlook for our businesses.”Honeywell raised its profit outlook to a range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share and its sales expectations to between $36.8bn and $37.4bn. Previously it said it expected profit of between $3.65 and $3.80 per share on sales of $36.1bn to $36.7bn.Analysts expect profit of $3.76 per share on sales of $36.79bn.Its shares rose $2.52 or 4.4 per cent to $59.92 in premarket trading.
251;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-04-09T02:00:00Z;Honeywell wins Embraer deal;;"Honeywell yesterday won a $23bn contract to supply Brazil's Embraer with engines for its new line of mid-sized corporate jets.The agreement displaces incumbent manufacturers Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney, and marks Honeywell's first jet-engine order from Embraer.Mounting congestion at many of the world's busiest airports, leading to more frequent delays on commercial flights, and the emergence of time-share groups such as NetJets has spurred demand for corporate aircraft.A record 1,138 business jets were delivered last year, up more than 28 per cent from 886 in 2006, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Honeywell said that deliveries would climb to more than 1,300 this year.Embraer's MSJ/MLJ family of business jets, due to begin service in 2012, will fly six to 10 passengers. It has a range of about 3,000 miles, putting most US cities within reach of one another.""This is a great piece of business for us,"" said Rob Wilson, Honeywell's president of business and general aviation. ""This is a workhorse of business aviation.""Mr Wilson said Honeywell would produce several hundred engines a year, beginning in 2011, for a total of about 1,200 planes over the life of the MSJ/MLJ line's production. Aircraft typically stay in production for 10 to 12 years, he said.Most of the wealthy individuals, corporations and time-share leasing companies who buy aircraft with Honeywell engines usually contract Honeywell for maintenance, service and support, Mr Wilson said.Embraer will be the second customer of Honeywell's HRF7000-E engine; Bombardier has used the system in its Challenger 300 planes for the past four years, Mr Wilson said.Honeywell's Phoenix-based aerospace division has also won engine contracts from Gulfstream, Air Tran and Airbus.Bombardier is the biggest maker of business jets, based on the total value of their deliveries.United to codeshare with Aer LingusUnited Airlines, the US airline, and Ireland's Aer Lingus have agreed to book passengers on each other's flights.The deal, set to take effect on November 1 pending government approval, may help both carriers lure more passengers travelling between Ireland and US cities such as Chicago. The so-called codeshare accord will also free customers to accrue and redeem frequent-flyer miles on select flights.United, which operates 3,300 flights a day to more than 200 destinations, is a member of the Star Alliance. Aer Lingus makes 61 US flights a week."

253;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-04-08T20:42:02Z;Wall St falls as results season starts;;US stocks ended a three session winning streak on Tuesday, falling after Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season with a downbeat set of results and Washington Mutual said it had secured a $7bn capital infusion to shore up its capital base.The largest savings and loan company in the US sold shares, at a sizeable discount, to a group of investors including TPG, the private equity firm, and said it would use the proceeds to keep its capital ratios well above required levels.The company also said it expected to report far bigger first-quarter losses than had been expected, would dramatically increase its provisions for bad loans and slash its dividend and 3,000 jobs for good measure.Washington Mutual shares, which jumped almost 30 per cent on Monday on speculation about the deal, fell back sharply on the news. The shares dropped 10.2 per cent to $11.81.That, and a striking report from the International Monetary Fund arguing that financial losses from the US mortgage crisis could hit about $1,000bn, dragged financials lower.The S&P 500 Financials index fell 1.7 per cent, led by Citigroup, which fell 3.4 per cent to $23.76, and Federated Investors, which slid 6.9 per cent to $34.80, hit by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs analysts.The IMF report undercut nascent optimism about the downtrodden sector. Earlier in the day, analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded brokers and asset managers from “neutral” to “attractive”, arguing that mortgage writedowns might “significantly exceed” actual losses.Goldman reiterated its recommendation to “buy” Lehman Brothers shares and upgraded Franklin Resources, Bank of New York Mellon, MetLife, American Express, and Janus Capital.Lehman Brothers fell 2.1 per cent to $43.67 while Bank of New York dropped 0.9 per cent to $42.98 and American Express slipped 0.2 per cent to $46.47.Still, investors found enough resilience to absorb the gloomy minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee which showed some officials were concerned about “a prolonged and severe economic downturn,” as they cut interest rates last month.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said: “The quite negative view of the economic outlook…seems likely, in our view, to trump inflation as a concern and bolsters our view of a 50 basis point rate cut at the end of the month.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,365.54 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,348.76.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3 per cent to 12,576.44.After the close on Monday, Alcoa reported declines in both sales and profits for the first quarter as the company was hit by slowing demand in its home market and rising energy and raw materials costs.The stock slipped a further 0.7 per cent to $37.18, adding to Monday’s 4 per cent decline.Industrial conglomerates also came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut their profit estimates and target prices for the sector, arguing that orderswould fall as the economy weakened.Morgan Stanley analysts cut their 2009 profit forecasts for 16 companies, including General Electric, Emerson Electric and Honeywell, reduced their industry rating to “cautious” and encouraged investors to take profits ahead of potentially disappointing earnings towards the end of 2008.GE fell 0.8 per cent to $36.95 while Emerson dropped 2.4 per cent to $52.10 and Honeywell lost 1.6 per cent to $57.19.A sales warning overnight from AMD, the second largest microprocessor maker, also weighed on the market.The company said it would cut about 10 per cent of its workforce in response but AMD shares fell 4.9 per cent to $6.03.Elsewhere in the sector, Intel dropped 3.1 per cent to $21.08 while Novellus lost 8. per cent to $21.88.Homebuilders fell back after the latest data showed pending home sales fell more than expected in February.Lennar dropped 8.3 per cent to $20 and Pulte Homes lost 5.8 per cent to $14.94.Energy stocks helped cushion falls. Coal companies, Consol Energy and Peabody Energy climbed 4.9 per cent to $78.21 and 5.1 per cent to $59.92 respectively.
254;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-03-05T20:13:04Z;Secret junkets that turn sour;;When Lucent invited Chinese officials to the US, the company acted more like a travel agent than a telecommunications equipment maker, judging by the details of an anti-corruption investigation that closed last Christmas.The US Department of Justice found that Lucent spent more than $10mon about 315 trips for 1,000 Chinese government officials and telecoms executives, most of whom “spent little or no time” at Lucent’s facilities, enjoying instead Hawaii, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Disneyland and Universal Studios.The company paid a total of $2.5m in fines and related civil penalties after co-operating fully with Washington investigators, and says it is glad to have drawn a line under events that took place before its 2006 merger with Alcatel of France. But some US lawyers and executives say that other companies have also organised questionable trips for Chinese officials, in spite of Washington’s recent efforts to clamp down on the practice under its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Patrick Norton, a China legal expert and Washington-based partner at Steptoe & Johnson, a US law firm, says he has been involved in “seven or eight” internal investigations by US companies into training and factory touring trips, one of which has turned into an investigation by the US Department of Justice. “This is a serious problem and it’s one that is almost unique to China,’’ says Mr Norton.The practice indicates how far some US and other western companies may be prepared to go in order to secure business in China. The use of traditional kickbacks has already landed several companies in trouble. Last October, Portland, Oregon-based Schnitzer Steel admitted to paying bribes to steel managers in China and South Korea. The Siemens probe, Germany’s largest corporate bribery case, has also extended to China.The transgressions have allegedly come in two forms. In one, trips have been offered to government officials to curry favour, as in the Lucent case (see below). In the other, the trips have been for employees of client companies, as an inducement to get more business but as part of a contractual agreement in which training and travel costs are included – giving such trips an element of legitimacy. Furthermore, the host company is sometimes instrumental in helping Chinese employees to defraud their own company, since the Chinese companies pick up the bill for the training.In the wake of the Lucent case, US companies admit the issue has moved up the agenda. “The Lucent case has certainly made us very conscious of this problem,’’ says an executive from Honeywell, who asks not to be named. “Preventing this from happening is a challenge for almost any ­company dealing with Chinese ­customers.”One of the main difficulties for foreign companies in China is the blurred line between public and private sectors. The communist government maintains tight control over much of the economy.Stephen Clayton, a senior director in charge of anti-corruption compliance for Sun Microsystems, the technology company, says: “When dealing with companies there, you’ve got to assume that you’re also dealing with the government.”Meanwhile, says Mr Clayton, American executives should also assume that their activities are now under closer monitoring from US authorities. Last year, for example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation created a four-person team dedicated specifically to FCPA cases. Surveillance by the FBI and other agencies has been encouraged by a US administration that has linked corruption to terrorism and increased scrutiny over foreign visitors in the aftermath of the September 11 2001 attacks. “The main reason for all of this is the war on terror,” he says.As an example of how US law enforcers are now infiltrating the corporate world, Mr Clayton recalls a recent industry conference in which one participant started discussing training trips in Hawaii that his company had organised for customers. “They had to do the training, but they almost certainly didn’t have to do it in Hawaii,” Mr Clayton says, without identifying the company. That prompted some questioning from another conference attendee, whom Mr Clayton knew from earlier meetings to be working for the FBI. “This poor guy didn’t have a clue that the woman he was talking to about having people over in Hawaii was an FBI agent,’’ he says.At Honeywell, any US-based training of Chinese client employees is normally limited to a week and kept within a factory location. “We provide them with a very specific agenda to make sure that they only do business-specific activ­ities,’’ says the Honeywell executive. “If we don’t get a proper agenda confirmation, we don’t provide them with the invitation.”Still, Mr Norton says he knows of one case at another company where Chinese trainees asked their US host on arrival to reimburse them almost all the training money paid up-front by their company, since they had no intention of spending their time in America improving their skills. “There was probably two hours of legitimate business over a two-week-long trip to places such as LA and Las Vegas,’’ he says. “And the trip certainly involved many more people than would have been necessary.”Mr Clayton also says Chinese management is not always on top of the financial aspects of training, even though Sun Microsystems has not experienced such problems at first hand. “Whether the [Chinese] company always realises that they are paying too much, I don’t know,” he says. “The people asking for something such as training are in fact not always the most senior in the company. In many ways, my sense is that they are generally ripping off their own company.”That could help convince Beijing it should increase judicial co-operation with Washington – a relationship that remains in its infancy in spite of booming bilateral investments, including those by Chinese state-controlled institutions in Wall Street banks hit by the subprime market collapse.Mr Norton, who has also worked as a legal adviser in the US State Department, says that “there are a lot of people in the Chinese government who honestly would like to clear up such problems, but for now nobody really knows how to deal with the Chinese government on this kind of [training] issue.”While Beijing is still grappling with such problems, the FCPA has already helped reshape US corporate law by, among other things, making an acquirer liable for any past transgressions by the purchased company.Linus Wong, a director at Control Risks, a ­London-based consultancy advising companies on white-collar crime, says: “Due diligence in the traditional sense, in other words just going through some documentations, is probably no longer good enough and would not make a company immune from DoJ prosecution.”So any company eager to follow Alcatel’s example and merge with a US counterpart should take a long, hard look at their American partner’s records – including the guest book.No expense spared: Lucent’s ‘factory trip’ of a lifetimeDetails of the Lucent case released in December suggest the US company went beyond just providing a top-class travel itinerary for Chinese visitors apparently eager to avoid factory tours.Lucent also gave some Chinese officials a daily cash allowance of $500 to $1,000, even though it had paid all lodging, transport, food and entertainment expenses.For one trip, Lucent justified the absence of factory visits by saying that Chinese visitors had been afraid to travel to the east coast following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Lucent’s help also extended to relatives or associates of the invited Chinese officials, who were offered “educational opportunities” both in the US and back in China at a total cost to Lucent of more than $100,000.Trips were typically characterised as “factory inspections” or “training”, but the US Department of Justice pointed out that “by 2001 Lucent had outsourced most of its manufacturing and no longer had any Lucent factories for its customers to tour”.
255;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-03-02T20:24:29Z;Nottingham boffins create fast swimwear;;Speedo, the swimwear company based in Nottingham, has tapped the expertise of the city’s academics to help develop a swimsuit it claims is “the fastest in the world”.A team at Nottingham University took part in an international collaboration to create the LZR Racer suit. This is expected to have high visibility at the Beijing Olympics when swimmers vie to shave milliseconds off their finishing times.The tie between Speedo and a local university is the kind that vice-chancellors, business leaders and politicians would like to see more of in the UK. Britain has historically been good at technological research but mediocre at harnessing it for commercial purposes.Last year, Aqualab, the Speedo research unit that develops clothes and equipment for elite swimmers, recruited Dr Herve Morvan and his team of fluid dynamics engineers. Aqualab’s original collaborator Barry Bixler, a respected US-based Honeywell engineer, had died. His work on modelling fluid flows around the body of a swimmer was incomplete. Mr Morvan and his colleagues were retained to finish the job.They used Computational Fluid Dynamics, a technique more common in the aerospace industry, to identify the parts of the body that cause the most drag as they move through the water. These are covered with panels of low-friction fabric in the LZR Racer suit. Other fabrics used in the suit fulfil other functions, including providing buoyancy around the hips to improve posture in the water, and compressing protuberances, such as buttocks and breasts, to increase streamlining.“It was great to take what I do academically and apply it to sport,” says Dr Morvan, a Frenchman and a keen cyclist.Deborah Yeomans, product development manager at Speedo, says the new swimsuit creates 24 per cent less friction than the Fastskin. This was one of the first high-technology swimsuits, making its debut at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.Last month, Eamon Sullivan of Australia broke the world record for 50m freestyle, wearing an LZR Racer. Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, meanwhile, broke the world record for the women’s 200m back stroke.The crucial test of the suit will be how well its wearers perform in this year’s Beijing Olympics. Swimmers sponsored by Speedo include Michael Phelps of the US, who won eight gold medals at the Athens games in 2004. A good haul of medals would help sales of the LZR Racer, which at a price of €200 (£153) and higher is targeted at serious swimmers. More importantly, it would add to the sporting lustre of the Speedo brand, driving sales of lower-priced swimwear to less Olympian mortals.Speedo ceased garment manufacturing in the east Midlands early this decade, having hung on long after many counterparts. Its swimwear is now made overseas in countries such as Portugal. Very little remains of the garment manufacturing trade that was once the mainstay of the east Midlands economy.Speedo, which this year celebrates the 80th anniversary of its foundation, be-longs to Pentland, the big private clothing brands business based in London. Other Pentland subsidiaries in-clude Berghaus, Red or Dead and Ellesse.Pentland does not break out Speedo’s results in its Companies House filings. The group made pre-tax profits of £23.2m on sales of £933m in 2006, the most recent year for which figures are available.Nottingham University is making a splash with its Speedo collaboration but local rival Nottingham Trent University is no slouch either when it comes to commercialisation efforts.BioCity, its medical technology incubator, expects to open its third phase in the next couple of months, providing laboratory and office space in which successful spin-offs and other start-ups can expand. The £5m expansion suggests sceptics got it badly wrong when they doubted the feasibility of a biomedical cluster outside the academic “golden triangle” of London, Cambridge and Oxford. There are now 50 bioscience companies based at BioCity.The BioCity site consists of a warren of laboratories that were donated to Nottingham Trent by the German company BASF when it withdrew from chemical research in the city early this decade. It was a striking piece of corporate philanthropy. Building and equipping the laboratories from scratch would have cost £25m. The donation echoed the generous funding that Jesse Boot, founder of Boots the retail pharmacist, gave to create Nottingham University.Alliance Boots no longer has its headquarters in Nottingham but still conducts product research there. One spin-off from these activities was Clinphone, a clinical trials business set up by doctors who had conducted clinical trials for Boots and wanted to systemise the process. The company has suffered depressed share prices since a profits warning last year. Last month, it rejected a takeover offer from Parexel International of the US.AstraZeneca is another important asset in the east Midlands life sciences cluster, employing more than 1,000 people at a research and development centre in Loughborough. More than 500 businesses in the region depend on the healthcare industry.
256;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-02-14T19:52:10Z;London shares surrender early gains;;Engineering group IMI was back in focus on Thursday as bid rumours continued to circulate.Earlier this week, its shares rose sharply on talk of predatory interest from a private equity group.The shares jumped again on Thursday amid chatter that Honeywell, the US industrial conglomerate, was poised to make an offer for the Birminingham-based company.There was also speculation that Honeywell had been in the market buying stock.After heavy trading, IMI shares came to rest 6.3 per cent higher at 416p, one of the best performances in the FTSE 250, which rose 93.1 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 10,089.2.Some cautioned that a bid was unlikely to emerge until IMI had filed annual results early next month.Leading shares, meanwhile, surrendered early gains to close almost unchanged.The market went into reverse after Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, warned that US economic growth would be sluggish at best in the near term.Mr Bernanke also said he expected more writedowns from investment banks.The FTSE 100 closed 0.8 points lower at 5,879.3.Property stocks weighed on the index after Goldman Sachs published a bearish note. The broker said it was staying cautious because of fallout from the end of the credit boom.“We see an extended period of muted growth and rising borrowing costs, given that current gearing levels appear demanding relative to pre-1990 levels and providers of finance are unlikely to regain their past appetite in our view,” it said.With Goldman retaining “sell” recommendations on Land Securities and Hammerson, they fell 2.8 per cent to £15.53 and 3 per cent to £10.52 respectively. British Land was also on offer, losing 3.9 per cent to 969p.But HBOS, down 5.1 per cent to 631p, was the biggest blue chip faller as traders realised that the bank had a sizeable exposure to self-certification mortgages.In results released on Wednesday, Bradford & Bingley, the mortgage lender, revealed a sharp increase in arrears. B&B was unable to claw back any of Wednesday’s 23 per cent loss.Its shares slipped 0.3 per cent to 186½p after Morgan Stanley cut its rating and set a 150p target price.With £595m of exposure to risky structured credit products and shareholder funds of just £1.2bn, analyst Mike Helsby said he was worried Wednesday’s disclosures would “hurt B&B’s deposit-gathering capability”.Elsewhere in the sector, Alliance & Leicester slipped 2.8 per cent to 543½p.J Sainsbury provided the day’s speculative focus. Its shares rose 2.6 per cent to 380p on rumours that the Qatar Investment Authority, which already owns 225 per cent of the food retailer, had picked up 22m shares on Tuesday night.Market professionals said the speculation was wide of the mark. They said an investor had switched part of his Sainsbury holding from one broker to another.Rolls-Royce, the aero engine maker, added 1.7 per cent to 429¼p after Cazenove upgraded to “outperform” from “neutral”, citing recent share price weakness.Cazenove said: “With forecasts unchanged since results, and our take on the disappointment of the financial review explained by management conservatism rather than any unexpected change in the outlook for the industry, we consider Rolls-Royce trading on a 2008 price earnings ratio of 11.6 while offering a 3.5 per cent yield as an opportunity.”Lonmin advanced 2.4 per cent to £33.59 after the price of platinum hit another record high. Aquarius Platinum, up 12 per cent to 786½p, was also in demand.Among the mid-caps, Telecity, the data centre operator, was marked 5.6 per cent higher at 245p after strong results from Equinix, a rival.“We believe the Equinix statement, which shows no evidence of a slowdown and raises guidance, should offer reassurance,” broker Landsbanki said.Landsbanki made positive comments about recruitment consultant Michael Page, up 6.3 per cent to 266p. “Unless overseas activity hits a brick wall, we do not see the decline in 2008 earnings that the share price implies,” analyst Ian Jermin said.Vague private equity bid rumours helped push up bookmaker Ladbrokes 2.9 per cent to 321¼p.
257;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-02-11T21:42:03Z;Energy and tech lead gains on Wall St;;US stocks chalked up modest gains on Monday, led by energy and technology companies, helping offset worries about the threat of new turmoil in credit markets.Oil companies attracted buyers as the price of crude reached its highest level in a month and tech stocks were buoyant after Yahoo rejected Microsoft’s takeover bid, raising the prospect of a higher revised offer. Retailers moved higher as traders looked to buy into sector weakness.Insurance companies came under pressure after American International Group dramatically increased its estimate of credit derivative losses, adding to concerns about further writedowns in the financial sector.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,339.12 having fallen 0.8 per cent early on. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,320.06 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.5 per cent to 12,240.01.Yahoo’s board formally rejected Microsoft’s $31-a-share offer as inadequate, threatening to trigger a heated takeover battle.Some analysts said the debate might now be one about price and that Yahoo might find it difficult to reject a higher offer. Microsoft is preparing to target Yahoo’s shareholders directly, the FT reported. Yahoo’s shares rose 2.3 per cent to $29.87. Microsoft fell 1.2 per cent to $28.21 after RBC Capital Markets cut its price target from $40 to $31.In a sign of further consolidation in the tech sector The Wall Street Journal said Motorola and Nortel Networks were in discussions about a possible merger of their wireless infrastructure units. Motorola rose 2.8 per cent to $11.57. Nortel fell 1.6 per cent to $10.89.Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $129.45 after Citi Investment Research added it to a preferred list on valuation grounds. It has fallen more than 34 per cent this year.After a stellar run last year, energy stocks have failed to ignite in 2008, falling an average of 11 per cent, as worries about margin pressures and waning US demand have grown. Peabody Energy enjoyed the best of Monday’s gains, climbing 4.9 per cent to $56.52.Chevron, up 1.5 per cent at $80.43, joined ExxonMobil as a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America was also elevated to the blue-chip average in place of Altria and Honeywell.The changes were the first since April 2004 and are set to apply from February 19. Honeywell, an industrial conglomerate, fell 0.3 per cent to $57.64 and Altria, which is in the process of spinning off its international tobacco business, fell 0.9 per cent to $72.42.Dow Jones’ substitutions reflected the growing importance of oil and gas to the global economy.A broad range of financial stocks remained under pressure as risk indicators pointed to elevated tension in credit markets.AIG’s shares slumped 11.7 per cent to $44.74, their lowest point in almost five years, after the insurer’s auditors found “material weakness” in the reporting of fair valuation of its credit insurance portfolio.“AIG came out and reminded everyone of the continuing problems in credit markets and the financials,” Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, saidHaving updated its valuation model AIG said the gross cumulative value decline in October and November of credit default swaps linked to collateralised debt obligations was almost $5bn, compared with a previous estimate of just over $1bn.Standard & Poor’s cut its equity recommendation on AIG from “buy” to “sell” and Fitch Ratings put the insurer on watch for a possible credit downgrade.The S&P financial index extended last week’s fall of 8.6 per cent, its biggest decline since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, as fears grew that corporate and commercial property defaults were set to rise. Investors were also gripped by worries that the market for leveraged loans – used to finance Wall Street deal-making – is also showing signs of stress.Bank of America Securities cut its first-quarter earnings estimates on US brokers prompting Lehman Brothers to fall 3 per cent to $58.25. Credit card issuers were also battered after Fox-Pitt Kelton cut its rating on the sector. Capital One Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $46.82.
258;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-02-11T19:20:51Z;BofA and Chevron selected in Dow shake-up;;Bank of America and Chevron became the latest companies to be selected for the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index on Monday in the first change to the share market barometer since 2004.The new members to the benchmark, which dates back to 1896, replace shares of Altria and Honeywell from next week.The Dow has been one of the most recognisable equity benchmarks for investors since its inception as a 12-stock average.The Dow set a record close of 14,164.53 last October and is trading at 12,122.71, down 8.6 per cent so far in 2008.Changes in the average are supervised by The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board and this is the first time that the 30-member average has been changed since Dow Jones was bought by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp last year.“The catalyst for these changes is the restructuring in progress at Altria, which will result in a much smaller and more narrowly focused company,” said Marcus Brauchli, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal.Constituents of the Dow are chosen with the aim of making the benchmark representative of the US economy.The Dow has gradually moved away from reflecting just industrial companies but critics contend that it remains a narrow market benchmark. Broader, rival indices include the S&P 500.The average is calculated on the price of its 30 constituents and not their market capitalisation. This means Dow stocks with high share prices carry more weight in calculating the average.The addition of Bank of America and Chevron will raise the weighting of the financials sector from 11 per cent to 13.9 per cent and energy from 5.5 per cent to 10.8 per cent, said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.Bank of America was trading 0.6 per cent lower at $41.93 while Chevron was down 0.7 per cent at $78.73. Chevron was in the Dow from 1930 to 1999.Honeywell was dropped because it is the smallest of the industrials in terms of revenue and earnings, said Dow Jones.The changes mean that the weighting of the industrial sector in the Dow, its largest group, will fall from 26 per cent to 22 per cent while consumer staples will decline from 16.4 per cent to 11.6 per cent, said Bespoke.The Dow was last changed in April 2004 when American International Group, Pfizer and Verizon Communications replaced AT&T, Eastman Kodak and International PaperSince then, AIG has fallen 44 per cent, Pifzer has lost 38 per cent while Verizon is up less than 1 per cent.AT&T subsequently become part of the Dow again in November 2005, through its merger with SBC Communications, which had joined in 1999.
259;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-02-05T23:33:49Z;Picking up the pieces of global M&A deals;;"When it comes to doing deals, bankers and chief executives are experiencing one of the most schizophrenic markets ever seen.The minute one bidder walks away from a deal, citing market difficulties, another announces an acquisition, citing opportunity.From Kaupthing Bank’s last-minute decision to call off its planned €3bn ($4.4bn) takeover of Dutch rival NIBC Holdings, to Blackstone threatening to walk away from its $6.4bn buy-out of Alliance Data Systems, several billion dollars of deals have been axed or shelved as conditions in the credit market deteriorate.But, while some deals are being pulled, others are being created. Just last week, Microsoft launched a $43bn unsolicited bid for Yahoo; Chinalco acquired a $14bn stake in Rio Tinto, and Punch Taverns of the UK approached Mitchells & Butlers about a £4bn merger.Even BC Partners managed to complete its $16.5bn acquisition of Intelsat on Monday after making concessions with its three financing banks on the structure of its $15bn debt.“We currently have a bi-polar market with some deals being pulled at one end of the spectrum, and new opportunities created for cash-rich buyers who sense an opportunity to make acquisitions at attractive multiples at the other,” says Henrik Aslaksen, co-head of European M&A at Deutsche Bank.Despite promising signs of a pick-up in activity, global M&A volume is still far behind levels seen last year.In the year to date, there have been 2,794 deals, with a total value of $236bn – the lowest number of deals since 2005 and the lowest dollar volume announced since November 2004, according to Thomson Financial.“Companies have no doubt in their minds that the competitiveness of the market today requires a global solution, and the underlying rationale for deals has not changed,” says Carlo Calabria, European head of M&A at Merrill Lynch.“However, the question now for companies is at what point do they strike in a falling market,” he adds.Investors have looked to the mining and energy sector for the bulk of deal activity. Vale of Brazil is working on a potential $90bn take-over of Xstrata, the Anglo-Swiss miner. EDF of France and ACS, a Spanish construction group, are considering a joint break-up bid for Iberdrola.“The fundamentals driving M&A in the mining and energy sectors remain very much in place – competition for resources, the benefits of scale, scarcity of opportunity and the need to drive growth. These sectors are likely to remain broadly unaffected by a broader M&A slowdown,” says William Vereker, co-global head of power and European head of natural resources at Lehman Brothers.Non-US acquirers are picking up the slack. “There is a lot of capital outside the US which is likely to be more active in making acquisitions in the US,” says Frank Aquila, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.Global acquisitions by sovereign wealth funds totalled $20.6bn in January – one-third of the total volume registered during 2007. In the US, sovereign wealth fund acquisitions accounted for 28 per cent of total M&A activity last month. However, where sovereign wealth funds are not involved, financing some of the larger deals will remain a challenge. Strategic buyers’ reluctance to enter the takeover fray has been one of the main causes for a recent drop in bank lending.Almost three-quarters of senior loan officers surveyed by the Federal Reserve in January said lower demand for credit was due to a fall in M&A financing, according to a report released on Monday.Even companies on the lookout for acquisitions for some time, such as General Electric and Dow Chemical, have promised to return cash to shareholders through share buy-backs if they cannot find suitable targets at the right price.Some US companies say the conditions are ripe for mid-sized, bolt-on acquisitions. David Anderson, chief financial officer of the US manufacturing giant Honeywell, says the company is looking to use its cash resources for acquisitions in the $100m-$500m range.“In a slowing economy, there are going to be companies that are going to struggle…It could create vulnerability and we are going to be in a position of strength,” he said in a recent interview with the Financial Times.The outlook for private equity also looks difficult. Until last summer, these funds were corporate buyers of first and last resort, acquiring companies with values of more than $30bn.But by the end of last year, investors withdrew from the debt markets, leaving banks sitting on a massive inventory of unsold loans and bonds. Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, estimated last week that $160bn of deal debt has yet to be sold.Mr Hintz predicts US and European buyout activity will drop 30 per cent this year and an additional 22 per cent next year.Yet private equity players still have large cash funds to spend, and as a result, some bankers predict more partnerships this year, whereby buyers seek allies for acquisitions, either for political, financial, technological or strategic reasons."
260;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-01-29T19:51:07Z;Corporate America braced for recession;;Leading US companies are shifting into recession mode and preparing to cut costs, freeze hiring and reduce capital spending as they brace for an economic slowdown, senior executives and industry experts said.Their concerns are likely to be reinforced by the International Monetary Fund, which slashed its forecast for US growth and warned that no country would be completely immune from what it termed a “global slowdown”.Separately, a US study due out today shows that chief financial officers’ views of the economy are the most pessimistic in nearly four years.Business leaders say rising oil prices, sagging consumer confidence and the on-going credit crunch are prompting them to put in place contingency plans to protect against the expected economic downturn.“We have a number of levers we can pull in terms of capital and costs,” said Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical, which reported a halving in fourth-quarter earnings. “We have been buttoned down since July with a total clampdown on costs and capital expenditure.”Jim Owens, chief executive of Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment and a company regarded as a gauge of national economic health, last week warned of “anaemic growth in the US”.Multinationals are counting on growth in overseas demand and the weak dollar to offset domestic weakness.A leading US management consultant said that over the past few months, his firm had been “deluged” with calls from smaller, domestically-focused companies asking for advice on how to deal with a recession.“They all want to know what to cut and what to hold back if the economy hits the buffers,” he said.Chief financial officers polled by Financial Executives International, an association of financial executives, and The City University of New York’s Baruch College, reflected this negative mood about US economic prospects.In the last quarter of 2007, CFOs’ economic optimism touched its lowest level since June 2004, when the survey was first carried out, and recorded a 10 per cent fall over the previous three months.
261;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-01-25T22:06:13Z;Wall St stocks return to negative territory;;Wall Street endured one of its most volatile weeks in recent memory, and closed out the period having just escaped a brief encounter with a bear market.Although the broad benchmarks closed in negative territory on Friday, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to record their first weekly gain in 2008, and break a string of four weekly declines.The S&P fell 1.6 per cent to close at 1,330.61 points, a gain of 0.4 per cent on the week, clipping its overall loss this month to 9.4 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.5 per cent to 2,326.20, for a loss of 0.6 per cent since Tuesday, pulling it down by 12.3 per cent this month. The Dow slid 1.4 per cent to 12,3207.17, that left bluechips up 0.9 per cent this week, a loss of 8 per cent in 2008.At the worst moment for stocks early on Tuesday, the S&P futures contract was 21 per cent below its October peak, meeting the definition of a bear market. The Nasdaq Composite also briefly traded more than 20 per cent below its 2007 high and on Friday was down just over 18 per cent.All this came after the Federal Reserve had sliced its Fed funds rate to 3.50 per cent, a 75 basis point cut nearly a week before its scheduled January meeting. Another cut of at least 25bp is expected.Market volatility surged to levels seen last August as stocks continued to slide, and sectors exposed to the global economy, such as energy, industrials and technology, were hit hard.The Vix index, which measures S&P 500 option volatility surged past last August’s intra-day peak of 37.50 on Wednesday, before it sharply subsided below 30. Late on Friday, Vix was at 29.08.On a closing price level, the Vix has now settled above 30 three times since August. This type of pattern suggests that the market has established a strong ceiling that should hold unless there is a major shock traders say.Then, came the news of a move to help monoline bond insurers that, in conjunction with what traders said, was an extremely over-sold market, helped stem the waves of selling. A proposal to inject capital into the insurers, and thus potentially avert further writedowns among financials, who had purchased insurance, propelled the market sharply into positive territory late on Wednesday.The mood then improved as details of a $150bn fiscal stimulus package from Washington to stave off a recession emerged. The cream on the rebound came in the form of an upbeat earnings report and outlook from Microsoft on Thursday. The tech giant beat fiscal second quarter earnings estimates and raised guidance. The stock, however faded after making a high of $35 in early trade and closed down 0.9 per cent at $32.94.As the mood turned bearish on Frieday, traders said the market may not have escaped the clutches of a classic bear market. “The next two weeks are very critical and will set the tone for the rest of the quarter and a good part of the second quarter,” William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said.He said short covering rather than solid buying had pushed the market higher this week. The cautious tone on Friday also suggested that investors were reserving judgment until next week’s meeting of the Fed and the release of January’s employment report.Mr Strazzullo said that, if the major benchmarks fail to sustain their recent gains, it would mean the market was in the process of moving to much lower levels.He identified 1,150 to 1,350 on the S&P, 10,500 to 12,500 for the Dow and a floor of 1,950 for the Nasdaq as likely new ranges. “If we do not hold in here, there is a risk we see another 10 to 15 per cent washout in the major averages,” he said. This week, Citi lowered its year end target for the S&P to 1,550 from 1,675, and trimmed its outlook for the Dow to 13,950 from 15,100.Among the main S&P sectors, financials led with a rise of 7 per cent this week, and in spite of a 2.5 per cent fall on Friday. The Fed rate cut, with another looming next week, boosted JPMorgan 10.2 per cent to $43.64, while Citi rose 9 per cent to $26.64.Bear Stearns jumped 20 per cent to $87.03. Bank of America said fourth-quarter net income fell to $268m as it reported trading losses of $5.44bn due in part to writedowns of collateralised debt obligations. The stock rose 10.8 per cent to $39.48 this week.Among the bond insurers, MBIA rose 66 per cent to $14.20. Ambac reported a loss of $3.26bn after taking a $5.21bn writedown, but the stock jumped 86 per cent to $11.54, boosted on Friday by talk that investor Wilbur Ross may buy the company.Friday saw the debut of RiskMetrics Group. The provider of risk management and corporate governance products priced at $17.50 and after trading at a high of $24.45, closed at $23.75.In contrast with Microsoft, results from eBay and Apple disappointed investors. Shares in eBay fell 5.3 per cent to $26.83 this week as its 53 per cent rise in profits was accompanied by a 2008 forecast below some estimates.Apple reported a 57 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, but lowered its outlook and fell 19.4 per cent to $130.01.Caterpillar rose 5 per cent this week to $65.93 On Friday the heavy equipment maker said quarterly income rose 11 per cent, buoyed by international growth. But the company expects “recessionary conditions” in parts of the US to persist.Honeywell reported 18 per cent growth in net income, and warned that the global economy would soften. The stock rose 5.3 per cent to $58.25 on the week.In other earnings this week, Hershey said quarterly profit fell almost 65 per cent and the confectionary maker predicted a drop in earnings in 2008. The stock tumbled 7.3 per cent to $34.04.Lockheed Martin said quarterly profits rose 10 per cent and the defence contractor raised its forecast for 2008 earnings. The stock rose 3.5 per cent to $105.49.Ford Motor announced a fourth quarter loss of $2.7bn and a loss of $2.8bn for 2007, as weak US operations overwhelmed stronger international growth. The stock rallied 11.1 per cent to $6.58.Xerox reported a rise in quarterly profit of 79 per cent. While its outlook for the first quarter was partly below Wall Street estimates and the stock rose 9 per cent to $14.46 this week.
262;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2008-01-24T12:14:33Z;Environment: Modest steps on emissions as energy use soars;;With its chaotic, low-tech cities, India is no beacon of green living. But high energy costs and scant domestic supplies are driving more companies to improve energy efficiency.US company Trane, one of the world’s biggest makers of air conditioning and heating systems, says its business in India is growing as hotels, pharmaceutical companies and others make buildings more energy-efficient.Air conditioning accounts for half the electricity bill of an average commercial building, according to Trane. With India experiencing searing heat most of the year, Trane reckons upgrading its commercial buildings can yield savings of 20-50 per cent.India is at the centre of a global debate on how to approach climate change after the Kyoto protocol, the international emissions reduction agreement, expires in 2012.As a developing country it is not set targets to cut emissions. Its energy capacity of 132,000MW for a 1.1bn population compares with US installed capacity of 850,000MW for a 300m population.But India’s energy consumption will at least double between 2005 and 2030 if its economy continues to grow at rates of 8 to 9 per cent annually, says the International Energy Association.This will make India a far larger producer of carbon emissions, and like China, it is under pressure to make stronger efforts to reduce them.Developing countries are hesitant about hard and fast targets for fear of sacrificing growth. But as India tries to forge a national policy on climate change, some steps are being taken to conserve energy and reduce emissions.Much of this is borne of necessity. India imports more than 70 per cent of its oil and gas, and relies on coal for half its power.Although cars are commonly considered the main producers of carbon emissions, buildings account for nearly 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Urban areas are responsible for about 75 per cent of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.In addition to portions of India’s private sector looking to make buildings more efficient, Mumbai is one of 16 cities to agree to retrofit municipal buildings with better technology.Mumbai will provide incentives to private owners as part of a project spearheaded by a foundation headed by former US president Bill Clinton, under which Trane, along with Honeywell, Siemens and Johnson Controls, will perform energy audits and retrofit buildings.“A lot of companies [in India] are asking, ‘How do I reduce my carbon footprint?’,” says Mike Thompson, director of environmental affairs at Trane.India is already home to nine certified green buildings including Olympia Technology Park in Chennai and Hiranandani BG House in Mumbai, which have won gold and platinum LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) ratings from the US Green Building Council.Green buildings accounted for 6,000 sq metres of space in 2003 and should expand to 304,800 sq metres this year, according to the Indian Green Building Council. The group expects demand for green building materials and equipment to reach $4bn by 2010.Broader efforts to reduce emissions may be spurred by new government policies. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, last year convened a council to advise on climate change policy.“Lots of people are under the impression we have not taken action,” says Pradipto Ghosh, a member of the council. To refute this, he cites India’s national energy conservation act and its renewable energy programme.Some industries such as cement have also cleaned up their factories, adds Mr Ghosh, a former secretary of the Ministry of Environment.India could focus on reducing emissions in industry, transport and energy production, says Sanjay Vashist, a fellow at the Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), a Delhi think tank. More incentives for green technology and low-carbon measures, such as public transport systems or clean coal technology, would also encourage action.The question of whether India is doing enough to tackle climate change will continue to be raised. But at the recent UN conference in Bali, where governments began talks on a successor to Kyoto, India was largely silent.Developed countries still produce more emissions per capita and are historically responsible for climate change, says Mr Vashist. “If the international community expects India and China to take up more responsibility, then developed countries must go for deeper targets.”
263;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-12-14T21:39:49Z;Wall St unease about credit squeeze remains;;Wall Street stocks hit reverse gear this week after interest rate cuts and a central bank plan to help ease banks’ funding problems failed to convince investors that the worst effects of the credit squeeze were over.The spectre of inflation returned after both producer and consumer prices rose more than expected, threatening to limit the ability of the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates to stave off a recession.Energy and telecoms groups were among the best performers but financials again felt heavy selling pressure amid concerns about earnings as the fourth quarter results season began.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,467.95 on Friday and ended the week 2.4 per cent lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent this week to close at 13,339.85 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6 per cent over the week to 2,635.74.The Russell 2000 small cap index fell 4 per cent to 753.93 on the week, hurt by a rise in volatility. “The mindset of ‘selling into strength’ has come back into this market,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said.After two consecutive weeks of gains, the major indices retreated amid widespread dissatisfaction with measures announced by the Federal Reserve and other central banks designed to help ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets.Stocks plunged on Tuesday after the Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates 25 basis points, less than many investors had hoped. “It made you wonder about their [the Fed’s] sophistication and their ability to predict what the market reaction would be,” Ms Krosby said.Although equities posted a modest recovery the following day on news of a new term auction facility and foreign exchange swap lines, stocks failed to pare most of their losses with inter-bank lending rates remaining stubbornly high.Investors displeased with the Fed’s response were given a further jolt by data that showed a sharp spike in inflationary pressure.An index of consumer prices rose 0.8 per cent last month, its biggest rise in more than two years. Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy inputs, rose 0.3 per cent, more than expected. The CPI data came a day after wholesale prices rose the most in 34 years.The inflation data may restrict the Fed’s ability to deliver the rate cuts the market wants and equities fell after the news.Citigroup had another bad week after Vikram Pandit’s appointment as chief executive failed to boost its flagging share price. Citi was forced to take $49bn in structured investment vehicle assets onto its balance sheet and and the shares fell 10.5 per cent to $30.70 over the week.Lehman Brothers kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season for the big banks but its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $62.24 on the week, in spite of results that beat Wall Street’s estimates.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bear Stearns report next week. Analysts expect further writedowns in the sector as the value of credit-related assets declines and loan losses increase.Bank of America, down 7.1 per cent at $42.16, Wachovia, 9.6 per cent lower at $39.03, and PNC Financial Services, off 10.2 per cent at $64.81, all made negative noises about current quarter performance. Washington Mutual fell 20.4 per cent to $15.15 on the week after it announced a convertible stock offering to shore up its finances.Investors sought safety in large-cap stocks with strong international sales. AT&T rose 6.9 per cent to $41.14 on the week after the phone company increased its dividend and announced a large share buyback programme.Honeywell put on 2.5 per cent to $59.98 after the diversified manufacturer’s profit guidance pleased traders. 3M guided for double-digit revenue growth next year but the shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $85.93 this week.Microsoft was a standout technology stock rising 2.3 per cent to $35.31 after an analyst at JPMorgan raised his 2008 profit estimates.Retail stocks had a poor week in spite of November sales figures that were twice as high as economists had forecast. Office Depot fell 17.3 per cent to $14.44 after warning of a weak fourth quarter. Costco Wholesale fell 4.7 per cent to $68.49 this week. The S&P retail index declined 7.6 per cent to 410.17 amid fears of a poor Christmas shopping period.The biotechnology sector also had a disappointing week. Biogen Idecfell 21.6 per cent to $58.79 and Celgene lost 12.1 per cent to $50.41. But, BioMarin Pharmaceutical soared 30.2 per cent to $36.44 after it won regulatory approval for a new drug.
264;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-12-13T21:50:27Z;Wall Street climbs after late rally;;US shares delivered a lacklustre performance on Thursday as doubts about a plan by world central banks to help alleviate the worst effects of the credit squeeze weighed on sentiment.Inflation data also fuelled selling pressure before a late rally dragged the major indices higher. The biggest spike in producer prices in 34 years added to concerns that the Federal Reserve might be restricted in its ability to continue cutting interest rates.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,488.41, having traded lower for most of the session. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,668.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 13,517.96 after a big move by Honeywell supported the index.Utilities and industrials performed well but banking stocks endured another dismal session amid concerns about earnings prospects.Shares in Lehman Brothers, which kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season for the big banks, fell in spite of better-than-expected quarterly profits.The shares declined 2.1 per cent to $60.50 after fixed-income revenues dropped sharply and analysts said the inclusion of one-time gains meant the results were not as good as they might appear. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns report quarterly results next week.Washington Mutual fell 2.9 per cent to $15.59 after Bank of America told investors to sell and cut its price target 46 per cent to $13.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, fell 4.1 per cent to $23.84 after it entered a $29bn reinsurance agreement with Assured Guaranty. The S&P financial index fell 0.5 per cent to 399.88.Bank of America, down 0.9 per cent at $43.05 and Wachovia, 0.8 per cent lower at $40.19, contributed to a downturn in sentiment the previous day after they issued negative forecasts for this quarter’s performance.The downbeat sentiment in equities on Thursday was further sparked by a vital index of producer prices, which rose 3.2 per cent in November, its largest gain since 1973 and twice the increase forecast by economists.Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 0.4 per cent, against expec-tations of only a 0.2 per cent increase.“What’s disturbing is really the rise in core inflation,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said. “Everybody was kind of confused about why the Fed reacted the way it did, but now you see the reason.”But the Fed’s plan to tackle a reluctance by banks to lend to one another remained the main focus of investor attention on Thursday. Some analysts said central banks had not gone far enough as interbank lending rates remained stubbornly high.Stocks fluctuated wildly after the plan was unveiled on Wednesday, continuing a recent trend for large intraday price swings. “I think this volatility is going to continue,” said Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at Charles Schwab.The Vix volatility measureis not moving down as much as it normally would when the market rallied. Mr Frederick said: “That’s a sign of fear on the part of market makers. They’re not convinced that any rally we might get on a given day is sustainable.” The Vix was flat at 22.48 on Thursday.Retail stocks were a talking point after retail sales rose 1.2 per cent in November, twice the expected 0.6 per cent increase. The data helped ease concerns about a disappointing Christmas shopping period but the S&P retail index fell.Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, fell 2.4 per cent to $68.54 after an 11 per cent increase in quarterly profit failed to satisfy investors. The shares are up 30 per cent this year.Shares in Biogen Idec, the biotechnology group, slumped 23.7 per cent to $57.91 after efforts at exploring a possible sale yielded no serious offers.Honeywell jumped 5 per cent to $60.65 after the diversified manufacturer’s 2008 profit guidance cheered investors. But Ciena fell 12.1 per cent to $37.04 after the network equipment maker forecast revenue growth to slow in its new fiscal year.JetBlue, up 14.4 per cent at $7.15, provided support to a range of airline stocks after Lufthansa acquired a 19 per cent stake in the low-cost airline.
265;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-11-26T19:27:18Z;Looking the business;;Sandy Dumont is paid by companies to improve how their staff look. The idea is that after a session with the Virginia-based corporate image consultant, they will look nicer and so be better at their jobs. Clients have included companies as diverse as ITT, American Express Financial Services, Rolex and Honeywell.“I do a lot of financial institutions, business schools, anything that’s very competitive,” she says. Americans “recognise that this is another tool for getting ahead. They are willing to pay and do whatever they need to get on the fast track.”A work-related makeover means looking at things like clothes and shoes, make-up, glasses, hair and teeth. Some companies pay for the sessions, especially group ones, but some individuals buy their own one-on-one consultations.In the UK and Europe, business people are a little more coy than Americans when it comes to having their appearance tweaked, says Louise Mowbray, London-based image and personal branding consultant. Nonetheless, they are starting to see the importance of image in a career. “I get a lot of senior people, and for men there is often the sudden realisation that something could be holding them back – and that something could be that they have been wearing the same suit for 10 years.”Staff undergo a work-related makeover for a range of reasons: a promotion that means going out to press the flesh far more often, a job interview, or returning to work after time out.Richard Trevaskis, UK-based sales and marketing director of German industrial piping business Georg Fischer, decided to seek an image consultation with CMB Image. “I do a lot of presenting and go to a lot of meetings. Before, I had just put anything on without really thinking. But dressing properly makes you feel right for the part and far more confident. Ninety per cent of my clients never visit our plants. I’m all they ever see – so for them I am the corporate image.”When the already smartly dressed matrimonial lawyer Ayesha Vardag sought advice from Ms Mowbray, the session allowed her to think about the impression she wanted to convey and incorporate more of her own style into what she wore while retaining a businesslike appearance, says Ms Vardag.Sarah Godwin, co-founder of legal recruitment firm Law Absolute, says an improvement in appearance, even in the supposedly dapper legal profession, is required surprisingly often. “We often make minor suggestions to candidates like toning down eye shadow, taking out nose studs or second earrings, brushing or cutting hair.” Ms Godwin also recalls one candidate needing hygiene advice – she smelt: “I guess she took it because she got the job.”As well as individual consultations for senior staff, CMB Image’s business development manager Audrey Hanna says group sessions can be useful. “Although they are often done as fun team-bonding exercises, they can be an effective way of dealing with problem people who might be offended if you suggest a one-to-one.”It has, Ms Dumont believes, become harder for workers to dress appropriately because of the way sartorial guidelines have shifted. “The dotcom revolution was a terrible thing for dress. It made people feel OK about being sloppy and lazy. And I call casual Friday ‘casualty Friday’. It is an exercise in futility and people look awful.”Ms Mowbray says recent blurring of smart and casual has got those with less than a firm grip on fashion into trouble. While casual in advertising might mean jeans and trainers, it is less likely in investment banking. But there may be situations when lawyers or bankers want to appear less formal – for instance, when dealing with clients in entertainment. There are few firm rules today – except perhaps that shorts are only appropriate for landscape gardeners.Ms Dumont says executives who struggle with choosing clothes or don’t have enough time can seek expert advice. Appearance is important and should be part of the overall preparation for meeting clients. “When you don’t dress appropriately you raise questions about yourself,” Ms Mowbray says. “It takes 20-plus experiences to change an incorrect first impression. You don’t want to put obstacles in front of yourself before you begin.”

All the leading 10 sectors of the S&P 500 were lower this week.Technology groups continued to outperform the market, while financials and consumer discretionary sectors fared worst. Consumer staples performed best – a traditional bellwether of negative economic sentiment. Traders expect continued volatility in share prices. The Chicago Board Options Exchange VIX index rose 28.5 per cent this week to 22.79. “Earnings have been mixed,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said. “The worry is that the US economy has declined more than anticipated.”Bluechip companies led the heavy falls on Friday amid continuing concerns about the outlook for corporate earnings.Caterpillar fell 8.4 per cent at $73.57 on the week after it cut its full-year outlook and warned that a number of industries it serves were in recession.The company added to fears that housing market problems are spreading to other parts of the economy after blaming the weak construction market for a fall in US machinery and engine sales. However, it posted a 21 per cent rise in quarterly profits.3M fell 8.1 per cent on the week at $86.62 on concerns about falling margins on the optical films it sells for LCD television screens. The shares fell even as 3M reported a 7.4 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings and raised its profit outlook for the full year.

Washington Mutual was down 17.4 per cent at $29.09 after its earnings fell 72 per cent in the third quarter. E*Trade Financial, down 21.4 per cent at $10.71, and KeyCorp, 13.1 per cent lower at $28.69, both disappointed investors this week.The S&P financial index declined 7.6 per cent this week at 439.57, while the investment bank index fell 8.7 per cent at 195.86.

267;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-09-23T21:20:12Z;Business jet orders to reach new high;;"Demand for business jets is at a record level and the credit squeeze has so far had little impact on new orders from the world’s executive and wealthy individual high-flyers. Waiting lists for many models stretch to 2010 and beyond.“Industry growth has moved into unparalleled territory,” Rob Wilson, president for business and general aviation at Honeywell Aerospace, one of the world’s leading aerospace systems suppliers, said Sunday.According to the Honeywell annual business aviation outlook, published Sunday, 2007 will mark the fourth successive year of growth since the trough of 2003, with annual business jet deliveries set to exceed 1,000 this year for the first time, up from 861 last year. Deliveries are forecast to rise to more than 1,300 in 2008.Mr Wilson said this was a record year for the industry. “Order intake across most business jet categories remains very strong, with little discernible effect from recent stock market fluctuations. With [order] backlogs exceeding two-and-a-half years’ worth of deliveries, 2008 will likely be another banner year for the industry.”The Honeywell study, one of the most authoritative guides to the fortunes of the business jet industry, had already taken into account the forecast of slower rates of economic growth in the US and the expected impact of the recent turmoil in financial markets, said Mr Wilson.While executive jet purchase expectations have declined a little in North America, traditionally the heartland of the industry, fleet plans have “expanded significantly” in all other regions of the world, according to the report.The arguments in favour of private aviation, such as increased executive productivity, time-saving and the avoidance of congested hub airports, have been gaining support elsewhere in the world.“International buyers now account for about 50 per cent of the new aircraft deliveries projected over the next five years,” says the report.The Honeywell report forecasts sales of about 14,000 business jets in the 10 years from 2007 to 2017, which are worth about $233bn, and which support the delivery plans of the leading makers, Bombardier of Canada; Gulfstream, Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft of the US; and France’s Dassault."
268;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-09-19T17:01:50Z;Kroes rebuffs US on Microsoft ruling;;Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, on Wednesday firmly rebuffed US criticism of the court judgment backing the landmark Brussels antitrust ruling against Microsoft, describing the reaction by a senior US official as “totally unacceptable”.The European Court of First Instance on Monday upheld a 2004 ruling by the top EU antitrust regulator, dealing a severe blow to the US software group in its nine-year legal battle with the European Commission. The court found that the Commission had been right to find Microsoft guilty of abusing its Windows monopoly and backed the sanctions, including the record €497m ($690m, £345m) fine imposed by Brussels.The judgment sparked a negative reaction in Washington, where Thomas Barnett, the head of the antitrust division at the Department of Justice, said: “We are concerned that the standard applied to unilateral conduct by the CFI, rather than helping consumers, may have the unfortunate consequence of harming consumers by chilling innovation and discouraging competition.”Several US lawmakers also criticised the judgment.In an unusually harsh response, Ms Kroes said: “It is totally unacceptable that a representative of the US administration criticised an independent court of law outside its jurisdiction. The European Commission does not pass judgment on rulings by US courts and we expect the same degree of respect.”It is not the first time that the regulators have expressed divergent views on an antitrust case. Six years ago the Commission sparked outrage in Washington when it blocked GE’s takeover bid for Honeywell, an all-American deal already cleared by US regulators.US officials have at various times also voiced their dissent at the Commission’s tough line against Microsoft, though such criticism has usually served merely to stiffen Brussels’s resolve.Most officials and antitrust lawyers argue that Washington and Brussels have bridged their differences in most other areas of antitrust enforcement.
269;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-09-19T03:42:52Z;Microsoft case reveals a regulatory gulf;;Even to seasoned observers of the European Commission’s nine-year antitrust battle with Microsoft, there must have been a strange sense of dislocation as the regulator’s 2004 ruling was finally upheld in court on Monday.Though most of the companies involved in that fight hailed from the US, the judgment was delivered in Luxembourg, drafted by an Irishman and read out by a judge from Denmark. The original Commission ruling was prepared by a Spaniard and handed down by Mario Monti, the Italian EU competition commissioner. He has since been replaced by a Dutch official, Neelie Kroes.Like so many other US companies before it, Microsoft can be in no doubt today that the biggest regulatory threat to its business comes not from the authorities in its home country but from the Brussels-based Commission. Indeed, while the principal US competition authorities – the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission – have been highly reluctant to ­pursue big, dominant companies for abusing their market power, the Commission has repeatedly struck out against corporate behemoths on both sides of the Atlantic.Microsoft is not alone. Two months ago, the Commission issued antitrust charges against Intel, accusing the world’s biggest chipmaker of abusing its dominant position. It is also investigating Rambus and Qualcomm, two other US technology groups. A few years ago, Brussels even dared to go after that most American of companies – Coca-Cola.Though some of these cases have also been pursued through the US courts and examined by American regulators, the centre of gravity for antitrust enforcement has clearly shifted towards Brussels. Following Monday’s resounding victory for the Commission in the Microsoft case, that trend is almost certain to accelerate.Most antitrust lawyers agree that this divergence does not reflect differences in law. Maurits Dolmans, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb in Brussels who acted against Microsoft for a range of other US technology groups, says: “Legally, Monday’s court ruling makes clear that there is no divergence. It is true that the DoJ has been less energetic in pursuing abuses of dominance but that is a question of political choice, and not of legal divergence.”Douglas Melamed, co-chair of the antitrust division at Wilmer Hale in Washington and a former acting assistant attorney-general in the antitrust division at the justice department under the Clinton administration, says two factors have shaped the differing strategies.Mr Melamed says Europeans have a “regulatory culture” that tends to focus more on the set of facts in a case instead of establishing rules that companies use to guide their behaviour – a fact that makes Europeans more interventionist. While the EU puts pressure on companies that seek to exclude their rivals, the US focuses more on efficiency, Mr Melamed says.He says that these conceptual differences will not disappear if a Democrat is elected president in 2008, though he says he believes that Democrats will be more active than the Bush administration’s justice department has been.Stephen Kinsella, a Brussels-based partner at Sidley Austin who represents a pro-Microsoft software association called Act, says the US regulator’s attitude is very different today: “In the US we are seeing very little enforcement when it comes to dominance abuses. You very much see an attitude that says: ‘If you have got yourself into that position, good luck to you.’”However, analysts point out that the EU and US have moved much closer in most other areas of competition law enforcement. The Commission, for example, has emulated its US counterparts’ tough line against cartels, drastically increasing its recent fines for companies that participate in price-fixing agreements.In the field of merger reviews, the two sides have also closed ranks. The dramatic divergence six years ago when the Commission blocked GE’s takeover bid for Honeywell after it had won US approval is unthinkable today.“There has been a general trend towards convergence in a lot of areas, not least because the agencies talk to each other a lot more – and get on well,” says Mr Kinsella.
270;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-09-05T20:50:00Z;Further delays hit Boeing’s 787;;"Boeing has delayed the first flight of its 787 Dreamliner by a further two months, as it struggles to overcome problems in final assembly and in completing the flight control software.The US aerospace group said on Wednesday that in spite of the setback it was still aiming to deliver the first of the new generation of long-haul jets to Japan’s All Nippon Airways on time in May next year.But it admitted that the level of risk in the programme was growing and that the flight test schedule was becoming very compressed.The 787, a new family of medium capacity long-range jets, has been key to
Boeing’s sales success in the past couple of years, as it has again overtaken Airbus, its European rival, in the battle for new orders.Mike Bair, Boeing vice- president and general manager of the 787 programme, said that the first flight for the aircraft, originally planned for August and then postponed to late September, had been further delayed to between mid-November and mid-December.The delay in producing the early test aircraft had added “pressure and some increased risk” to the overall flight test programme, he said.Boeing is aiming to produce six flight test aircraft as well as a further two for the ground-based static and fatigue tests.The delays in the first flight mean that the schedule for the flight test programme has become highly compressed and will have to be completed in about five months, if Boeing is to meet its May delivery date.This compares with the 11 month test flight programme needed for the 777, the last all-new commercial jet developed by Boeing, which entered commercial service in 1995.Originally Boeing had some slack built into the flight test programme, but Mr Bair said the delays were “eating into the buffer”.He said it was eliminating any time to deal with “unexpected” events that might occur in the test programme.“We are rapidly running out of time to deal with anything big,” said Mr Bair. The flight test programme would have to be run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “It is really tight,” he said.Two big issues are delaying the first flight. The amount of unfinished structural work that had been passed on to the Boeing final assembly plant at Everett, near Seattle, from suppliers with incomplete documentation, and delays by Honeywell, one of Boeing’s biggest systems suppliers, in completing the software for the flight control computers.Completion of the big fuselage and wing modules at suppliers had been delayed in part by a chronic shortage of fasteners.The 787 Dreamliner nonetheless looks set to become the most successful new jet launch in history with 706 orders from 48 customers already booked."
271;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-07-20T21:37:20Z;Caterpillar results deepen fears of slowdown;;Caterpillar deepened fears of a US economic slowdown on Friday when it reported a sharp fall in profits, missing Wall Street estimates, due to weakness at its North American operations.The heavy equipment and truck engine maker, a bellwether for the US economy, saw its shares fall nearly 10 per cent during the day, despite recording record sales for the quarter and issuing an upbeat assessment of its international operations.The stock, which had reached an all-time high on Thursday, ended 4.4 per cent down at $83.20, contributing to a 1 per cent slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.The unexpectedly weak performance of Caterpillar’s US operations come amid growing worries that the problems in the domestic housing market could spill over to the rest of the economy.The company admitted the 21 per cent fall in profits was “disappointing” and blamed it on problems in the diesel truck market, weakness in US sales of heavy machinery, higher material costs and continued disruptions to its supply chain.However, the Illinois-based group boosted its forecast for full-year sales, saying that its international operations, which account for about half of its turnover, would grow 25 per cent this year.It reaffirmed its target for full-year profit but said it had “more work to do on costs” and hinted that it might rein back capital expenditure.Caterpillar’s mixed outlook reflects the increasing discrepancy between a slowing US economy and booming international markets.A number of large US manufactures such as General Electric, Honeywell and Whirlpool, the white goods maker that also reported results on Friday, have been relying on exports to offset a slowdown in the domestic market.The US manufacturing sector has been weighed down by a 20 per cent reduction in house building, partly offset by rising non-residential activity, and weak demand in the auto sector.However, analysts said the higher-than- expected June report of the ISM index of manufacturing activity suggested that domestic business conditions were improving, while overseas sales remained strong.In the three months to June, Caterpillar reported net profits of $823m, compared to $1.04bn in the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.24, well below analysts’ expectations of $1.49 per share. Sales rose 7 per cent to a record $11.36bn in the June quarter, with full-year guidance of $44bn at the top end of its existing range.
272;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-07-19T21:24:52Z;S&P 500, Dow close at all-time high;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday as positive sentiment in the technology sector helped investors shrug off fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market.The bullish mood propelled the S&P 500 to a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 for the first time.Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, told US lawmakers that losses from the subprime mortgage market could range between $50bn and $100bn.Leading the major benchmarks was the Nasdaq Composite, with a gain of 0.8 per cent to 2,720.04. One boost for the tech sector was a 12.5 per cent surge to $30.06 in Juniper Networks shares after the networking equipment maker swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, in the expectation that strong sales growth would boost operating margins.Cisco rose 1.7 per cent to $29.94 and had set a 52-week high of $30.So far this year, the Nasdaq’s gain of 12.6 per cent has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the Nasdaq 100 has rallied 16.8 per cent. In a bull market, the more volatile technology stocks led the way as they enable investors to reap higher returns.“It’s no surprise that high beta stocks are doing well in this current rally,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “People who have missed some of the rally, and are forced to chase returns, can get back in the race by buying high beta names.”Another factor in favour of the tech sector is that international sales form a larger proportion of total sales, say analysts. A faster growing global economy in conjunction with a sharply weaker dollar is a fillip for the sector and multinational blue chip companies.But a sour note for techs was struck by Ebay, which fell 1.6 per cent to $33.50, after the online auctioneer posted a 50 per cent rise in quarterly profit, but left its outlook for 2007 unchanged. Investors had hoped for a rise in guidance and also focused on lower global listings.After the closing bell Google reported a 28 per cent rise in second quarter profits that missed estimates as higher costs eroded better-than-expected revenue growth. Google slumped more than 6 per cent in post-market trade.Also after the close, Microsoft met earnings estimates and raised guidance. Microsoft initially rallied in after-hours action, following a gain of 1.9 per cent to $31.51 in regular trade.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices reported a loss in the second quarter as a rise in sales for the chip maker was offset by lower microprocessor prices and costs associated with the $5.6bn purchase of ATI Technologies, a graphics chip maker. In after-hours trade, the stock rallied further after a rise of 2.1 per cent to $15.87 at the closing bell.The enthusiasm for tech stocks lifted the broad market into record territory. The S&P rose 0.45 per cent to 1,553.07 a new record high. Among the major sectors, utilities, technology and energy led gains, while health care and financials declined.Among the financials, Bank of America said quarterly earnings rose 5 per cent with an increase in the provision for credit losses. BofA has now set aside $1.81bn to cover these losses, up from $1.01bn in the second quarter of 2006. Shares in BofA fell 0.2 per cent to $49.27.PNC Financial, a mid-Atlantic regional bank, said quarterly earnings expanded 11 per cent and was also buying Sterling Financial for $565m, or $19 per share. The stock slipped 2.5 per cent to $71.37.Shares in MF Global fell on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MF closed at $27.55, after the financial firm had listed at $30 a share – lower than the expected range of $36 to $39, traders said.The American Stock Exchange Broker-Dealer index fell 0.75 per cent.Another financial stock in the news was American Home Mortgage Investment. The stock plunged 20.8 per cent to $10.76 as subprime worries among investors intensified and the company did not comment on the sharp decline.Blue chips rallied, led by IBM, and the DJIA rose 0.6 per cent to close at 14,000.41.In earnings news, IBM reported a 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit, and raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock gained 4.3 per cent to $115.86 and had set a new five-year high of $116.48.Another Dow stock, Honeywell, posted a 24 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating estimates. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $60.98 and also reached a seven-year high of $61.90 earlier in the day. The company raised guidance for 2007 and also authorised the buyback of an additional $3bn in stock.Shares in Foot Locker surged 8.6 per cent to $22.71, after the company said it would consider putting itself up for sale. The shoe retailer recently failed to buy rival Genesco.In other earnings, Motorola recorded a quarterly loss amid lower revenue from weak phone sales. Shares rose 1.2 per cent to $18.22.Union Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The railroad slid 0.1 per cent to $125.74.Hershey reported a 96 per cent drop in profits for the past quarter, as the confectionary maker invested in transforming its production lines. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $48.45.Harley Davidson reported a 19 per cent rise in profit and reaffirmed guidance for 2007. But domestic sales of motorcycles fell and the stock slid 2.9 per cent to $59.37.Investors will focus on earnings from two DJIA stocks, Citigroup and Caterpillar on Friday. Citi fell 0.9 per cent to $51.14, while Cat rose 0.9 per cent to $86.42 on Thursday.In economic news on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed survey reported a drop to 9.2 in July from a reading of 18 in June. The six-month outlook index rose 30.4 in July from a reading of 16.7 in June.Economists at Bear Stearns said: “This is a stronger report than suggested by the headline sentiment index.”Later this afternoon the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting in June are released.Earlier in the day, leading indicators for June fell 0.3 per cent, more than a forecast decline of 0.1 per cent.“Housing continues to weigh, a theme that ties in with the concerns Bernanke stated yesterday [Wednesday],” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “However, despite the decline, the trend in the overall index appears to have stabilised after declining early 2006 to a cyclical low in early 2007.”Stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but did pare the worst of their earlier losses.
273;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-07-19T14:28:47Z;Wall St lower on poor earnings;;A combination of disappointing earnings and guidance, renewed worries over financials and cautious remarks on the outlook for the economy from Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, roiled Wall Street on Wednesday.Stocks pared some of their earlier losses late in the day, and the S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent lower at 1,546.19. Just three of the main 10 sectors in the index rose. Energy stocks were boosted by oil prices to 11-month highs and utilities also rose as Treasury bond yields fell on safe haven buying amid renewed jitters over subprime mortgages and hedge fund exposure.Leading the declines among the S&P sectors were financials, technology and telecoms.Financials floundered after Bear Stearns said late on Tuesday that subprime mortgage-related assets held by two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless.Bear’s stock fell 0.4 per cent to $139.34. The American stock exchange’s Broker-Dealer index closed 1.7 per cent lower.

The stock closed 2.4 per cent lower at $48.74.In prepared remarks before Congress, Mr Bernanke stressed concerns over inflation and the housing market and the Fed lowered its growth forecast for the US economy for 2007 and 2008.“There is no doubt that housing is a headwind for the economy,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment advisor at Deutsche Bank. “Bernanke’s testimony is fairly well balanced, but based on the June consumer price index [report] there are concerns that service sector inflation is not coming down.”The combination of a lower growth forecast and continued concern over inflation compounded the bearish open for stocks yesterday said traders.Higher oil prices were also on the radar screen of investors.“The market has broadly overlooked the recent rise in oil, but with sentiment turning negative, that has also become an issue,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The rise in oil prices during the past month does not bode well for future inflation numbers.”On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to close at 2,699.49 and led the major benchmarks lower. Sentiment for technology stocks was hit hard after Intel and Yahoo disappointed investors with their latest results.Intel posted better-than-forecast earnings, but its gross margin fell and the stock was 4.8 per cent lower at $25.06, after the chip maker had set a 52-week high of $26.52 on Tuesday.Yahoo’s quarterly results met estimates but guidance for the third quarter was lowered and the stock was off 4.8 per cent at $26.20.After the closing bell on Wednesday, IBM’s posted a rise of 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit and raised guidance for earnings in 2007. The stock set a 52-week high of $111.88 before the report and was trading higher in after-hours activity.Earnings after the bell from eBay also beat estimates and the stock rallied in after-hours trade, following a decline of 0.6 per cent to $34.05 in regular trade. Google reports on Thursday.Blue chips were hit by a number of earnings reports on Wednesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.4 per cent at 13,918.22.Mr Pado said: “The market had enjoyed a big run up ahead of earnings results and as a result we were bound to see some pullback once the numbers arrived.”An example of this was the performance of United Technologies which reported a second-quarter net income rise of 4 per cent from the same quarter last year, beating estimates. UTX fell 1.7 per cent to $75.56, after a rise of around 6 per cent in the past week.David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management said equities were suffering “bull market fatigue” after their recent record run. “Provided that earnings growth is sustained, valuation concerns can probably be put to one side for now.”A bright spot for earnings was Humana as the health insurer reported better than expected earnings and raised its 2007 earnings outlook. The stock rose 9.8 per cent to $68.31.In contrast, Altria said second-quarter income fell more than 18 per cent. The stock slid 1.4 per cent to $70.30 as full-year guidance was lowered.Pfizer’s quarterly profit fell 48 per cent, hurt by restructuring costs and weaker-than-expected drug sales. Pifzer did endorse its guidance for 2007 and 2008 and the stock fell 3.2 per cent to $25.13.Macy’s, the department store, surged 7.6 per cent to $43.09, amid talk that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, could make a $24bn buy-out.Earnings from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York and Bank of America are due on Thursday, while Dow stock, Honeywell also reports.In economic news on Wednesday, the consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in June. The core rate excluding food and energy rose 0.2 per cent, and was up from a 0.1 per cent rise in May. Economists had expected a 0.1 rise in headline CPI, with a 0.2 per cent core rate forecast.The overall CPI rose 2.7 per cent over the past year, while core CPI was up 2.2 per cent, steady with the annualised rate for May.Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: “Core inflation has behaved considerably better in the past few months and the near-term worries have receded, but the risks of too-high inflation remain and will keep the Fed uneasy.“In his prepared remarks before lawmakers, Mr Bernanke said the Fed expected core inflation to remain in a range of 2.00 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 2007, and then fall to a band of 1.75 per cent to 2.00 per cent in 2008.“Whether core inflation, at 2.2 per cent year-over-year, is contained or entrenched will remain a debate,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Mr Stanley said: “If the economy strengthens in the second half, as we expect, then core inflation will likely become a bigger concern, ultimately forcing the Fed to hike rates at some point, either late this year or in the first half of 2008.”Meanwhile, housing starts rose 2.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 1.467m annual rate in June, reversing some of the 3.4 per cent slide in May. However the May starts were revised lower from an original decline of 2.1 per cent.

Companies due to report their latest quarterly results on Tuesday include Johnson & Johnson, Yahoo, Intel, and Merrill Lynch.Among the groups reporting on Wednesday are Dow constituents United Technologies, which set an all-time high of $76.98 on Monday, JP Morgan and Pfizer, together with Wells Fargo and eBay.Google, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York, Bank of America are due to report on Thursday along with two Dow stocks, IBM – which reached a five year high of $109.88 on Monday – and Honeywell. Citigroup and Caterpillar, which set an all-time high of $86.49 on Monday, complete this week’s bluechip earnings line-up on Friday.With many banks reporting this week, investors are likely to focus on any evidence of problems in the mortgage market hurting their profits.”Continued weakness in mortgage banking, deteriorating credit quality, and a challenging yield curve for most of the quarter make negative earnings surprises more likely than results materially above expectations,” said strategists at Barclays Capital.The S&P financials sector has pared recent losses and on Monday the group entered positive territory for the year to date.As earnings beckon, technology stocks could extend their strong gains this year. Both Apple and Google set new record highs on Monday of $139.98 and $558.58 respectively. Analysts at Bespoke noted that technology leads other sectors in terms of international sales as a percentage of total sales.“It could be a good quarter for large cap tech, which explains the performance recently in stocks like Intel and Cisco,” said Bespoke.Citigroup said the 2008 consensus earnings estimates for Intel are low and that the chip maker “will accelerate its current low level of stock buyback activity.” The bank raised its price target for Intel to $31 from $27. The stock was a fraction higher at $25.98 on Monday, and is up more than 28 per cent so far this year.In deal news on Monday, IHOP, the restaurant chain operator, said it would buy Applebee’s for about $1.9bn or $25.50 a share. Applebee’s was up 1.9 per cent at $24.84, while IHOP surged 9 per cent to $61.29.Verizon was up 2.3 per cent at $42.70 at midday after the Financial Times’ Alphaville blog reported that Vodafone had considered a $160bn takeover of the US telecom group. Vodafone said it had no plans for such a deal.In earnings news, Mattel reported a 15 per cent rise in second-quarter profit.

Goldman Sachs fell 0.2 per cent to $216.72.Investors across a range of markets were watching equities for any sign that credit woes were spreading.“The lack of transparency in the credit market has left many emerging market participants focusing on equities as a better clue to risk aversion and risk liquidation,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich.Meanwhile, investors were also concerned that the US economy might face softer consumer spending if high petrol prices and the weak housing sector were to affect sentiment.“As US economic data show a moderation from the second-quarter rebound, that will add to fears that the economy is moving into a sustained downtrend,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Same store sales for June are due on Thursday and Thomson Financial estimates they will rise 1.8 per cent year-over-year, down from a 2.9 per cent rise in May. In June 2006, sales rose 3 per cent.American Eagle Outfitters said June same-store sales rose 8 per cent after the closing bell on Wednesday and its stock was up 6.5 per cent at $27.73 in after-hours trade.The prospect of weaker consumer growth has heightened the importance of the second-quarter earnings that are due over the next few weeks.The S&P’s decline of 1.4 per cent on Tuesday was the worst one-day slide in the index in more than a month and marked an inauspicious start to the second-quarter earnings season.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said it was the worst start to a quarterly reporting period “since the bull market began in October 2002”.They noted, however, that “a negative first day has had no bearing on the performance of the market for the rest of earnings season”.On Wednesday, tech stocks and blue chips rallied. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,651.79 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.6 per cent to close at 13,577.87.Alcoa was among the Dow leaders with a rise of 1.9 per cent to $42.43 while Intel, down 1.6 per cent at $24.57, was a laggard.Among other notable bluechip gainers, Honeywell rose 1.6 per cent to $58.74, and Caterpillar gained 1.2 per cent to $82.17.Among stocks in the news yesterday, NYSE Group rose 5.5 per cent to $82.11 after Lehman upgraded the exchange from “market weight” to “overweight”.Alcan rose 4 per cent to $89.60 The aluminium maker that is being stalked by Alcoa, said it had secured a ”white-knight” bidder to stall the hostile $28.7bn - around $76 a share bid - from its rival aluminium producer.Another stock in the news was Liz Claiborne. The clothing maker confirmed that it was seeking a buyer for 16 of its 36 apparel brands and its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $37.56.In deal news, Gerdau Ameristeel said it was buying Chaparral Steel for $4.22bn. Shares in Chaparral rose 10.6 per cent to $83.67.Genentech, the biotechnology company said its second quarter earnings rose 41 per cent versus the prior year, after the closing bell.Genentech raised its full year outlook and the stock initially rose in after-hours trade, after a rally of 1.4 per cent to $75.93 in regular trade.After the closing bell, Yum Brands, the operator of fast-food brands, said its second-quarter earnings rose 11.5 per cent. The stock was higher in after-hours trade. Yum rallied 4.9 per cent to $34.41 in regular trade after UBS upgraded it from “neutral” to “buy”Dendreon fell 2.6 per cent to $7.94 after the biotechnology company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal inquiry into its prostate cancer drug.
276;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-06-29T22:44:41Z;Factory raided in music probe;;Investigators from the British Phonographic Industry have for the first time raided a business in pursuit of illegal music file-sharing.The probe centres on a factory owned by US conglomerate Honeywell, in Motherwell, Scotland.Strathclyde police officers and investigators raided the plant on Thursday morning and made copies of the contents of computers for forensic analysis.Honeywell said it was co-operating fully with both the police and the BPI.The BPI, which represents the music industry, said the raid followed a two-month investigation prompted by a tip-off. A Honeywell employee had provided evidence that suggested thousands of music files were being shared illegally.Previous raids have concentrated on domestic file-sharing, which remains the music industry’s main concern.It is illegal to copy and distribute songs on an internal computer network but no company has been prosecuted. The Honeywell plant manufactures electronic building control systems.Strathclyde police said a number of employees were assisting with inquiries and a report would be submitted to the local procurator-fiscal, who decides whether cases should be pursued.Ann Van Hooydonck, of Honeywell in Europe, said the company considered copyright infringement “a very serious matter” and had policies aimed at preventing piracy on its premises.Businesses that do not put in place strict policies to prevent the copying and distributing of music on company equipment are liable under the law.“File-sharing music in the workplace is illegal, misuses company resources, wastes employees’ time and introduces network security risks,” said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI.“Uploading music files to a company computer network for other employees to download is a serious offence.”Not having an anti-piracy policy could expose a company and its employees to the risk of civil proceedings or a criminal investigation, Mr Taylor said.Company directors face unlimited fines and up to 10 years in prison if convicted on indictment for piracy offences in the UK.On summary conviction, they face up to six months in prison and fines of up to £5,000.The BPI said its key area of concern regarding digital music piracy was still people who file-shared music illegally using home computers with peer-to-peer software.It cited research that estimates the cost of piracy to the UK recording industry at more than £400m annually.
277;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-05-09T21:38:13Z;Wall St rises as no change in Fed policy;;Wall Street rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signalled no change in its policy stance and outlook.The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave interest rates steady yet still flag up concerns over inflation, sparked a brief bout of selling in stocks. But the market quickly recovered and closed significantly stronger than where they had been before the Fed’s announcement.“The Fed did not scare the market by sounding hawkish on inflation,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “Based on current expectations, a rate cut is still likely by the end of the year, and that’s positive for stocks.”Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, said: “A rate cut is coming, but the Fed is biding its time and waiting for a clear peak in inflation.”At late afternoon, the S&P 500 index had closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,5012.58, led by gains in telecom, industrial and financial stocks. The index is nearing its March 2000 record close of 1,527.46.A big talking point among investors on Wednesday was Cisco as it shares slid 6.5 per cent to $26.51. The computer network operator’s fiscal third-quarter profits rose 34 per cent from the same period last year, but investors were hoping for more robust revenue guidance.“Of the 12 times the stock has opened lower on earnings since 2002, it has gone up from the open just once,” according to the Bespoke Investment Group.Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq Composite for much of on Wednesday, but the tech heavy benchmark pared losses after the FOMC meeting and closed up 0.2 per cent at at 2,576.34.Texas Instruments rose 4.7 per cent to $36.83, after the maker of phone chips raised its profit margin targets on expectations for strong revenue growth.Blue-chips benefited from the FOMC outcome and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to a new record close of 13,362.87. Honeywell, up 1.8 per cent at $56.81, and Caterpillar, up 1.8 per cent at $74.75, boosted the Dow.IBM also boosted blue chips after Goldman Sachs upgraded “Big Blue” to a “buy” from “neutral” amid the company’s plans to repurchase stock and cut costs.That reversed Goldmans’ downgrade made last week. IBM shares closed up 1.1 per cent at $104.38, after setting a 52-week high of $104.75 earlier in the morning.A drag on the Dow was Walt Disney after it reported second quarter profit rose 27 per cent, but quarterly revenue was less than expected. Shares fell 1.2 per cent to $36.12, after the stock set a six-year high of $36.57 on Tuesday.Beyond the FOMC meeting, analysts said the outlook for stocks remained positive.Mr Skrainka said “the market is still at a fair level relative to earnings,” and investors were encouraged that corporate earnings had advanced near a double-digit pace in spite of a much slower economy during the first quarter.Mr Ablin said other factors continued to support stock prices. “More than 200 companies in the S&P 500 sport a free cash flow yield in excess of the 10-year Treasury note, suggesting that the environment remains ripe for more buyouts and buybacks.”The housing market remains one of the economy’s weak spots, highlighted on Wednesday when Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes, warned that it would not meet recent quarterly and annual guidance. Its shares fell 0.55 per cent to $29.05.In other earnings news, News Corp reported a 6.2 per cent rise in profits for its fiscal third quarter, meeting analysts’ estimates. The media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch launched a $5bn bid for Dow Jones last week, but has been rebuffed by the Bancroft family which controls the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. News Corp was 1.65 per cent lower at $23.26 at mid-afternoon.One of the biggest movers on Wednesday was drugmaker Dendreon. The stock plunged 64.3 per cent to $6.33 after the Food and Drug Administration sought more information about its prostate cancer vaccine.Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, a speciality drugmaker, slid 11.3 per cent to $15.97, after the FDA sought details about its experimental drug to treat smoking and gambling addiction.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 3.3 per cent to $10.24 after the drugmaker agreed to develop and market a cholesterol drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb.Shares in Electronic Arts fell 4.3 per cent to $50.65 after the video game maker reported a larger-than-forecast fiscal fourth-quarter loss.
278;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-04-25T22:00:02Z;EU watchdog faces €1.6bn damages claim;;The European Union’s top antitrust regulator was on Wednesday forced to defend itself against a €1.6bn ($2.2bn, £799m) damages claim, in a ground-breaking legal case over the watchdog’s decision to block a merger of two French groups almost six years ago.Schneider Electric, the electrical equipment maker, filed a damages suit against the European Commission to recoup the losses it suffered as a result of a failed attempt to take over rival Legrand. The €5.4bn deal was blocked by the Brussels regulator in October 2001, but the following year a court found that the Commission’s economic reasoning was flawed – and annulled the ruling.If successful, Schneider’s damages claim – which was on Wednesday heard by the European Court of First Instance, the EU’s second-highest court – could encourage other companies that have suffered from wrong Commission antitrust rulings to take similar action.For the regulator itself, the outcome matters not only because of the potentially serious financial loss but also because it may act as a further deterrent against blocking big mergers and takeovers.Schneider argues that the Commission’s handling of the merger review was so riddled with errors that the eventual ruling “manifestly and seriously” exceeded the limits of the regulator’s discretion. The bulk of the damages claimed by the French group is linked to the fact that it was forced to unwind the already completed take­over of Legrand, and sell the shares at a loss.A judgment is expected in the coming months.The Schneider decision was taken by Mario Monti, the previous EU competition commissioner who also presided over other high-profile merger prohibitions, including one that killed the proposed tie-up between General Electric and Honeywell.Mr Monti then had to endure the embarrassment of seeing three of his merger prohibitions overturned in court – a run of defeats that led to wholesale changes in the Commission’s merger review process and a more cautious approach towards blocking deals.No company has ever been awarded damages as a result of an annulled Commission merger ruling and the Schneider case is being followed closely by competition lawyers around Europe. It is also of interest to MyTravel, the UK group whose proposed merger with First Choice was also blocked by the Commission and later overturned. MyTravel has filed a similar damages claim that has yet to be heard by the Luxembourg-based court.“It will be very big news if this case goes in Schneider’s favour. Nothing like this has been done before successfully,” said Alec Burnside, a competition lawyer and Brussels-based partner at Linklaters. However, Mr Burnside cautioned that the Commission had already become much more diligent and cautious about blocking deals, limiting the case’s impact on future rulings.The spokesman for Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner and Mr Monti’s successor, said: “We do not consider the claims to be well founded.”
279;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-04-25T18:29:07Z;The Short View: Insignificant landmark;;Needed: one bucket of cold water. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the world’s best-known stock market benchmark, passed 13,000 for the first time early yesterday. It was a symptom of the air of optimism in Wall Street. But ultimately a landmark for the Dow signifies little or nothing.This column has addressed the Dow’s technical limitations before. It is weighted by share price, not market value, so the biggest companies do not have the biggest impact. A third of the 1,000 index points by which the Dow has increased since it passed 12,000 last October came from just four companies – Altria, Boeing, Honeywell and ExxonMobil.It is too heavily weighted towards industrials to be a barometer of corporate America. But with constituents such as Citigroup, Wal-Mart, Microsoft and McDonald’s, it is not a true industrial index either.It is not even a true benchmark for “mega-cap” large companies. These are under-performing but you need the Russell Top 50 index, up only 1.6 per cent this year, compared with a 4.2 per cent rise in the Dow, to tell you this.Its defenders point out that the Dow continues to be correlated closely with the S&P 500, by far the most important index in terms of the money linked to it. But that acknowledges the importance of the S&P, which needs to grow only 2.7 per cent to set its first record high since 2000 – a much more important event.Ironically, another Dow Jones benchmark set up at the same time as the Industrials may be more interesting. The 20-stock Transportation Average is also at a record high. It is up 14 per cent for the year – 10 percentage points better than the Industrials.Transport stocks are highly exposed to the global economy, and a joint high for Industrials and Transportation is traditionally viewed as a very bullish indicator. It at least suggests that if there is a risk at present, it is of overheating, not a slowdown. That, maybe, is of some interest.Video: John Authers on Dow’s new milestone
280;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-04-20T22:19:51Z;Dollar comes to rescue of Corporate America;;The weak dollar and strong overseas markets came to corporate America’s rescue on Friday with blue-chip companies such as industrial giants Honeywell and Caterpillar and the drugmaker Pfizer reaping the benefits of international exposure.Several companies, including the fast food chain McDonald’s and the recruitment agency Manpower, beat Wall Street analysts expectations as the strength of foreign markets more than offset the weakness of the US economy.Jim Owens, chief executive of the heavy construction equipment maker Caterpillar, summed up the past few months for many US companies when he said: “Exceptional growth outside North America helped us deliver good results in a tough quarter.”The string of strong earnings and positive predictions helped the stock market to move higher. The Dow Jones Industrial index, which hit a record high twice already this week, closed in on the landmark 13,000 level, ending the day at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The first quarter results highlighted US companies’ need to drive growth to counter the slowdown in the domestic economy.That task has been made easier by a sharp slide in the dollar over the past few months, which benefits US groups with earnings in foreign currencies but penalises companies, especially smaller ones, that rely on imports.The threat posed by a weak dollar, which this week briefly touched a 26-year low against the British pound, to America’s small- and medium-sized companies could fuel calls from protectionist measures by some of the 2008 presidential hopefuls.By contrast, Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, said it expected international sales to come in higher by nearly $1bn over the next two years due to ”primarily a strengthening of the euro relative to the dollar since our previous forecast in January.”The company predicted that the stronger euro would boost this year’s sales by $450m more than expected.Although the increase is small compared with Pfizer’s $47bn-$48bn forecast annual revenues, it will help offset the sudden loss of $1.2bn due to generic competition after a key patent expiry on a blockbuster hypertension drug.Meanwhile, Honeywell raised its sales forecast for the year by $700m to $33.5bn. David Anderson, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times some $300m of the improved sales would come from favourable currency movements. He said $150m of that had already been achieved in the first quarter of the year, helping Honeywell to beat analysts’ expectations. The company reported a 21 per cent rise in net income to $526m in the three months to March.At Caterpillar, a downturn in North America was partly countered by strong sales in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Overall, first quarter profits quarter fell $24m to $816m.
281;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-04-20T13:02:38Z;Wall St advances to new highs;;Solid earnings and speculation about buy-outs of financial groups pushed US stocks into record territory this week as the leading indices recouped all the losses from the slump that began in late February.Boosted by bullish earnings updates from Caterpillar and Honeywell on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The S&P 500 index broke through its high for the year reached before the plunge in equities two months ago, rising 0.9 per cent to 1,484.35 on Friday to stand 2.2 per cent up this week.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent this week to 2,526.39.While the advance gathered pace on Friday, the rally earlier in the week was driven by a relatively narrow base of stocks. Blue chips had the best of the gains: the Dow Jones advanced 2.8 per cent this week while the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose just 1.2 per cent.“The big driver has been earnings, which have been much better than anticipated – we set the bar so low,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.“It is a ‘Chicken Little’ recovery – the market rises yet never seems able to generate confidence.”Google led the way up after beating analysts’ expectations with a sharp rise in profits on the back of strong search engine revenues. Its shares rose 2.3 per cent to $482.48.This rise was in stark contrast to Yahoo, which slid 12.6 per cent to $27.46 this week after the introduction of Panama, its new online advertising system, failed to stem the deterioration in profits and sales. Caterpillar, a Dow component, surged 4.7 per cent to $71.82 on Friday after the heavy machinery maker reported profits in excess of analysts’ estimates and raised its earnings forecasts.Shares in Honeywell International rose 4.8 per cent to $51.40 on Friday after the industrial conglomerate raised its earnings forecasts for the year and beat Wall Street profit estimates.The financial sector came in from the cold this week, with the S&P Financial index up 3.9 per cent to break past its 50-day moving average and stand in positive territory for the year.The rise came amid a burst of takeover speculation after a $25bn agreed buy-out of Sallie Mae, the student loan group, by a JC Flowers-led consortium that sent shares in Sallie Mae up 15.5 per cent to $54 this week.The groundbreaking deal, which is structured to make it unnecessary for Sallie Mae to hold its own capital, turned attention to financial groups that were previously considered improbable buy-out targets. Foremost among those was Countrywide Financial, the biggest home lender, which jumped 11.1 per cent to $37.36.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Merrill Lynch, which has made bullish comments about the subprime mortgage market.Merrill rose 6.7 per cent to $92.02 this week after reporting a four-fold rise in profits.In the latest example of the growing appetite for financial deals, H&R Block agreed to sell Option One Mortgage, its subprime mortgage unit, to a company affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity group. Shares in H&R Block rose 3.3 per cent to $22.56 on Friday.Intel made big gains this week, rising 8.3 per cent to $21.16, as the chipmaker raised its revenue forecasts after a successful overhaul of its product line.Rival AMD fared less well, easing 0.8 per cent to $14.16 on Friday after what Robert Rivet, chief executive, described as a “disappointing and unacceptable” first quarter, with lower sales and deteriorating margins.The rally in railway stocks gathered steam as TCI, the activist hedge fund, built a stake in CSX, highlighting the potential for takeovers and asset sales in this cash-generative sector.Shares in CSX jumped 6.1 per cent to $4504.Atticus, a hedge fund that has worked with TCI in the past, already holds big stakes in railway groups, including Union Pacific, which rose 6.8 per cent this week to $117.21.Homebuilders bounced off their lows for the year as fears eased about the severity of the housing market downturn. The S&P Homebuilders index jumped 8.6 per cent while DR Horton rose 8.9 per cent to $23.39.
282;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-04-11T20:35:41Z;Wall St slumps on inflation worries;;Wall Street slumped on Wednesday, as a major cost-cutting plan from Citigroup and the Federal Reserve’s focus on inflation left investors cold and terminated a recent winning streak for stocks.The minutes from last month’s Federal Reserve meeting sparked renewed selling on Wednesday afternoon as officials said more rate hikes “might prove necessary,” as inflation risks have grown.The S&P 500 index fell 0.65 per cent to close at 1,438.86, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.75 per cent to finish at 2,459.31.“Until uncertainty over the economy clears, stocks are not going anywhere in the next couple of months,” said Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman.Worries about the economy mainly centre upon housing and stocks were also shaken when the National Association of Realtors forecast existing home sales would fall 2.2 per cent in 2007, down from a previous estimate of a 0.9 per cent slide.Homebuilder stocks slumped, led by Lennar, down 3.1 per cent at $40.98, while financial stocks also came under pressure.The bearish mood snapped an eight day winning streak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow fell 0.7 per cent to 12,484.29, and broke its best run since March 2003, weighed down in part by selling in Citigroup.The bank announced plans to cut 17,000 jobs, but investors were unimpressed and the stock fell 1.15 per cent to $51.80.For the year, Citigroup is down 7 per cent and is one of the worst performing stocks in the Dow. Other Dow laggards were General Motors, down 1.9 per cent at $31.46, and Honeywell, off 1.25 per cent at $46.39.By contrast, Alcoa continued to rise after its net profit rose 9 per cent during the first quarter and beat estimates.Alcoa gained 0.5 per cent to $35.08, and the stock leads the Dow this year with a gain of 16.9 per cent.Among stocks in the news on Wednesday was the Nasdaq Stock Market itself, after it revealed it was holding talks with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange about purchasing the regional exchange that specialises in options trading. Nasdaq stock fell 0.8 per cent to $29.40.Manor Care said it had retained JPMorgan to advise the manager of nursing homes and its shares jumped 10.5 per cent to $61.58.Earnings season picked up speed after the closing bell on Wednesday.Genentech rose 0.5 per cent to $83 in after-hours trade when its first quarter profit beat estimates. The biotech group had closed up 0.15 per cent at $82.69 in regular trade.Research in Motion missed fourth-quarter estimates and in after-hours trade its stock slid 6.4 per cent to $138.81.The stock closed 1.5 per cent lower at $146.02, after it had set a 52-week at $148.95 high earlier in the day.
283;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-03-23T20:30:42Z;Friar Fred maintains his vow of abstinence – just;;But it must not bar RBS from eyeing ABNTaking a vow of silence is a strange way to break a vow of abstinence. But by refusing to comment on the possibility that Royal Bank of Scotland would enter the battle for ABN Amro, Sir Fred Goodwin, the bank’s chief executive, may have signalled the end of his commitment to keep his wallet shut on big transforming deals.Like all such vows, this was an artificial constraint, imposed more than 18 months ago by unreasonably twitchy RBS investors, worried Sir Fred would recklessly blow their money and his credibility on more large acquisitions. Like some frustrated Scottish monk, the chief executive has had to intone ritually at every analysts’ meeting that he has no such plans.But it would be mad – or at least a breach of his fiduciary duty to investors – for Sir Fred to rule out an interest in ABN Amro at this stage. The savings from a merger with RBS, according to recent much-touted research by Keefe Bruyette & Woods, would be more substantial than from a Barclays deal. Like ABN, RBS has a strong retail banking presence in the US. As underlined by Friday’s reinforcement of the American management team (the real reason the RBS chief submitted himself to ordeal by press conference), RBS is readying itself for a new phase of growth there.The chances are nil that Friar Fred might follow Barclays’ lead and offer to trade his Edinburgh cell for a salon in suburban Amsterdam to clinch a deal. But otherwise, until Barclays reveals its hand, he is perfectly right to keep all his options chastely open.How Melrose bloomedMelrose could hardly have asked for a better advertisement of its business model – a rare form of intense private-equity-style management on the public markets – than Friday’s sale of its aerospace businesses, once part of McKechnie. The enterprise value of $855.6m (£434.9m) will be two-and-a-half times what the industrial investment company paid Cinven, another buy-out firm, less than two years ago. Given that sceptics wondered at the time whether there was much more to squeeze from McKechnie, that is a fine result, the only blemish being that Melrose has to hold on to its UK subsidiary’s pension fund deficit.Once Melrose has given an estimated £200m back to its own shareholders, expect the company to go hunting for private equity-owned industrial groups that have not responded to the buy-out artists’ magic touch, and listed companies with under-exploited potential.The company got full marks for strategic effort, but zero for tactical nous, when it launched a hostile bid for the much larger Novar in 2004. Honeywell, the US conglomerate, stepped in and trumped the UK group’s cash-and-share offer with loose change, leaving Melrose looking like its unpaid talent scout. Next time, Melrose is likely to ensure it has a stake before bidding starts. It could either find a large shareholder in the target prepared to back a deal or team up with an activist fund, such as Polygon (which Melrose consulted at the time of the Novar approach).Melrose paper looks more attractive now than it did in 2004. The top managers could start claiming big incentive share payments this year, but they seem prepared instead to roll over the bonus scheme when it falls due in 2009. The stock has been trading on a forward p/e ratio of 12 or 13, a discount to mid-cap industrials. Uncertainty is built in – who knows precisely what Melrose will own a year or two from now? – but that rating still looks ungenerous.Jupiter runs ringsThey say good things come to those who wait. So they have for Edward Bonham Carter, who stayed on as chief executive of Jupiter Asset Management when founder John Duffield left in 2000 after a row with Commerzbank, its parent. This week, Mr Bonham Carter and his team vetoed a flotation and agreed to buy Jupiter for just €1bn, or about £700m.Commerzbank claimed it gained €300m from the sale – enough to satisfy honour after an uncomfortable 12 years as Jupiter’s owner. But it might have doubled its money if Jupiter had been floated. The problem was convincing Mr Bonham Carter and his team they should run the company in the glare of the volatile public markets. Without the consent of the managers whose names are inextricably linked with the funds they run, Jupiter is worth very little. So when Mr Bonham Carter and his cohorts chose to buy the group themselves rather than float it, Commerzbank had little choice. And when he decided Jupiter staff should have a majority stake in the new company, again, Commerzbank and the private equity firms vying for Jupiter’s favour could only agree or back away. Even when the team put a £700m price tag on Jupiter, knowing direct rivals managing similar amounts of assets were valued at twice that, Commerzbank could only nod. Hard-ball negotiating tactics of which Mr Duffield would have been proud.
284;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-03-22T17:58:07Z;Will the Commission go back to blocking mergers?;;The European Commission enjoys many powers, though none is quite as jaw-droppingly awesome and downright glamorous as its ability to block big, international mergers and takeovers.Indeed, the first (and perhaps only) time that mainstream America became aware of the Commission’s existence was when the Brussels body blocked the tie-up of General Electric and Honeywell in 2001. The ruling sparked outrage on the other side of the Atlantic, and left many commentators spluttering how a little-known institution an ocean away was in a position to thwart the marriage of two US corporate icons.Much has changed since then. There have been fewer deals, and certainly fewer deals that were driven by corporate egos and a mindless pursuit of size (which tend to create greater competition worries than smaller acquisitions). Scarred by a string of court rulings that overturned three merger prohibitions in 2002, the Commission also became much more careful about blocking deals. Both sides, in any case, became better at putting together remedies that allowed even problematic deals to go through in exchange for asset disposals or other concessions.In fact, since the GE/Honeywell ruling the Commission has prohibited only one merger – and things were starting to look rather boring. The days of big merger dramas seemed to be over for good.More recently, however, there have been signs that the pendulum may be swinging back again. Most importantly, we have seen a rash of recent merger announcements that look like they could create a real headache for the Brussels antitrust officials.In the travel sector, the big four groups -Tui, Thomas Cook, First Choice and MyTravel – seem committed to merging themselves into two mega-groups. As several antitrust specialist already pointed out, a market that shrinks from four to three big companies is already seen as problematic by the Commission. Going from four to two invites serious trouble.A similar picture can be found in the music industry. Here, too, there is the distinct prospect of only three large groups remaining, namely Universal, Sony BMG and – if they finally get their act together – Warner EMI (or EMI Warner?).In addition, the Commission last July saw its 2004 decision to clear the merger of Sony and BMG overturned in Court. It must therefore be aware that waving through difficult deals is by no means a safe option.Of course, I would never at this stage want to make a prediction about Commission merger decisions. In both the travel and the music deals, the traditional operators are coming under huge pressure from online providers – which means that competition could stay vibrant even with fewer players.But I would not be altogether surprised if 2007 became the year in which the Commission finally moved to block another big cross-border deal.
285;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2007-01-15T21:21:14Z;Smiths chief can breathe easily;;Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, chief executive of Smiths Group, breathed a sigh of relief on Monday as investors reacted warmly to GE’s $4.8bn offer for his company’s aerospace business.For the past year, shareholders and analysts have taken the chief executive to task because of the disappointing performance of the unit when other aerospace companies have been making huge profits.Mr Butler-Wheelhouse is associated closely with the business after his £1.8bn ($3.5bn) acquisition of TI Group in 2000, which included Dowty, the aircraft parts maker.“We disproportionately invested in the business and that was not recognised by our followers,” he said yesterday. The total valuation on different parts of Smiths’ aerospace business – about £1.7bn to £1.8bn – was well below what the company had just realised for the unit, he added.“We were not producing the short-term income so people were taking a short-term view.”Analysts welcomed the deal, worth about twice the unit’s sales and about 10 times earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. “It is a good exit multiple,” said Ben Fidler, aerospace analyst at Deutsche Bank. “It gets them out of what had been a problematic business recently.”Others are still not convinced that Smiths made as much of the electronics systems businesses as it should have, though they conceded that it had achieved a good sale price to GE.“A couple of the large shareholders had grumbled that Smiths had not really done anything with it,” one senior industry adviser said. “The business had not really transformed itself.”GE clearly believes it has the capital and the scale to exploit the business, which has won positions on big new military and civil aircraft such as the Airbus A380, Boeing 787 and Lockheed Martin’s joint strike fighter.“They have done a great job of getting on new platforms and we like businesses that require scale,” said Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s chairman and chief executive. “This is a set of platforms that we can grow organically over a long period of time…We are going to be in this business for ever.”The purchase of Smiths Aerospace is part of GE’s strategy to invest in higher margin, technology-driven businesses to offset slower growth in the industrial and entertainment units of its sprawling portfolio.GE’s share price has underperformed the market since Mr Immelt replaced Jack Welch in 2001.Mr Immelt has been under pressure to boost growth in profits and revenues through acquisitions and to fix or sell struggling units such as NBC Universal, the television and film subsidiary. He has also sold its reinsurance business and put its long-suffering plastics division up for sale.A deal with Smiths will enable the US conglomerate to harness its commanding position in the market for jet engines by adding electronic and cockpit systems.GE faced competition in the bidding process from other US industrial groups, such as Honeywell, and European defence and aerospace groups, including Thales of France.The deal with GE, however, was sweetened by a separate agreement for the two companies to form a joint venture of their fast-growing detection businesses, which build scanning systems for airports, the military and transport and cargo hubs.Smiths wanted to buy GE’s detection business outright but was turned down flat by Mr Immelt. “The truth is both sides would have loved to have bought the other guy’s detection business,” said an adviser on the deal. “Neither wanted to sell to the other guy.”The fact that Smiths is selling out of aerospace should clear the path for the company to concentrate on the promising detection unit, according to Mr Immelt.“This is now a pre-eminent business for Smiths” he said. “Keith has every incentive to make this business financially and strategically successful. Our interests are completely aligned so I don’t have to sit there saying, ‘Oh my god, I’m worried sick.’ ”Additional reporting by Doug Cameron in Chicago
286;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Move highlights Immelt’s style;;Since the day he took charge of General Electric more than five years ago, Jeffrey Immelt has faced comparisons with the 20-year reign of Jack Welch at the US conglomerate.But Monday’s $4.8bn deal to buy the aerospace division of Smiths Industries of the UK is a telling example of the differences in style and substance between Mr Immelt and his larger-than-life predecessor.Mr Immelt’s stated desire of increasing GE’s focus on high-margin businesses and improving its customer service – a departure from the Welch days of stringent cost cutting and manufacturing prowess – are behind the Smiths acquisition.By adding Smiths’ cockpit electronics to its larger aero-engine business GE will be able to offer customers such as Boeing and the US military a one-stop solution, which in turn should give GE the leverage to raise prices and increase margins.Ironically, that was also one of the aims of Mr Welch’s final chapter at the helm of GE six years ago – the attempted $42bn takeover of its US rival Honeywell. Instead of going for the purchase of a large rival and risk being blocked by anti-trust regulators, Mr Immelt opted for a smaller acquisition of a business that complements GE’s existing strengths in jet engines.In Mr Immelt’s view, during a period of increasingly global markets and rising competition from low-cost countries, a group as diverse and sprawling as GE can only grow if it can convince customers that its products and services deserve a premium price.That is why he ordered all the businesses in GE’s locomotive-to-movies portfolio to submit themselves to the rigorous and unflattering process of asking customers to rate their services. The internal revolution has been accompanied by a cautious approach to mergers and acquisitions. Although Mr Immelt has presided over some $70bn of deals during his period at the head of GE, he has repeatedly stated that its focus is to drive organic growth.However, perhaps spurred by a share price that has underperformed the market since his arrival, Mr Immelt has recently begun to put more emphasis on deal-making.Similarly, a number of underperforming subsidiaries have either been sold or slated for a divestment.These moves have helped the chief executive to move out of the imposing shadow of his predecessor but the final test of whether the Immelt era is capable of outshining the Welch one will be whether the share price begins marching upwards.
287;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
288;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-12-29T20:03:59Z;Picking next year’s runners and riders in M&A;;Even after one of the busiest years for mergers and acquisitions ever, many bankers insist that 2007 will produce at least as many deals. Below are some of areas where bankers, investors and analysts expect to see action.Aerospace, DefenceThe threat of terrorism and conflict has driven governments and individuals to spend more on bolstering their security, fuelling speculation of deals in the sector. Analysts believe Smiths Group, Meggitt, Cobham and Ultra Electronicscould all become subject to bid approaches over the next few months. United Technologies or Honeywell of the US and Italy’s Finmeccanica could all be interested in buying UK assets. Old rumours persist that Invensys is being eyed by private equity and trade buyers.ChemicalsPwC recently said consolidation in the chemicals sector would continue as companies seek greater strength to combat rising oil prices, competition from developing economies and increased regulation. Top of the list of targets is ICI, which came into the spotlight in November when it sold its Quest fragrances and flavours business to Givaudan of Switzerland for £1.2bn. Some dealers now believe ICI’s coatings division would be a good fit with Akzo Nobel’s. Johnson Matthey, the catalysts and precious metals group, could also attract a predator, some bankers believe. Elementis is also a potential target.Oil, gas and miningAlthough the high oil price has prevented consolidation among the big players, investor focus has stayed on Abbot Group, which is being touted as a potential bid target for Wood Group, and Premier Oil, which may become the latest UK company to be acquired by a Middle East buyer, Dubai Energy. Among the miners, many hope that talks between Lonmin and Gold Fields, the world’s fourth largest gold miner, will be revived.RetailJ Sainsbury has been the focus of takeover talk for more than a year with private equity thought to be attracted to the group’s property portfolio. Woolworths is regarded by many as one of the most likely targets as it continues to struggle: it issued a profit warning shortly before Christmas. Its shares surged this week on rumours of a bid from Baugur – the Icelanders already own 10 per cent. Analysts have also singled out Galiform, the former MFI Furniture Group, as a target for private equity, although its pension fund deficit may prove an obstacle. Baugur has also been suggested as a bidder for JJB Sports or Moss Bros.Leisure & consumerCadbury Schweppes has been subject to rumours of predatory interest from Kraft Foods and Hershey. Gallaher, the cigarette manufacturer, may have agreed to be bought by Japan Tobacco, but some investors continue to hope for a counterbid: the stock trades at £11.46½, just above Japan Tobacco’s offer of £11.40. Names in the frame include Altria, owner of Philip Morris of the US, Spain’s Altadis or BAT of the UK, although all would have to overcome plenty of regulatory or financial hurdles. Whitbread, the leisure group has also been the subject of intense take-over rumours. Barry Sternlicht, the US founder of Starwood Capital, recently increased his holding to almost 3 per cent. A number of private equity firms are also thought to have taken a look at it.PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceuticals sector has come under increasing pricing pressure and large companies have been anxious to fill their pipelines by buying smaller biotech companies. The past few weeks have seen rumours that GlaxoSmithKline may sell its £12bn home-products business. The group has been mentioned in the same breath as Novartis, its Swiss-based rival. AstraZeneca, itself long regarded as a target, has been linked with Shire Pharmaceuticals, which bankers suggest might solve Astra’s pipeline problems. Analysts also predict a trade bidder or one of the new private equity owners of Biomet, the US medical devices group, will bid for Smith & Nephew, which looks vulnerable after losing its own bid for Biomet.UtilitiesAlthough the utilities sector has been the focus of much M&A activity this year, bankers still believe more is to come. Hopes rest on Northumbrian Water, Kelda and Pennon, owner of South West Water. Of the three, Kelda, which owns Yorkshire Water, is pegged as the most likely because of its relatively ungeared balance sheet. Rumours that Centrica, frequently seen as a target for Gazprom of Russia, will finally receive a bid, have also refused to die down. But perhaps the most imminent deal could be a counterbid for Scottish Power. The UK utility has agreed to be bought by Spain’s Iberdrola, but some analysts believe a counterbid from Electricité de France could still come. EDF has been ambiguous about its intentions.FinancialsMan Group, the world’s largest listed hedge fund manager, has been in the takeover frame for several weeks, with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch suggested as acquirers. The company may demerge its brokerage business. Scottish Widows, the life assurance business of Lloyds TSB, could also be acquired. The bank received several expressions of interest in its closed-life books this year, and it is thought Axa and Swiss Re have expressed interest in buying the whole of Scottish Widows. Some bankers and analysts predict Aviva will return with a higher offer for Prudential after the UK insurer rejected a £17bn takeover approach this year, or be a target itself. Some investors and analysts believe the Pru may sell its UK life business,or Egg, the internet bank in which Citigroup has expressed an interest. They will also be keeping an eye on Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley, which may attract interest from European banks looking to expand in the UK. One broker has suggested a merger between the two would have compelling industrial logic. Barclayswas the subject of takeover speculation for much of this year, but Bank of America recently played down talk it was planning a move.MediaWhen Trinity Mirror announced plans to sell the Racing Post and some of its regional newspapers this month, private equity and trade rivals immediately began considering bids for the titles being sold, for what would be left or even for the whole lot. Montagu, which owns French racing titles Paris Turf and Week End, has been cited as a potential bidder, as have sports publishing groups, such as RCS, which owns Italian daily Gazzetta dello Sport. Gaming and betting companies such as Ladbrokes, Gala and Arena Leisure could also be interested acquirers. Speculation round EMI has been rife for months and, after a £2.5bn sale of the music group to Permira collapsed this month, hopes rest on other buy-out groups coming forward. Informa, the publisher of Lloyd’s List, which rejected a joint bid from Cinven and Candover this year, may also be up for grabs.
289;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Creditors seek adviser on Delta takeover moves;;Delta Air Lines’ unsecured creditors plan to hire former Continental chairman Gordon Bethune as an adviser to evaluate the competing claims for control of the third-largest US airline.The official committee and an ad hoc group of bondholders are examining Delta’s plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection in the second quarter of next year and the hostile $8.3bn merger plan from US Airways, its smaller rival.The two sides have traded gigabytes of competing Powerpoint presentations this week, and Mr Bethune is expected to assist an assessment which sources close to the committee do not expect to be concluded until mid-January.Mr Bethune was chairman and chief executive of Continental from 1994 until the end of 2004, and is credited with leading the revival of the company after two spells in bankruptcy protection.The Houston-based carrier is also evaluating the potential merger combinations triggered by US Airways’ offer, and has held exploratory talks with United, which is in turn also eyeing Delta.Mr Bethune, a former Boeing executive, currently chairs the parent of Aloha Airlines and is also on the board of Honeywell. Delta and US Airways are vying for the support of two-thirds of the nine-member official committee - and 50 per cent of the estimated $15bn in claims – needed to secure approval for their competing plans, which must also be cleared by the court.US Airways on Thursday launched a detailed rebuttal of Delta’s stand-alone plan, and dismissed its estimates for valuation and financial performance as “unrealistic”.The carrier also sought to defuse concern that regulators would block or delay a combination of the third and fifth-largest US carriers. Delta rejected the US Airways bid this week, citing the likelihood of a lengthy regulatory review and citing a range of “flaws” with the cash and stock proposal.US Airways on Thursday said that antitrust regulators could provide “substantive feedback in a matter of weeks” on its offer if Delta agreed to due diligence and allowed a formal review to begin.Jerry Grinstein, Delta’s chairman and chief executive, told the FT this week that his board would not agree to US Airways’ request to conduct due diligence even if, as many analysts expect, its smaller rival returns with a revised offer. ends
290;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-11-06T15:26:48Z;FTSE 100 closes at five year high;;Galiform, the former MFI Furniture Group, registered its best finish since the sale of its retail operations in September yesterday as takeover rumours swirled.Its shares gained 3.9 per cent to 106p amid talk that private equity and industry buyers are circling the group.Galiform’s main operation is Howden, a highly profitable joinery business that could be attractive to Travis Perkins, 0.7 per cent higher at £17.99, Kingfisher, 1.4 per cent better at 267½p, or a venture capital house.However, analysts were sceptical of the rumours. They reckoned a private equity bid was unlikely given Galiform’s pension fund deficit. Moreover, they cautioned that a trade buyer was likely to wait until Galiform has completely severed its trading links with MFI before making a move.Galiform was by no means the only bid story doing the rounds in a strong London market.EMI gained 4.2 per cent to 281¾p on talk that it is the Western European media company that Istithmar, an investment agency of the Dubai government, is looking to buy a controlling stake in.Last month, David Jackson, the chief executive of Istithmar, revealed he was looking to buy a controlling stake in a European media company in a deal worth around $4bn. The market capitalisation of EMI last night was just over $4bn.Smiths Group, the aerospace and defence conglomerate, rose 1.8 per cent to 950p on rumours of predatory interest from Honeywell of the US.Elsewhere, rumours of a £14.50-a-share bid from Dubai Energy helped Premier Oil improve 0.5 per cent to £13.33, while further talk of bid from a European rival helped Scottish Power finish 2 per cent higher at 667½.Wolverhampton & Dudley rose 0.8 per cent to a record high of £14.86 amid talk financier Robert Tchennguiz has turned his attention to the pub operator.In the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed 76.4 points, or 1.2 per cent, higher at a five-year high of 6,224.5, lifted by a strong performance from Wall Street, which in turn was triggered by a flurry of takeovers.Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 gained 110.8 points, or 1 per cent, to a record high of 10,495.4.The mining sector spearheaded the FTSE 100’s advance, with the sector providing the five biggest blue chip risers. Firm metal prices and further signs of consolidation - Kinross Gold yesterday bid $3.1bn for Aim-listed Bema Gold, up 14.7 per cent to 285p - helped Antofagasta rise 4 per cent to 528½p and Anglo American climb 3.7 per cent to £25.04.ICI, the speciality chemicals company, rallied 2.7 per cent to 391¼p on speculation it might sell its Quest business and a push from Cazenove.

Its shares faded 0.6 per cent to £11.92 after Deutsche Bank drew attention to a new product from HBOS (a 125 per cent loan to value mortgage) that threatens to challenge Northern Rock’s Together offering. HBOS rose 1 per cent to £10.94Whitbread gained 2.5 per cent to a record high of £14.54, excited by reports that Starwood Capital, a US private equity group, had amassed a-near 3 per cent stake in the leisure conglomerate.Traders said Starwood was likely to have acquired its stake through a CFD and noted that the trading arm of Credit Agricole yesterday revealed a 4.5% holding in Whitbread.Separately, Starwood announced its had hired Desmond Taljaard, Whitbread’s development director, as the head of its asset management business in Europe.In the same sector. InterContinental Hotels added 2.2 per cent to £10.38 ½p on news of private equity bid approach for US rival Four Seasons.The gaming sector was in focus, as Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, confirmed it was interested in buying troubled online gaming company 888 Holdings.Ladbrokes firmed 2.6 per cent to 420¾p, 888 jumped 9 per cent to 120½p while fellow internet gamer PartyGaming was 4.5 per cent higher at 28¾p on hopes it could still get involved.However, Ivor Jones, analyst at Panmure Gordon, was not convinced that an 888 deal was the right one for Ladbrokes.He wrote: “If a takeover is being considered, we believe it is unlikely to be as attractive to Ladbrokes shareholders as the alternatives, namely the buyback we have forecast starting next year and investing in online marketing in Ladbrokes own online business. 888 has an inherently less predictable business than the core of Ladbrokes”.Great Portland Estates, the property company in talks to acquire London Merchant Securities, eased 0.1 per cent to 601½p as Morgan Stanley sold its remaining 3 per cent stake. However, traders reckon the stock could rally today as investors realise that the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation has built a 3.4 per cent stake, possibly as the prelude to a bid.IT company Misys finished unchanged at 208¼p but could also rise this morning. After the market closed, ValueAct Capital, an activist US value fund, declared an increased stake of 5.1 per cent. Mike Lawrie, the new chief of Misys, was formerly a partner at ValueAct.AGA Foodservices, gained 1.5 per cent to 396p after Panmure Gordon took the view that the company, which last week revealed details of a merger approach to rival Enodis, 0.6 per cent better to 189½p, is now a takeover target.The broker notes that ITW Middleby and Manitowoc could all be interested and that Aga’s new broker, Citigroup, has “an excellent track record of putting deals to bed in this market capitalisation space.”Meanwhile, bid target London Stock Exchange rose 1.2 per cent to £12.68 amid reports it has held talks with the Tokyo Stock Exchange about a potential alliance.Observers expect the LSE to produce its strongest earnings since its 2001 floatation when it report interims on Wednesday.Finally,Daily Mail & General Trust lost 1.3 per cent to 649½p amid reports that Morgan Stanley had placed 7.5m shares in the newspaper owner.

292;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-10-09T12:16:37Z;Disaster planning: Commerce remains vulnerable to the force of nature;;When an oil refinery near New Orleans was left 10 feet under water following Hurricane Katrina last year, it turned to a unit of Honeywell, the US conglomerate, to help it recover from the disaster.Honeywell stripped out the refinery’s damaged electronic systems and transported them to a facility in Houston for repair.But shortly after arriving in Houston, the electronics had to be moved again as Hurricane Rita bore down on the Texas coast.Their next stop was Oklahoma and then Philadelphia, where they were refurbished before being returned to the Louisiana refinery once the floodwater had receded.The episode was typical of countless salvage operations forced on businesses along the US gulf coast following Katrina and Rita.Mark Neas, vice president of Honeywell Process solutions, says the devastating hurricanes demonstrated the vulnerability of businesses to natural disasters. Honeywell is one of a growing number of companies offering disaster preparedness and recovery services as industries become increasingly aware of the need to plan for worst-case scenarios.Businesses have been focusing more attention on disaster preparedness since the 2001 terrorist attacks on the US highlighted the vulnerability of New York’s financial centre to catastrophic disruption.But last year’s hurricanes showed that nature is arguably a bigger threat to business than terrorism.While this year’s Atlantic hurricane season has been relatively quiet so far, there has been a clear trend over the past 15 years towards more frequent and powerful tropical storms.The cause of increased hurricane activity is the focus of intense debate, with some scientists blaming global warming while others attribute it to a natural cycle.But while a link between hurricanes and global warming remains unproven, a growing body of opinion supports a broader theory that climate change is causing an increase in extreme and violent weather of all kinds around the world. “It is not just the increased frequency of storms that has alarmed business, it is also the scale of destruction caused by Katrina that opened people’s eyes,” says Mr Neas.“It showed that business has to be prepared for the big one-off events that do not happen often but cause huge disruption when they do.”Honeywell’s customers included many of the oil refineries and chemical plants that were knocked out of action by Katrina – causing supply shortages and increased energy prices throughout the US.“Some of the refineries had not been as aggressive as they should have been about backing up their IT, keeping enough spare parts for replacements and generally building enough redundancy into their systems,” says Mr Neas. “Katrina was a big learning experience for us and our customers.”One of Honeywell’s main roles in preparing businesses for catastrophe is making sure critical facilities can be shut down quickly and safely when disaster strikes.Another priority is ensuring that the company’s own employees are safe.“If we cannot take care of our own people following a disaster, they cannot take care of our customers,” says Mr Neas.“After Katrina, we had project managers helping manage reconstruction of employees’ homes and administrative assistants finding places for families to live.“We had people with a personal crisis going on and we needed them helping to get chemical plants and oil refineries back up and running as quickly as possible.”Another large provider of disaster preparedness and recovery services is Pennsylvania-based SunGard, which generates $4bn of annual revenues and boasts more than 10,000 customers in North America and Europe, including 80 per cent of the Fortune 50 list of largest US companies.SunGard operates more than 3m sq ft of hardened data centres capable of keeping customers’ information technology systems running in the event that disaster strikes a critical facility.The need for redundancy to be built into IT systems has become increasingly well understood as business becomes more dependent on electronic data.But David Palermo, vice-president of marketing at SunGard, says protecting IT systems is useless unless employees can keep the business running following a disaster.SunGard keeps 20,000 seats available 24 hours a day in 60 office spaces in North America and Europe, ready to be filled by workers displaced by a disaster.Many businesses are loath to incur the cost of preparing for an event that may never happen.But for those that take a gamble, the consequences can be severe.Mr Palermo says a third of businesses struck by natural disaster fail to recover.Honeywell’s Mr Neas says few of his customers have any doubts about the value of disaster preparedness after Katrina.“When the customer saw the commitment we had to getting them back up and running it really helped strengthen our relationship with them,” he says. “It was no longer a customer-vendor relationship. It became a partnership.”

294;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-07-21T20:15:48Z;Caterpillar indicates ‘old economy’ resurgence;;The contrast between the US’s resurgent “old economy” industries and its troubled technology sector came to the fore on Friday when heavy machinery maker Caterpillar reported its best-yet quarterly earnings while personal computer maker Dell capped a bad week for technology companies with a profit warning.The divergent fortunes of two of corporate America’s most important sectors, coupled with concerns about a slowing domestic economy and tensions in the Middle East, are fuelling investor uncertainty over the direction of the stock market.All the main US share indices were down as the woes of the technology sector, with the exception of Microsoft and Google, outweighed the good news from US manufacturers with exposure to booming markets such as mining and energy.Industry experts say that some of the US’s traditional industries, aside from the ailing automotive and airline sectors, are outpacing the “new economy”, thanks to a weaker dollar, high commodity prices and a wave of consolidation and cost-cutting that has weeded out weaker players.The prediction by Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, that it is on course to record its highest annual profits and revenues in 40 years follows upbeat pronouncements by other global manufacturers such as General Electric and Honeywell.“We had a spectacular second quarter [and] we don’t see 2006 as the peak,” said Jim Owens, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive, after announcing a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to $1.5bn in the three months to June 30.The good performance, in spite of higher operating costs, prompted Caterpillar, which is seen as a bellwether for blue-chip manufacturing stocks, to lift its outlook for earnings and sales for the whole of this year. By contrast, sectors such as personal computers are resembling old maturing industries.Growth is slowing and companies have become involved in cut-throat price competition to try to increase their market share.Shares in Dell, the world’s biggest maker of PCs, fell to a five-year low during morning trading after warning that profits would not meet expectations because of heavy discounting in a softening market for PCs.Earlier this week Intel, the chipmaker, admitted that revenues would not meet its forecasts this year and were likely to be 10 per cent down after three years of double-digit growth.Shares in its rival AMD were down 10 per cent on Friday after its second-quarter sales suffered from the chip price war with Intel and slowing demand for PCs, while the search engine Yahoo disappointed Wall Street by losing further ground to Google.
295;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-04-19T22:35:54Z;Three banks to prepare Avio IPO;;Carlyle, a US private equity group, has chosen three investment banks to prepare Avio, an Italian engine parts maker, for an initial public offering that could happen before the end of the year.After weeks of speculation that Carlyle was preparing to exit the investment, the Washington-based buy-out group selected JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers and Mediobanca to underwrite any listing, people familiar with the matter said.An IPO of Avio could value the company at more than €2bn ($2.4bn). Carlyle has owned Avio since September 2003, when it joined forces with Finmeccanica, an Italian defence group, to buy the unit for €1.6bn from Fiat, an Italian carmaker.Avio is part of the current crop of Carlyle investments in the defence and aerospace sectors, where it has traditionally been strong because of its knowledge of the sector and its political connections. However, Carlyle’s ability to strike many large defence deals in recent years has been limited by high asset valuations in the industry.Other portfolio companies include Carlyle’s stake in Qinetiq, the UK’s state-owned defence and technology research company, which went public this year. Carlyle also invested in United Defense Industries, the US maker of the Bradley fighting vehicle that last year agreed a sale to the UK’s BAE Systems.The most recent new investment in the defence sector by Carlyle came last September when it agreed to buy NP Aerospace, a UK-maker of composite moulded products, for $54m.With 4,800 employees, Avio makes parts for engines used in aircraft, missiles and power generation. Its clients include General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls Royce and Honeywell. Carlyle owns 70 per cent of the group while Finmeccanica owns 30 per cent.
296;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-04-19T17:48:23Z;UTC and Honeywell cash in on aircraft boom;;Soaring global demand for commercial aircraft helped two of the world’s biggest aerospace manufacturers report above-forecast earnings on Wednesday.Both United Technologies, the diversified manufacturer of jet engines and other aerospace equipment, and Honeywell International, the world’s largest maker of cockpit electronics, saw double-digit growth in revenues and profits.As Boeing and Airbus secure orders and deliver aircraft at record levels thanks to rising passenger and freight traffic, the makers of components are also cashing in.Both Honeywell and UTC sounded a sanguine note about the rest of the year, with the former reiterating its forecast of 25 to 30 per cent revenue growth, while the latter said sales earnings per share would be up to 5.6 per cent ahead of previous estimates, on annual revenues of about $46bn.UTC also reiterated its expectations of generating cash after capital investments on par with net profits. First-quarter profits at the helicopters-to-elevators group were $768m, up 18 per cent. Per-share earnings rose 19 per cent to 76 cents. Revenues benefited from acquisitions, advancing 13 per cent to $10.6bn.UTC, which makes Sikorsky helicopters and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, generated $774m in cash after capital expenditures and bought back $375m of its own stock during the quarter.Meanwhile, Honeywell said net profits rose 22 per cent to $431m. On a per share basis, they rose 24 per cent to 52 cents, beating analysts’ forecasts.Revenues rose 12 per cent to $7.2bn, and Honeywell generated $117m in cash after capital expenditures.Honeywell’s aerospace segment saw revenues rise 5.2 per cent to $2.6bn for the quarter, with commercial sales growth overshadowing a slight decline in the defence and space division.For UTC, a six-week strike at Sikorsky, the maker of Black Hawk helicopters, caused revenues to shrink by 15.4 per cent in that division. However, the Pratt & Whitney jet-engine arm enjoyed sales growth of almost 28 per cent, as profits rose 26 per cent and the Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace equipment unit saw profits rise 19 per cent on a 13.2 per cent sales increase.The results triggered upgrades on the two companies’ stock by Prudential analysts. Shares in Honeywell edged off 1.8 per cent to $43.35 while UTC stock advanced 5.8 per cent to $62.34 in midday trading in New York. The two share prices are up about 22 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, in the past year.

Hewlett-Packard was down 1.8 per cent at $32.03 and Intel down 1.3 per cent to $19.19.Weighing on the Dow was General Electric, which fell 1.8 per cent to $33.29 after Credit Suisse cut its prices target on the stock. The note helped drag down other industrials, with 3M and Honeywell shedding 0.9 per cent to $80.26 and 1.2 per cent to $42.88 respectively.Elsewhere, the quarterly earnings season clicked into top gear, with Citigroup climbing 0.6 per cent to $48.35 after delivering a 4 per cent rise in fourth quarter profits.Wachovia, the fourth largest US bank, said lending to businesses and trading helped it achieve 7.4 per cent growth in profits for the first quarter.The bank said it earned $1.77bn excluding merger and restructuring costs in the first quarter, up from $1.65bn in the previous year. Even so, Wachovia’s shares slid 1.4 per cent to $55.05.Discount broker Charles Schwabposted a 68 per cent jump in quarterly earnings, but its shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $17.34.Among other movers, TiVo, which makes digital video recorders, was up

GE’s acquisition of the UK’s Amersham, announced in late 2003, fit that model.Danaher, which is based in Washington DC, is paying $47 per share for Sybron, valuing the target at a 13 per cent premium over its market value on Tuesday night. The deal, structured as a cash tender offer, also includes the assumption by Danaher of about $200m of Sybron debt.Danaher also said that first quarter revenues were $2.1bn, or 17.4 per cent more than the same period last year. Earnings per share for Danaher - whose businesses include industrial tools and electronic testing devices - were expected to be in the upper end of the previously estimated range of $0.61 to $0.64.Danaher’s shares moved up 1.3 per cent to $66.20 in morning trading yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of $20.3bn.Danaher was advised by lawyers at Wachtell Lipton.

It prompted hopes that stocks have broken out of their recent trading range.The rally started in afternoon trade after the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report said the US economy was growing at a steady, moderate pace with inflationary pressures contained. The report was widely taken as evidence that the central bank would soon be done with its cycle of monetary tightening.The news triggered a rally among industrial blue chips. Caterpillar surged 3.3 per cent to $74.29, while Honeywell gained 1.2 per cent to $42.85. The blue chip index also found support in DuPont, which rose 2.7 per cent to $42.81 after the chemicals manufacturer increased its first-quarter profit forecast and announced a restructuring plan.This, along with a dip in crude prices, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.52 per cent higher to 11,209.77, while the S&P 500 gained 0.43 per cent to 1,303.02 – its highest close in almost five years – and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.69 per cent to 2,311.84.“This is the first time in recent memory we have had a two-day rally,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The follow-through is important because it gets a lot of people to wake to the fact that this market is getting some life.”The railways sector was in focus after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit estimates by 20 per cent.The revised guidance prompted Merrill Lynch to raise its price estimates for Union and four other rail companies. “We believe this is a clear signal that the rail industry continues to benefit from record pricing gains and subsequent earnings leverage,” Merrill said.The S&P transportation index jumped 1.8 per cent, boosted by shares of Union, up 5.9 per cent at $90.25, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, up 6.3 per cent at $81.30 and Norfolk Southern, up 4.7 per cent at $53.92.Investors also had their eyes on the banking sector after Lehman Brothers became the second major investment bank to report record quarterly profits and revenue. First-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent but Lehman shares fell 0.8 per cent to $144.15 as investors took profits after the previous session’s gains.Bear Stearns, due to report its results today, was down 0.2 per cent to $134.21 while Morgan Stanley, which will release its figures next week, fell 0.7 per cent to $59.64.Elsewhere, Sears Holdingssurged 12.8 per cent to $132.29 after it delivered first-quarter profits that beat market expectations.Shares in CVS fell 2.8 per cent to $29.71 after the pharmacy chain said the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an informal investigation into its accounting practices.Shares in H&R Block dropped 6.2 per cent to $20.63 as the biggest tax preparer in the US became the latest company to draw the attention of the New York state attorney, Eliot Spitzer.

303;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-03-07T19:22:00Z;Interest rate fears put squeeze on US equities;;A disappointing forecast by technology bellwether Texas Instruments, combined with fears about the outlook for US interest rates, sent equities broadly lower on Tuesday.Yields on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond remained close to nine-month highs, raising worries about the effect of higher borrowing costs on corporate profit.The uncertainty in the market was exacerbated by a government report showing falling US productivity in the fourth quarter, the first decline in more than four years, and an increase in labour costs.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.8 per cent at 2,268.38 and the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent weaker at 1,275.88.But the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a rise of 0.2 per cent to 10,980.69, boosted by a rally from General Motors after the auto giant announced plans to reduce employee retirement benefits as part of a move to cut labour costs.GM shares rose 2.4 per cent to $20.29.The biggest drag on the S&P 500 was Texas Instruments, the world’s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, which lost 3.3 per cent to $31.26.The company raised the lower end of its profit forecast but failed to deliver the strong earnings outlook some investors were looking for.However, analysts at Wachovia Securities reiterated their “outperform” rating, saying that TI was their favourite large-cap stock.“Despite near-term concerns, we believe business fundamentals remain sound,” they said.Elsewhere in the sector, Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker that last week cut its revenue estimates, fell 1.2 per cent to $20.06.The telecoms sector was in focus as analysts digested the fallout from AT&T’s takeover approach for BellSouth, which would make it the biggest telecoms company in the world.Qwest Communications International fell 6.7 per cent to $6.38 after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock from “hold” to “sell”, saying an approach for the fixed-line operator – widely seen as a potential target for Verizon, the second-largest US carrier – was unlikely.Shares in Verizon fell 0.7 per cent to $33.51 amid reports the company was looking to buy Vodafone’s 45 per cent stake in the telecoms groups’ Verizon Wireless joint venture.Kroger put on 1.4 per cent to $20.15 after the largest supermarket operator in the US swung into a fourth-quarter profit.Archipelago, the electronic trading systems operator, whose shares have risen over 30 per cent this year, fell 4.3 per cent to $64.25 on the last day of trading before its merger with the New York Stock Exchange.

Having spent much of the last two years sorting out problems, tackling the corporate culture, selling off unwanted businesses and redressing years of underinvestment, Prince now needs his managers to deliver.To ram the point home he gave them all copies of Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done, the best-seller by Larry Bossidy, former chairman of Honeywell, and Ram Charan, a consultant who has done
a lot of work with Citibank over
the years.The book lays the stress on doing rather than thinking about doing; on action not strategy. It talks about the mechanics of cultural change,
a subject dear to Prince’s heart.But it also highlights the importance for leaders to possess “emotional fortitude” – in other
words, having the guts to eliminate underperformers. Citi folk are hoping that is not what Prince means by the year of execution.Sometime this month, Ron Insana will preside over his last episode as host of CNBC’s Street Signs. His departure from the anchor chair will end a 15-year run in which he helped establish CNBC as a financial news network and capitalist icon, served
as a sane voice during turbulent moments in the market and, while
he was at it, became a champion for the bald.That last accomplishment may not rank alongside other career highlights, such as his recent exclusive interview with President George W. Bush. Nonetheless, Insana’s decision to ditch his toupee seven years ago revealed a streak of boldness – particularly for a television personality – and only added to his popularity on Wall Street, where traders take “haircuts” on a daily basis.“It was probably the best thing I ever did, appearance-wise,” Insana told the AP in 2002. “If you’re confident and have self-esteem,
the externals don’t matter.”CNBC is keeping mum on Insana’s replacement, although the smart money is betting that he or she will have a thick, David Faber-like mane of hair.Follicularly challenged fans will
still have the opportunity to see Insana during occasional appearances on the network as a senior analyst. Otherwise, they will have to make

How else can one explain the decision by the authorities at the Tower of London to order the six famous ravens who live at the fortress indoors?The black birds – named Branwen, Hugine, Munin, Gwyllum, Thor and Baldrick – are now tucked up safely in a special aviary. Derrick Coyle,
the Yeoman raven-master, says the measure is “the safest thing to do for their own protection”.But Observer’s man lurking in the dungeon senses that there is more to it than that. The fate of the House of Windsor, it is said, hangs on that of the ravens as – according to legend – should the birds ever flee the Tower, the monarchy will fall.Caring for the birds seems to be another example of that deft sense of self-preservation that has kept the British royal family going for so
many centuries."
305;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-02-15T18:36:24Z;BHP buyback cheers FTSE;;Barclays received a knock on Wednesday on fears that the bank was poised to embark on the acquisition trail.Having lagged behind for most of 2005, UK bank stocks have been on a good run of late, largely driven by talk of consolidation, with Barclays, Lloyds and Standard Chartered all rumoured to have attracted interest from overseas buyers.Since the start of November, the FTSE All-Share banking index has risen 14.6 per cent compared with a rise of 10.7 per cent for the wider market.However, Barclays bucked that recent trend yesterday, slipping 1.1 per cent to 649½p as Fox-Pitt, Kelton reiterated its “underperform” rating ahead of the bank’s full-year results on February 21.Michael Helsby, analyst, said a good performance from Barclays Capital, its investment banking arm, was already priced in, while it was likely the recent improvement in its retail banking division would run out of steam. “We are also concerned that Barclays might embark on a meaningful acquisition,” Mr Helsby said.Ahead of its results today, Bradford & Bingley marked time at 450½p.In the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed flat at 5,791.5, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 14.3 points, or 0.2 per cent to 9,334.6. Volume was average, with 3.1bn shares changing hands.BHP Billiton climbed 0.8 per cent to 962p on record first-half profits and news of a $2bn share buyback. Charles Goodyear, chief executive, said he expected no slowdown in the demand for metals and energy.The news boosted others in the sector including Kazakhmys, up 3.2 per cent to 837p, and Lonmin, 4.6 per cent higher at £21.26.Smiths Group rose 1.8 per cent to 944½p amid speculation that Honeywell of the US was running the rule over the engineering company.BAA made headway as investors awaited a potential bid from Spain’s Ferrovial for the airport operator, which could be valued at £15bn, including debt. Shares in BAA reached a record high of 828p, before closing up 4 per cent at 810½p.PartyGaming added 1.2 per cent to 125p after settling its legal dispute with fellow online gambling company Empire Online. Numis Securities upped its stance on the stock from “hold” to “add” and said the litigation had weighed on the stock. Empire Online fell 7.6 per cent to 124¾p.Plans for a smoking ban in pubs and clubs had no dramatic impact on tobacco stocks or pub operators.Goldman Sachs said it expected a slight fall in cigarette sales but said the leading groups had already communicated the impact such a ban would have. Imperial Tobacco rose 1.1 per cent to £17.52.KBC Peel Hunt added that the inclusion of private member clubs in the ban meant pubs would not be disadvantaged. Punch Taverns fell 0.4 per cent to 853p but Mitchells & Butlers rose 0.4 per cent to 395p.British Land lost 0.7 per cent to £11.90 amid talk that Citigroup had placed 3.2m shares in the property company at about £11.90 a share.Cable & Wireless eased 0.2 per cent to 105½p after Morgan Stanley poured cold water on the bid speculation that has surrounded the telecommunications company.“We believe that a break up or demerger of C&W would be difficult, and could struggle to deliver substantial value,” Morgan Stanley said.HMV eased 1 per cent to 189½p in spite of news that US fund manager Brandes has continued to build its stake in the music and books retailer. Brandes, which first declared a 3.1 per cent holding in HMV last October, bought 472,900 shares, taking its stake in HMV to 9.2 per cent.Scottish Power fell 1.8 per cent to 577p as the stock traded without the right to the latest dividend payout. Also trading ex-dividend was GlaxoSmithKline which lost 1.4 per cent to £14.66.Colt Telecom fell 2.5 per cent to 67¾p after Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein cut its rating from “buy” to “hold” and said that investor expectations have risen too high ahead of its fourth-quarter results due on February 23.Cattles, the consumer lending group, rose 5.2 per cent to 328¼p after Citigroup initiated coverage with a “buy” rating and a 385p target price.Media group Emap rose 2.1 per cent to 910p after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to £10 from 900p and said its low rating could attract a bid approach.
306;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-02-03T22:46:45Z;Wall Street throws the book at Amazon;;Amazon, the online retailer, became the latest internet company to disappoint investors after poorly-received figures from search engine Google earlier this week.Amazon shares plunged more than 10 per cent to $38.33 yesterday as its fourth-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations. Sales missed the target, earnings were sharply lower as aggressive discounts over the holiday period cut into margins, while its earnings forecast for the full year was lower than hoped.Anthony Noto, analyst at Goldman Sachs, cut his price target on the stock by up to $9 to $34-$38 and said the news “reinforced long-term concerns regarding structural issues with Amazon’s business model that are limiting growth in some categories and resulting in rising costs of growth”.Gateway further added to the technology sector’s woes after it also failed to meet analysts’ earnings expectations. Its shares slumped 13 per cent to $2.42 as Bear Stearns slashed its rating to “underperform”.Overall, the Nasdaq Composite index closed down 0.8 per cent at 2,262.58 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each fell 0.5 per cent to 10,793.62 and 1,264.03, respectively.For the week, the Dow fell 1 per cent, the S&P dropped 1.5 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 1.8 per cent.The pullback capped a difficult week on Wall Street, which had to content with, among other things, mixed earnings results and the prospect of further rises in US interest rates following Tuesday’s Federal Reserve meeting.“This week’s trading, particularly the latter part of the week, has largely been driven by broadening fears of inflation,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Concerns that the Federal Reserve would further raise interest rates in March, and possibly again in May or June, were heightened by yesterday’s non-farm payroll numbers showing a higher-than-expected increase in hourly wages.The data suggested the labour market was tightening, which could lead to higher inflation.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said while higher wage growth could be good for the economy in the long run, in the short term, wage-induced inflation would have adverse effects on US equities since the Fed would be forced to continue its cycle of monetary tightening.“Not only would the cost of borrowing go up for corporate America but an interest rate increase would also make the fixed income market more attractive, drawing money out of stocks,” he said.Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries about decelerating earnings growth after several sector bellwethers delivered mixed results.On the Dow, record quarterly earnings at ExxonMobil drove shares in the oil giant up 0.2 per cent higher for the week at $61.39, while aerospace group Boeing rose 4.2 per cent to $71.17 after it more than doubled its quarterly profit and raised earnings guidance.However, the strong performances were offset by sharp losses in Altria, down 5.2 per cent at $70.87, and Citigroup, down 3.9 per cent at $45.06.On Nasdaq, Google learned the perils of high expectations this week after an earnings increase that fell shy of investors’ hopes sent shares plummeting more than 16 per cent, or over $20bn, in after-hours trading on Tuesday.Although the numbers largely met analysts’ forecasts, investors have become accustomed to the company trumping such predictions. The stock managed to recover part of its losses however ending the week 12 per cent lower at $381.55.Elsewhere, January retail sales gave a lift to coffee chain Starbucks and clothing retailer Gap. The former jumped 6 per cent to $33.88, while the latter gained 7.2 per cent to $18.63 for the week.By contrast, the auto parts sector was under pressure following weaker-than-expected quarterly figures from Goodyear Tire & Rubber. The stock skidded 19.4 per cent to $15.21 over the five sessions, making it the worst performer on the S&P.Industrial group Honeywell was the best performer on the Dow, up 3.8 per cent after Citigroup upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy”..
307;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-01-27T00:08:35Z;Honeywell earnings up 107% for quarter;;The global aerospace boom has driven Honeywell to its strongest performance since its failed 2001 takeover by General Electric as earnings more than doubled.Fourth quarter results for the US industrial conglomerate beat expectations, with earnings per share up 107 per cent to 62 cents or $520m. Sales rose 10 per cent to $7.3bn and Honeywell increased its guidance for performance this year.But the turnaround of a company only recently dogged with slow growth and expensive asbestos liabilities has failed to ignite much enthusiasm among shareholders. Shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $37.41 on Thursday, helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average recover some of the losses it made after GE’s disappointing numbers last Friday.Executives concede it has been difficult to persuade investors that the turnaround is lasting. “Our trading multiple has come up but it’s still below the average of our peers and is particularly low on a forward basis,” said finance director Dave Anderson in an interview. “We are slowly building confidence - one quarter at a time - and we think it is eventually going to be noticed by the market.”One weak spot in the fourth quarter was slow growth in the turbocharger business, which had previously benefitted from the adoption of diesel engines in the European car market.The company has also come under pressure from analysts to justify the price paid for some recent acquisitions - most recently First Technology, a UK company which Honeywell is buying for £406m ($727m) after a bidding war with rival US manufacturer Danaher.Citing UK Takeover Code restrictions, Honeywell declined to detail its synergy estimates, but said the deal should meet its internal requirements for becoming earnings-enhancing by the second year.Instead, the company focused on the strong growth in its aerospace and automation and controls businesses and a successful restructuring of its speciality materials division.It raised its 2006 earnings estimates by five cents per share at the low end of the range due to lower-than-expected pension costs, and predicted sales of more than $30bn.
308;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-01-26T21:57:42Z;Caterpillar does the heavy lifting on Wall Street;;Earnings from a host of leading companies, including six constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, contributed to a strong performance on Wall Street.Among the best performers was Caterpillar as the heavy machinery group capped a year of “unprecedented customer demand” by raising its earnings forecast for 2006. Caterpillar shares gained 5 per cent to $65.17.Also raising guidance for the year, after reporting a surge in quarterly earnings, was Lockheed Martin, the defence group. Its shares rose 3 per cent to $66.99.More sobering was news of a large quarterly loss at General Motors. The ailing carmaker lost 3.4 per cent to $23.05 after reporting fourth-quarter losses of $4.8bn, which contributed to its largest annual deficit since 1992. GM remains the best-performing Dow stock this year, up almost 19 per cent, albeit from a low base.Overall, it was a strong day for equity markets, helped by a robust performance from the financial services sector. The S&P 500 financial services index rose almost 2 per cent.The Dow ended 0.9 per cent higher at 10,809.47, which took the index back above the level at which it began the year. The S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,273.82 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1 per cent to 2,283.00.The rally was helped by the latest batch of economic data that revealed durable goods orders rose more than expected in December and the number of unemployment claimants remained low.Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards & Sons, said: “The market had to digest a lot and that reached a climax on Friday [when US stocks fell sharply]. But I think we are now back into the dominant trend, which is up.”He also said signs of weakness in the US housing market could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates sooner rather than later, which would please investors.In other earnings news, engineering group Honeywell International gained 3.7 per cent to $37.41 thanks to strong demand for its aircraft parts and services.Telecommunications group AT&T rose 1.2 per cent to $25.51 after solid quarterly earnings. Tellabs surged 19.6 per cent to $12.57 after the telecoms equipment maker forecast a rise in first-quarter earnings.However, Apple Computer lost 2.5 per cent to $72.33 as Bear Stearns said search engine Google was working on a rival to Apple’s iTunes download service.Brunswick slumped 13 per cent to $36.04 in spite of higher quarterly earnings as the pleasure-boat maker gave disappointing guidance.There was a sparkling debut for Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain in which McDonald’s has a large stake. Priced at $22, the share doubled in value to end at $44.
309;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-01-26T18:42:56Z;Global overview: Nikkei leads share gains;;Sentiment-boosting news from earnings supported a rally on global stock markets on Thursday.Robust economic data in the US and a stabilisation of oil prices also helped steady market nerves after the sharp correction in equities seen last week.The most notable performance came in Tokyo where shares found support as the impact of the controversy over the investigation of internet company Livedoor continued to fade.The Nikkei 225 Average rallied 1.5 per cent or 240 points to 15,891.02, its best close since January 16. The broader Topix index rose 24.83, or 1.5 per cent, to 1,643.29.In Europe, equities rallied with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rising 0.99 per cent or 12.76 points to 1303.94.In the US, there were broad gains on the back of strong earnings reports from heavyweight stocks, including Caterpillar, Verizon, AT&T and Honeywell.This countered some recent disappointments from high-profile stocks early in the fourth-quarter earnings season.The troubled General Motors went against the positive trend as the carmaker reported a fourth-quarter loss of nearly $5bn. GM’s shares dropped by about 7 per cent.By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent at 10,803.39. The broader S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent to 1,275.18 and the Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.8 per cent to 2,278.57.The impact of GM on the US market was starkly illustrated in earnings data from Thomson Financial.The company said that, of the 41 per cent of S&P 500 constituents that had so far reported fourth quarter earnings, 64 per cent have beaten expectations, 18 per cent had matched forecasts and 19 per cent had disappointed.Overall, the S&P 500 companies were expected to deliver 13.6 per cent earnings growth in the fourth quarter, according to consensus forecasts for results. This was roughly in line with prior expectations.However, David Dropsey, research analyst at Thomson Financial, said that, if GM’s results were excluded, the earnings growth estimate would rise to 14.8 per cent.“We are seeing another strong quarter of earnings that the market is yet to fully recognise,” he said.For 2006, Thomson Financial said the S&P 500 constituents were forecast to deliver 12.6 per cent earnings growth. This put the market on a rolling 12-month forward price-earnings multiple of 14.8 times.The better corporate news was reinforced by some strong economic data. Orders for US-made durable goods rose by a better-than-forecast 1.3 per cent in December while claims for state jobless aid rose by 11,000 last week to 283,000, well short of the 305,000 forecast by economists.“With three sub-300k numbers in the past four weeks, it is beginning to look as though there has been a real improvement in the labour market at the start of this year,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.The economic news triggered a widespread sell-off in bond markets. US Treasury yields rose to a high for the month while gilts also came under pressure.Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for US GDP growth in the fourth quarter from 3.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent in the wake of the data. “Getting an outcome anywhere near this would be astounding in a quarter where consumer spending growth appears to have been near zero,” its economists said.

311;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Engelhard for sale as board rejects BASF bid;;Engelhard, the US manufacturer of catalysts and pigments, on Monday put itself up for sale as its board rejected an all-cash takeover offer worth $4.9bn from BASF, the much larger German chemicals group.The move will put pressure on BASF to decide whether it wants to raise its bid and potentially enter a competitive auction, bow out of the takeover battle, or maintain its current offer and hope that Engelhard fails to find an alternative buyer.Launched on January 3, BASF’s $37 a share offer for Engelhard ranks as one of the largest ever hostile bids attempted by a European company in the US.Taking over Engelhard would allow BASF to gain a meaningful presence in the market for catalysts, which has been growing rapidly as governments around the world have moved to tighten regulations on vehicle emissions.Engelhard said on Monday that BASF’s bid was “inadequate” because it understated the cost savings in a merger and valued the company too cheaply compared with other transactions in the speciality chemicals sector.In addition, Engelhard said that third parties had expressed interest in the company, which could lead to a higher offer.In an interview with the Financial Times on Monday night, Barry Perry, Engelhard chief executive, said that several parties, both “financial” and “strategic”, had been in contact with the company about a counter-bid.“Our goal now is to maximise shareholder value”, he added.Some industry observers have pointed to Honeywell, Dow Chemical and DuPont as potential buyers of Engelhard, which is based in New Jersey and posted annual sales of $4.1bn in 2004, generating net income of $235m. Private equity groups, which have in recent years made a number of investments in chemicals businesses, are likely to take a look.One Engelhard shareholder suggested that several Chinese companies might be interested in making a move. Engelhard recently bought the syngas catalyst business of Nanjing Chemical Industry Corporation, a subsidiary of one of China’s largest integrated energy and chemical companies. This technology allows for the production of petrol from coal and natural gas.Ahead of Engelhard’s announcement last night, the company’s shares closed up 0.3 per cent at $39.71. Engelhard share price had for years had lingered below $33.At those levels, investors appear to be betting that Engelhard’s plans to run an auction will be successful or at least force BASF to raise its bid, which expires on February 6.Jürgen Hambrecht, BASF chief executive, has already indicated that his company may be willing to raise its bid to $38 a share if it is given access to Engelhard’s books.In recent years, Engelhard has sought to transform itself from a stodgy manufacturer into a producer of high margin products such as diesel-emission control and energy and fuel materials. “These actions have positioned us to generate strong earnings growth over the next several years,” said Mr Perry.Bankers at Merrill Lynch and lawyers at Cahill Gordon will be overseeing the auction on behalf of Engelhard.
312;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-01-23T15:24:34Z;January 23: Vodafone set to ring the changes?;;January 23: You have to marvel at some companies’ determination to put a gloss on bad news. Today Ian Gowrie-Smith, founder and chairman of SkyePharma, bowed to massive shareholder pressure and announced his resignation. Yet, according to the company’s statement he had been planning to step down since early last year. He just never quite got around to it. You can catch up on the background with Lisa Urquhart’s excellent work in Saturday’s paper. The stock is up 3½ per cent.The battle for control of First Technology promises to hot up. Danaher, the Washington-based toolmaker which bid 330p on Friday, has bought more shares in the gas sensor and crash test dummies group, lifting its stake to 19½ per cent. Honeywell, meanwhile, is “considering whether to raise its offer”. It bid 275p last month and seemed to have First Technology in the bag. Today, First Technology shares trade are changing hands at about 350p.The big story of the week, however, is Vodafone and the mounting pressure shareholders are exerting on Arun Sarin, chief executive. Listeners to Jeff Randall’s Weekend Business will have heard me predict on New Year’s Day that he probably wouldn’t survive the year as CEO. It’s too early to know whether I’ll be right or not, but it doesn’t look good. For the latest, read our story from this morning and our report in tomorrow’s paper. To catch up on the background, read Mark Odell’s piece of late November (since when things have got even worse). Tomorrow, Vodafone publishes its key performance indicators for the third quarter. They won’t be good.More coming, also, on Sir Victor Blank’s impending appointment as chairman of Lloyds TSB.

Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

But Fred Westlake, First Technology chairman, said Danaher’s 330p-a-share offer represented not just a substantial premium to Honeywell but “a superior strategic fit” for the business. First Technology shares jumped 27.4 per cent to 351p as the market appeared to expect a further round of counter-offers between the two US corporations.Both groups are keen to acquire the UK company’s world-leading gas detection products.It also emerged that Hg Capital, a private equity business, had made an initial approach to First Technology.Honeywell declined to comment but analysts said the undertakings lined up by Danaher were weak enough to allow Honeywell back into the bidding. Aberforth Partners, with 10 per cent of First Technology shares, has given Danaher a binding undertaking. Danaher also has contractual undertakings from a further 8 per cent of shareholders to sell to the Washington-based handtool maker.But Morley, with 9.9 per cent of the shares, has given other suitors seven days from the tabling of Danaher’s offer – expected next week – to make a revised offer. It will then back a further Danaher counter-offer if it is at least 5 per cent higher. Meanwhile, Sterling Investment Group, Artemis Investment Management and Jupiter Asset Management, which between them hold 13 per cent of the shares, are pledged to back Honeywell if it matches any competing offer.Jonathan Hurn, analyst with Bridgewell Securities, said the scene was now set for “two weeks of intense activity, with a competing offer from Honeywell possibly coming as early as next week”. David Larkham, analyst with Arden Partners, said there was achance Honeywell could “pay above the current price, and it won’t be over then.”First Technology broke banking covenants and issued three successive profit warnings last year. It made a pre-tax loss of £20.6m in the 12 months to October 31 on turnover of £79.1m, after a sharp drop in sales of automotive products.DrKW is acting as financial adviser for First Technology.
315;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2006-01-20T20:44:49Z;Lombard: Why UK minnows appeal to US giants;;The playbook – as the Americans would call it – for US bids for UK industrial companies is pretty well-thumbed by now, and Danaher, which on Friday trumped Honeywell’s bid for First Technology, has written a couple of its chapters.First principle of interest to investors: keep a close eye on undervalued European companies sitting on valuable technology.Honeywell, Danaher and others seem to be making a habit of bolting on companies active in complementary areas. Second principle: do not assume that the opening offer – or even the counter-bid – will be the last word.Danaher, a Washington DC-based manufacturer of industrial tools, instruments and components, has been here before. In 2004, it exercised second-mover advantage over a compatriot by stepping in with a successful counter-bid for Linx Printing Technologies, a UK manufacturer of high-speed printing equipment that had previously accepted an offer from Illinois Tool Works. Danaher’s bid was pitched at a 17 per cent premium to ITW’s.Its offer for First Technology, which makes gas sensors and crash-test dummies, is 20 per cent higher than Honeywell’s.First Technology, like Linx, had a summer marred by a profit warning and then a winter of bid talks. Its fragile financial state is one reason why this bid is unlikely to follow the pattern of last year’s takeover battle for Domnick Hunter, the UK filtration technology company.Shareholders there found themselves in the middle of a contest between Parker Hannifin and its American rival Eaton, which only finished after six price increases had added a further 16 per cent to the original offer and left Parker with the prize. But Domnick Hunter was in better shape than First Technology.While shareholders would be wise to sit tight for a possible Honeywell counter-offer, they should not expect this fight to last many rounds.Managers that disappoint their shareholders are inviting trouble. Managers that disappoint repeatedly are inviting execution.The saga at SkyePharma, the pharmaceuticals company, is turning into a case study in how not to handle a company in the admittedly choppy waters of drug development.Analysts think Flutiform, Skye- Pharma’s asthma treatment, has promise. But by failing last year to get a licensing deal for the drug and then launching a deeply discounted rights issue to self-fund the product through the next stage of trials, management sacrificed the confidence of a group of large shareholders. Their disgruntlement was whipped into dissent by the disappearance both of a formal offer and then the much-touted alternatives last week and, finally, by the management’s attempt to appoint two new executives, allegedly without consultation. Now, dubbing themselves the Requisitionists, the dissident shareholders have launched a plan to oust Ian Gowrie-Smith, chairman.Activism sometimes has a bad name. But this attempt is more than mere self-interested interference.The shareholders say they have lined up Bob Thian, an experienced pharmaceuticals executive, to replace Mr Gowrie-Smith. He would presumably move quickly to appoint a new chief executive. SkyePharma has the products. Now what it needs is an injection of experience and a transfusion of new blood.Business often depicts itself as sinking in a swamp of regulation, assailed by acronyms. Last year’s pan-European Thomson/Extel survey of investment professionals indicated marked concern – particularly on the part of UK quoted companies – about the difficulties of communicating the effect of the switch to International Financial Reporting Standards and the degree of change that the new regime was likely to inflict.But once IFRS are bedded down at British companies, the new standards – combined with European regulation to improve transparency and voluntary adoption of an operating and financial review – should provide opportunities for companies to explain themselves better.Investment relations directors who gathered at a conference organised by Real IR magazine this week said they had spent much of the past year simply educating shareholders about the changes imposed by IFRS.But in due course, the improved comparability of accounts should mean that investors and analysts come to meetings better-informed about the nuts and bolts of company performance.Rather than laboriously having to unpick historical numbers, companies should be able to spend more time explaining what they are doing and why. Of course, shareholders are unlikely to let any IR director get away with peddling flim-flam in place of hard data – but it is at least heartening to hear business talking in positive terms about what may lie on the other side of the regulatory swamp.

This 25-year-old banker at JP Morgan Cazenove has been suspended after sending emails from his office computer in which he discusses his sexual encounters. In one, a friend salutes his boasts by calling him “immi the pimp Daddy”. I’m afraid that’s all I’ll tell you about them, though. We discussed it in the newsroom and decided not to publish them. They’re pretty silly.A group of SkyePharma shareholders has called an EGM to oust Ian Gowrie-Smith, the company’s chairman and founder. The group, representing 13 per cent of the stock, is led by North Atlantic Value and includes Morley and Insight. They want to replace Gowrie-Smith with Bob Thian, who is a veteran of the pharmaceuticals industry but is currently chairman of Southern Water and Whatman. Over the past few months, several shareholders have voiced disappointment with the management team, for example over its failure to win a licensing deal for Flutiform. They have also voiced their concern about the subsequent deeply discounted rights issue to self-fund the product through Phase III trials. The more recent mess over whether the company was being bid for or not has only added to their concerns.Another great story: a bidding war has erupted for First Technology, maker of crash test dummies. The company had already been bid for by Honeywell at the end of last year. Now, another American, Danaher, has offered £251m, trumping the earlier bid by £44m. Danaher is offering 330p a share but First Technology shares are up just over 72p at 347.6p. Two American’s bidding against each other for a rather overlooked British engineer has echoes of last year’s battle for Domnick Hunter.Two other situations to keep a close eye on: F&C Asset Management shares are up 10 per cent on bid rumours, and London Stock Exchange shares are up another 29p at 705.5p on hopes Nasdaq will bid. As I said yesterday, I think they’re interested. And you can read more about it tonight on FT.com in John Authers’ On Wall Street column.

However, the Nasdaq Composite index missed out on the rally. The index finished 0.1 per cent, or 2.41 points, lower at 2,262.59, weighed down by a slump in shares of Apple Computer.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach said the rally was a follow-through from the Federal Reserver’s dovish statement on Tuesday.With the Fed signalling that further rate rises would depend on economic data, Mr Cardillo said bulls took heart from news of lower import prices and a record trade deficit – data which was interpreted as signalling that inflationary pressures might be lessening.The bond market certainly saw it that way. Bond yields fell sharply as investors began betting more strongly that the cycle of monetary tightening would end sooner rather than later.Shares in rate-sensitive stocks such as homebuilders jumped, with the Philadelphia Homebuilding index gaining 1.9 per cent.Industrial blue chips were the day’s top performers. Shares in Boeing rose to an all-time high after the aerospace giant beat rival Airbus to win a 115-plane order, valued at up to $18bn, from Qantas Airways, Australia’s biggest carrier.After finishing Tuesday’s session at $70.59 Boeing advanced another 1.2 per cent to $71.45. Its shares have risen 40.6 per cent this year, taking strength from steady plane sales.Fellow Dow component Honeywell International jumped 4.5 per cent to $37.50 after it reiterated its profit outlook for 2005 while raising its sales guidance for fiscal 2006.Technology stocks, however, were under pressure after two brokers downgraded Apple Computer. Shares in the iPod maker slumped 4 per cent to $72.01 after Bear Stearns and Banc of America both cut their ratings, citing valuation concerns.On the deals front, Anteon International surged more than $13, or 32.5 per cent, to $54.02 after defence contractor General Dynamics said that it would buy the information technology provider for $2.2bn, or $55.50 a share. Shares in General Dynamics declined 0.4 per cent to $111.68.Deal talk also swirled in the utilities sector, with FPL Group reportedly in talks to buy Constellation Energy in a deal valued at more than $11bn.FPL inched up 0.3 per cent to $43, while Constellation jumped 8.6 per cent to $61.10.
318;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-12-14T20:09:05Z;Brussels has not done enough in merger reform;;"The European Court of First Instance (CFI) on Wednesday upheld the 2001 decision by Mario Monti, the then European Union competition commissioner, to prohibit a merger of General Electric and Honeywell in spite of “manifest errors of assessment” by the Commission. The GE/Honeywell case and three subsequent court defeats on merger decisions led Brussels to embark on a reform of its merger review process.Now Neelie Kroes, Mr Monti’s successor, wants more powers to oversee all large mergers even if they affect companies within a single country. Should she have her way? In spite of the reforms introduced in May 2004, European merger control risks standing in the way of corporate restructuring made necessary by globalisation.Globalisation enlarges and integrates markets. The result is that the size of a company becomes critical in some sectors and the allocation of capital that was efficient before the wave of globalisation is so no longer. Mergers are a prime instrument of restructuring for companies to compete and survive. However, consolidation may endanger competition, which drives economic efficiency and consumer welfare.The role of merger control is precisely to avoid potential harm to consumers. To be effective it must be speedy, rigorous, fair and predictable. The Commission’s procedure has improved dramatically over the years but still fares unevenly. In 2002 the CFI overturned prohibition decisions in the cases of Airtours/First Choice, Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval/Sidel.The subsequent reforms include a revised substantive test, more checks and balances, publication of merger guidelines and the creation of the Office of the Chief Economist. These developments align the EU with US policy and practice, reduce uncertainty for the merging parties and raise the standard of economic analysis. Nonetheless, European procedure may still put obstacles in the way of takeovers. In the Schneider/Legrand case a completed takeover was blocked by the Commission and had to be undone, only for the decision to be overturned by the CFI. In the EU, unlike in the US, the takeover proceeds while being examined by the competition authority.Brussels took more than two months to decide on jurisdiction in the unsolicited takeover of Endesa, the Spanish utility, by Gas Natural – the decision, although technical, had to be taken by all 25 members of the Commission. The result of such flaws may be to raise the cost of mergers, in particular of hostile takeovers, where time is of the essence. It would be ironic if European merger control ended up protecting incumbents from hostile bids and preventing necessary restructuring. This would put EU-based companies at a disadvantage to their US counterparts.Ms Kroes’ request for the Commission to have more flexibility in obtaining jurisdiction over large mergers is intended to ensure consistency of treatment. Whether the thresholds for allocating merger jurisdiction among competition authorities should be modified is a complex issue on which little academic research has been done. The true challenge for both national and EU competition authorities is to allow the restructuring required by globalisation, while extending competition as well as the market for corporate control.Countries that allow unrestrained exercise of market power at home are shooting themselves in the foot; the best school for international competitiveness is a high degree of domestic rivalry. The example of Santander and BBVA, the internationally successful Spanish banks – formed out of a domestic consolidation process – follows from the early financial liberalisation and increase in competition in Spain.More powers and flexibility for Brussels may imply more scope for delays and lobbying. The 2004 merger reform has not gone far enough. For the competition authority to have more discretion, more checks and balances must be implemented and the scope for influence by pressure groups reduced. One idea is to establish an administrative panel that would make a public recommendation on merger decisions to the 25 commissioners. This would separate the internal team of investigators and prosecutors from the judges or decision-makers. The commissioners could still overturn the panel’s recommendation but they should give a reason.Failing a move in this direction, Ms Kroes’ request for more discretion may backfire and put on the agenda the creation of an independent European competition agency, perhaps in the mode of the US Federal Trade ­Commission.The writer is professor of economics and finance at Iese Business School and at Insead (on leave)"
319;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Court upholds EU ban on GE-Honeywell merger;;Europe’s top antitrust regulator won an important victory on Wednesday when the European Union’s second-highest court backed its controversial 2001 decision to block GE’s $45bn takeover of Honeywell, the biggest industrial deal ever proposed.At the time, the European Commission’s decision to kill off an all-US deal - even though it had won clearance from US regulators - came under heavy fire from US politicians and businessmen.Brussels’ tough line did much to cement the Commission’s reputation as an interventionist regulator keen to cross swords with powerful businesses from around the world.However, Wednesday’s confirmation of the GE/Honeywell ruling was marred by the judges’ finding that the Commission had committed a string of errors in its justification of the merger prohibition.The Luxembourg-based European Court of First Instance was especially critical of the Commission’s use of a controversial theory known as “conglomerate effects”, which allows the regulator to block mergers between groups with few overlapping businesses.Several antitrust lawyers said the court’s decision would make it unlikely that the Commission would use the theory to justify merger prohibitions in the future.However, they also argued that the regulator’s victory would boost Brussels’ confidence in future merger cases. The court’s backing, they added, would also go some way towards eradicating the embarrassment suffered by the regulator in 2002, when three of its merger prohibitions were overturned by the court in rapid succession.Those defeats led to sweeping reforms of the Commission’s merger review process, and forced the regulator to adopt a much more cautious approach towards blocking big deals.Wednesday’s ruling was especially critical of the Commission’s argument that bundling the two groups’ products would allow GE/Honeywell to dominate certain segments of the aerospace sector. The court also found that the regulator had overstated the risks that might arise from combining GE’s financial muscle with Honeywell’s strong position in the market for aviation electronics.Nevertheless, these mistakes were outweighed by what the court said were justified concerns over the combined group’s dominance in the markets for engines for large regional aircraft, corporate jet aircraft and small marine gas turbines.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, welcomed the ruling, and promised to “consider carefully what lessons may be learned from this judgement for our future merger policy”.Seizing on the court’s criticism of the Commission prohibition, GE also welcomed the court’s decision. Hendrik Bourgeois, the group’s senior counsel in Brussels, said: “We are very pleased that the court agreed with us on the issues that were of importance to us and that were the reasons why we brought the appeal - namely the Commission’s analysis on conglomerate effects.”Catriona Hatton, a partner at law firm Hogan & Hartson in Brussels, said: “The Court’s judgement raises the bar in terms of the burden of proof on the Commission in blocking…future mergers where there is no or no significant overlap between the parties’ activities.”
320;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-12-13T18:14:31Z;GE-Honeywell proposal gets its day in court;;On July 3 2001, the European Commission took a decision that shocked corporate America, defied the US government and turned a quiet Italian economist into an instant worldwide celebrity.It was the day Mario Monti announced he would block General Electric’s proposed $45bn takeover of Honeywell.The deal, the largest industrial takeover ever attempted, had already been cleared by US regulators. Yet Mr Monti, the European Union’s competition commissioner, shrugged off the evident alarm that his dissenting ruling would cause.The takeover, he announced in Brussels, “would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry” and had to be blocked.On Wednesday, more than four years after Mr Monti uttered those words, his decision will have to withstand the ultimate test.The European Court of First Instance, the Union’s second-highest court, is due to decide whether the Commission’s merger prohibition was lawful or not.It is impossible to predict the outcome of Wednesday’s ruling.Some argue that the verdict is in any case largely of historical interest. The two companies, after all, have no plans to revive their merger. The Commission, meanwhile, has radically overhauled its merger review regime since 2001, following a spate of court defeats a year after the GE/Honeywell decision. It has strengthened its internal checks and balances and significantly improved the economic analysis it conducts on deals.That means that, whatever criticism emerges from Wednesday’s ruling, the Commission will be able to claim with some justification that it has already put its house in order.It can also point out that many senior officials involved in the GE/Honeywell decision have since left the Brussels competition directorate – not least Mr Monti himself, who was last year replaced by Neelie Kroes. Mr Monti is joining join Goldman Sachs as an international adviser, it was announced on Tuesday.Yet despite these changes, anti-trust specialists argue that the regulator will find it difficult to shrug off defeat. As Michael Reynolds, the head of Allen & Overy’s international antitrust practice, says: “It would have the effect of making the Commission certainly more circumspect and careful in its analysis of other mergers. It would not want to take particular risks.”Mr Reynolds points out that the Commission became much more “conservative” and reluctant to block big deals after 2002, when three of its merger prohibitions were overturned: “If this case was to go against the Commission I would certainly expect a similar effect. The case is simply too big to ignore.”Lawyers and antitrust officials will also scrutinise Wednesday’s ruling carefully to see whether the court has sunk the final nail into the coffin of “conglomerate effects” – the controversial legal theory used by the Commission to justify blocking the GE dealOne of the peculiarities of the case was that the two groups had few overlapping businesses.Normally, regulators are only concerned about the anti-competitive impact of a deal when the companies involved manufacture the same kind of product or sell the same type of service.The Commission therefore argued that the deal would hurt competition because of the combined group’s ability to bundle its products together and sell them as a package.In the case of GE and Honeywell, the resulting rise in market power – the “conglomerate effects” – would be so great that the new group would be able to undermine competition in parts of the aerospace sector.It is a theory that has lost much of its sparkle since GE/Honeywell.While the European Court of Justice ruled this year that there was in principle nothing wrong with the concept of “conglomerate effects”, it stressed that the Commission must have absolutely watertight evidence to back it up.Some lawyers believe that if the Commission is found to have failed that test in GE/Honeywell, there is little chance of it ever resurrecting the theory.Companies with limited business overlaps would, in other words, face a much diminished risk from the Commission in the future.However, as Paul McGeown, a partner at Linklaters, argues, this reasoning cuts both ways: “In contrast, a Commission victory could whet the Commission’s appetite for testing conglomerate effects in appropriate cases,” he says.A defeat for the Commission would also bring late satisfaction to US businessmen and politicians, who were aghast that Brussels would dare to block an all-American merger that was waved through by US regulators.Paul O’Neill, the US Treasury secretary at the time, described Mr Monti’s ruling as simply “off the wall”.But the feelings of sweet revenge would undoubtedly be felt most keenly by the man who staked much of his towering reputation on completing the deal.For Jack Welch, the former GE chief executive, the takeover of Honeywell was to be the crowning achievement of his extraordinary career. He had promised to postpone his retirement to see the deal through, and he was bitterly disappointed when he was thwarted by Mr Monti.“For me, if this deal had come along in the middle of my career, it would have been another swing and miss. Coming at the very end, after I had postponed my retirement, the loss of GE’s biggest deal seemed to loom larger,” he writes in his autobiography.He went on bitterly to criticise the lack of a “viable review process” in the Commission’s merger control procedures, and called for companies to be given “their timely day in court” before deals are blocked.It is too late to save Mr Welch’s deal. But on Wednesday, he will finally get his day in court all the same.

He also becomes a member of Goldman’s global markets institute, which looks at the role of capital markets in society.His appointment comes just one day ahead of an expected ruling by European regulators on whether they were right to block the GE/Honeywell merger.It was Mr Monti who blocked that deal, even though US antitrust regulators had already approved it.His decision marked the first time European regulators had blocked a merger approved by their US counterparts.In addition, he tried to block three other mergers: Airtours/First Choice; Schneider Electric/Legrand; and Tetra Laval/Sidel.However, all three bans were overturned by the European Court of First Instance.Dubbed “Super Mario” during his eventful five-year reign at the Commission, Mr Monti also clashed heavily with the French government over several state aid cases.Last year, he took France to the European Court of Justice for failing to demand repayment from Bull, the computer manufacturer, of a €450m ($533m) bridge loan.He also opposed the government’s proposal to save Alstom, a maker of power plants and trains, from bankruptcy, although he later backed the plan after France promised more spin-offs and private-sector involvement.Goldman Sachs has 26 international advisers, including Karel van Miert, who preceded Mr Monti as the EU antitrust commissioner, and Thomas Foley, the former US ambassador to Japan.“Mario is a highly respected policy-maker and economist,” said Peter Sutherland, chairman, Goldman Sachs International.Goldman is currently ranked as the world’s top adviser, having worked on 330 deals worth a total $724bn, according to Dealogic, the data provider.Mr Monti, the son of a banker from Varese in northern Italy, gained a degree in economics and management from Milan’s Bocconi University in 1965 and did graduate work at Yale University.He is currently president of Bocconi University in Milan and also chairs the Brussels European and Global Economic Laboratory, which provides analysis to EU institutions on macroeconomics, international finance, markets and regulation.Prior to that, Mr Monti was a professor of economics and then rector at Bocconi University and chair of the Italian Treasury ministry’s committee on the banking and financial system, which sets guidelines for Italy’s financial policies."

The index ended the day up 0.1 per cent, or 1,61 points, at 1,263.70 after having hit a new 4½-year high in intra-day trading.The Nasdaq Composite index was up a marginal 0.1 per cent, or 3.12 points, at 2,260,76 after soaring by as much as 0.9 per cent.“The market appeared to have had a case of vertigo,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. “We have had a big rally in recent weeks and it seemed that the theme of buying stocks because its the end of the year has played itself out.”Technology stocks proved to be the session’s most resilent performers, with chipmaker Altera jumping 6 per cent to $19.40 after it raised its fourth-quarter gross margin target and sales forecast. The news lifted the wider semiconductor sector, which closed up 1 per cent.Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, a bullish note from UBS sent index darling Apple Computer 3.1 per cent higher to $74.05. The investment bank raised its target price on Apple from $74 to $86, citing increased revenue growth from the group’s video iPods and iMac computers.Adobe also performed well. Shares in the software maker rose 4.9 per cent to $36.99 after closing its $3.8bn acquisition of Macromedia at the weekend.Department store operator Sears Holdings recovered its previous day’s losses, its share price rising 5.3 per cent to $122.97 after it reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.By contrast, food group ConAgra fell 2.5 per cent to $20.70 after it lowered its

323;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-11-30T21:35:15Z;Autos and banks drag Wall Street lower;;Wall Street was knocked off its feet on Wednesday after sharp losses in the auto and financial sectors dragged the indices into the red.Shares in the auto industry tumbled ahead of the sector’s November sales reports, due on Thursday. General Motors, led the fall, dropping 4.8 per cent to $21.90, followed by Ford Motor, the second largest carmaker in the US, down 4.7 per cent to $8.13. Analysts are expecting sharp sales declines for the two companies, despite heavy discounting and lower petrol prices. Both companies have been losing market share to their Asian rivals in recent years.In the wider market, news that the US gross domestic product grew at a revised 4.3 per cent annual rate in the July-to-September period, the fastest pace since the first three months of 2004, only fanned fears of inflationThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.8 per cent, or 82.29 points, at 10,805.87. The broader S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent, or 8 points, at 1,249.48. The Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,232.82.The slide followed Tuesday’s retreat, which came after a series of positive economic data fuelled concerns that the Fed would continue to raise interest rates.Banks and financials were the biggest drag on the S&P 500.The two sector fell as investors paused to lock in on recent gains.American Express led the fallers, dropping 1.4 per cent to $51.42 followed by Bank of America down 0.8 per cent at $45.89 and Fannie Mae, down 2.8 per cent at $48.05.“A lot of these stocks are in a situation where they have been saturated by buyers,” said Christopher Johnson, director quantative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research.“And at the moment, investors feel more comfortable cashing in on short term gains rather than buy and hold their stocks. The mentality of the market is that a bird on one hand is much better than two in the bush.”On the Nasdaq, Yahoo was a talking point after UBS became the second broker to downgrade the internet search engine, citing valuation concerns.UBS said the stock was near its five-year high, and the company would need to execute some important initiatives before the broker could increase estimates.But there were still buyers. Shares in Yahoo fell by as much as 2.5 per cent in early trading before rebounding to trade up 0.1 per cent at $40.23.Rival Google also fell in morning trading on concern that the stock, which has soared 40 per cent in 2 months, may be overpriced. However, the stock bounced back to close up 0.3 per cent at $404.91 after a 4.7 per cent drop on Tuesday.BlackBerry maker Research In Motion was dealt another legal setback in a key patent infringement case on Wednesday, raising pressure to settle or face a possible shutdown of its U.S. mobile e-mail service. Shares fell 5.8 per cent to $61.13.Tivo, up 3.8 per cent to $5.36, recovered somewhat after its shares slumped by nearly 10 per cent in the previous session.The energy sector heavyweight Exxon-Mobil edged up 0.4 per cent to $58.54. Chevron Texaco added 0.2 per cent to $57.50. Marathon Oil was the leading gainer in the sector, rising 1.3 per cent to $59.39.Tiffany, the jewellery retailer, also struggled, dropping 3.2 per cent to $40.79 after third quarter sales fell short of expectations.Companies whose earnings are tied to the state of the economy, such as Caterpillar and Honeywell, advanced. The former moved up 0.7 per cent to $57.51 while the latter gained 0.8 per cent to $57.51.
324;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-11-22T17:12:27Z;EU court to rule on GE-Honeywell case;;The European Commission will learn in mid-December whether it was right to block the proposed $41bn merger between US engineering groups General Electric and Honeywell in 2001.More than any other, the ruling established the Commission’s reputation as a tough regulator, but it also sparked massive controversy in the US.The European Court of First Instance, the European Union’s second-highest court, confirmed on Tuesday that its long-awaited decision on the case would be made public on December 14. The court has overturned several Commission merger prohibitions in the past, and a further defeat for the regulator would come as a blow to Brussels.The Commission argued at the time that the combination of GE’s jet engines business and Honeywell’s aircraft electronic equipment operations would have allowed the merged group to overpower competitors.Brussels has since been much more reluctant to block mergers, especially in cases where the companies involved do not have overlapping businesses.
325;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-10-19T20:40:58Z;Solid earnings spark Wall Street rally;;Wall Street bulls triumphed over the ghosts of the 1987 market crash thanks to a broad rally on Wednesday afternoon, helped by enough strong corporate earnings to offset the weaker results.The Dow received strong support from United Technologies, the helicopters-to-elevators conglomerate, which rose 3.8 per cent to $51.84 after reporting strong profit growth and raised its full-year guidance.Home Depot helped push the Dow industrials higher, closing 3 per cent up at $39.30, while McDonald’s also beefed up the average with its 4.2 per cent gain to $33.84.These gains overshadowed the dour tone earlier set by two other Dow components.Honeywell, another conglomerate, fell 5.1 per cent to $34.09 after it gave a narrower guidance that distracted investors’ attention from news the industrial conglomerate achieved 26 per cent profit growth in the last three months.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, said after the Tuesday close that revenue estimates were hampered by supply constraints and inventory build-up among its customers. Intel shares erased earlier losses amid the broader rally to close 0.2 per cent up at $23.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which had buckled under Intel’s pressure, also recovered to close virtually unchanged, with Teradyne’s 2.6 per cent advance to $14.29.News that crude and distillate inventories in the US had risen, which prompted a drop in energy prices, also provided relief.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent at 10,408.45, while the S&P 500 index advanced 1.4 per cent to 1,195.13. The Nasdaq Composite finished 1.6 per cent ahead at 2,089.44.The broad rally flew in the face of a bearish call on homebuilders’ stocks issued by Analysts at Banc of America Securities as US government data showed construction of new homes rose sharply last month.The Dow Jones US Home Construction sector index shrugged off the call and closed 4.8 per cent ahead in spite of BofA’s downgrade of the sector’s outlook to “cautious” from “positive”. The bank’s analyst team pointed to several trends that indicate “further weakness in pricing trends in the months to come”.Shares in Toll Brothers put on 5.3 per cent to $39.17, while Hovnanian Enterprises was up 4.1 per cent to $46.64. NVR, whose rating was cut to “sell” from “buy”, gained 2.4 per cent to $696.05.Among financials, JPMorgan Chase announced a 78 per cent increase in net profits and saw its shares gain 2.9 per cent to $34.75.Meanwhile, Bank of America’s net profits rose 10 per cent last quarter, thanks to mortgage and credit card revenues, sending shares up 2 per cent to $42.42.The onslaught of banking earnings helped push the BKX sector index up 2 per cent by the close.Internet stocks were in focus after Yahoo, the largest internet portal operator, announced tepid profit growth and rising sales, sending shares up 6.6 per cent to $35.68 on the news. Ebay, which was due to report earnings after the close, gained 3.9 per cent to $42.01.
326;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-10-19T15:20:26Z;Honeywell profits beat expectation;;Honeywell, the defence and aerospace group, raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after third-quarter earnings beat expectations, driven by strong sales of commercial aircraft components.“This was another strong quarter for Honeywell, highlighted by 5 per cent organic growth and a full point of margin expansion,” said Dave Cote, Honeywell’s chairman and chief executive. “We continued to make significant progress in positioning the business for growth.”Honeywell, the world’s leading maker of cockpit instruments, has benefitted this year from a long-awaited recovery in market for commercial jets, which has fuelled demand for components and replacement parts. Sales at Honeywell’s aerospace division rose 6 per cent, with commercial aircraft sales up 9 per cent.Net income rose 26 per cent to $470m, or 55 cents per share. Revenues came in slightly lower than expected at $6.9bn, however, as sales at the group’s transportation unit suffered from sagging demand for turbo engines in Europe.The third-quarter performance led Honeywell to raise its guidance for the full year. Honeywell now expects earnings of $2.11-$2.13 this year, excluding tax charges arising from the repatriation of foreign income. Most analysts had been expecting 2005 earnings of $2.11 a share. The company said it expected sales to rise 8 per cent to $27.6bn, with free cash flow of $1.7 - $1.8bn.Honeywell indicated that it was beginning to feel pressure from higher energy costs, which led to lower margins at the group’s transportation group. Productivity gains helped offset cost pressures elsewhere.The company said Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita had a minimal impact on its operations. “We sustained minimal damange to assets, but we did shut down facilities,” said David Anderson, chief financial officer. The company lost about $10m as a result of the storm, mostly from lost work time due to supply chain disruptions.Honeywell shares dipped more than 2 per cent in early trading in New York to $35.17.
327;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-10-03T13:58:06Z;RH Donnelley to buy Dex Media for $4.2bn;;RH Donnelley is set to become the third largest US telephone directory company after sealing the $4.2bn acquisition of Dex Media, a rival, amid a flurry of mid-sized transactions announced on Monday in the US.Donnelley’s move, which reflects a need to compete more effectively against the growing power of internet search engines such as Google, accounted for only a fraction of the volume of deals in the US, which exceeded $10bn on Monday.Also announced was a $2.2bn cash acquisition by Chesapeake Energy, which is buying Columbia Resources, a natural gas producer with assets in the Appalachian Basin, from Metalmark, the former private equity unit of Morgan Stanley.In addition, Reliant Energy’s sold three New York-based power plants to private equity groups Madison Dearborn and US Power Generation for $975m. This came on the heels of Sunday’s landmark deal in the highly fragmented US merchant power industry, where NRG Energy of New Jersey agreed to pay $5.8bn in cash and stock for Texas Genco.Private equity firms Texas Pacific Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group and Hellman Friedman bought Texas Genco last summer for $3.7bn producing a return of more than five times in a year. Increased interest in the global refining industry encouraged Honeywell, a US industrial conglomerate, to buy out its joint venture partner Dow Chemical in an $825m deal to take full control of UOP, which provides catalysts and technology to refineries.In real estate, Monday’s $2bn union of Brandywine Realty Trust and Prentiss Properties Trust will form one of the largest office property companies in the US with a portfolio of 49m sq ft.Donnelley’s acquisition of Dex, paid for in a mix of cash and stock, provides the latest evidence that the company is counting on size and geographic expansion to tackle increasing competition from online search groups. “Scale is going to be more important in our business,“ said David Swanson, Donnelley chief executive, in an interview with the FT. In 2003, it acquired Sprint’s directories business for $2.2bn and last year it bought SBC’s yellow page portfolios in Illinois and Indiana for $1.4bn.After the Dex acquisition closes, Donnelley will operate in 28 states, generating annual revenues of $2.7bn.Investors in Dex including its private equity backers Carlyle and Welsh Carson will receive the equivalent of $27.58 a share, in a mix of cash and stock that values the company below its closing share price on Friday. However, this price represents the highest valuation for an incumbent yellow pages company, at 10.4 times estimated 2005 earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation.
328;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-10-02T15:59:31Z;Brussels braces for a US lobbying invasion;;"Gerald Cassidy has spent 30 years turning Cassidy & Associates into one of the most powerful lobbying firms in Washington. Now, he says, he is ready to bring to Brussels – and ultimately more European cities – the same resolve that has made his firm such an influence in the nation’s capital.Sitting in his office on 13th Street in north-west Washington, just two blocks from the White House, Mr Cassidy explains why he has made the decision to enter the European market. He offers up a historical perspective on what lobbying means in America and explains his belief that it is becoming, for the first time, relevant in Europe.“Our system starts from a different point from Europe. The first amendment says that Congress can do nothing to interfere with – to ­prevent – citizens from participating in government. And they could have advocates to do that.“Madison said in the Federalist Papers that DC is the place to do that, where the nation’s conflicts will be resolved,” he says. “Europe has had for a very long time a system where power elites resolve problems. In this country, we call it an ‘old boy’s network’. Our system is open to much wider participation; it comes out of a political system of more direct action.”But Mr Cassidy believes “the old boy’s network” is about to change, and that Europeans – and European companies – are “learning to be more influential”.“They are understanding it is an acceptable thing to do,” he says.There is, of course, perhaps a more practical reason – beyond the lessons of America’s founding fathers for Mr Cassidy’s move into the Belgian capital.Washington is traditionally where the regulation of US companies comes head-to-head with corporate lobbyists who, in many cases, try to prevent it from happening. But there is now a growing realisation in many quarters that Brussels, not Washington, is shaping the global regulatory standards companies will have to
abide by.“In a lot of areas, Europe has got ahead of the US . . . [in] agriculture, where they took the lead on regulating the use of bio-
engineered foods, and on food inspection. . . Their stance on antitrust seems to be setting a new standard, which is based more on what is the potential for concentration of economic activity rather than what is the present situation,” says Mr Cassidy.His views on the growing powers of the European Union were, in many ways, shaped by the soft-spoken Mario Monti who, on July 3, 2001, announced his decision to block the merger between General Electric and Honeywell, a combination of two US companies that would have created a global powerhouse, and a union that had the backing of US regulators.The companies had committed a grave error in initially paying little attention to the European Commission, despite the body’s formal powers in the area of merger control and antitrust. The Commission’s action proved that it was more than happy to wield those powers – even in the face of two multinational giants.Mr Cassidy also cites the seemingly never-ending competition-related rows Microsoft faces, not in the US, but in Brussels, which have dogged the company for years. In the wake of the GE/Honeywell ruling, few US groups now make the mistake of ignoring the EU’s top competition regulator.More and more US companies Many have also since discovered that Brussels is the source of an increasingly large volume of legislation, ranging from environmental and labour standards to labelling requirements and new rules for the financial services industry.America’s industrial groups have, for example, joined European counterparts in calling for a less stringent version of a sweeping new regulation for the chemicals sector, which is currently being debated by the European parliament and the Union’s 25 member states. US technology companies have been active in lobbying the EU institutions on a planned software patents law, which failed earlier this year after much controversy.The dramatic increase in US lobbying activity in recent years means that companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Procter & Gamble, General Electric and General Motors have already opened offices in Brussels to lobby the Commission, the European parliament and the Council of Ministers – the three institutions that call the shots in the EU capital. Their desire to influence the political and regulatory process in Brussels has also swelled the ranks of the professional lobbyists in the city, now estimated to stand at 13,000.One of them is Tom Brookes, a partner at consultancy GPlus Europe, who advises both Microsoft and Wal-Mart on EU strategy. He says: “I think Brussels continues to increase in importance for US companies, because it is one of the two main hubs of global policymaking. A great number of policies that define how you do business in the world are defined in those two centres and if you’re operating in a global market you have to treat those two centres with pretty much equal weight.”Mr Brookes points out that the Commission not only acts as the Union’s main competition and trade regulator but that Brussels is also the starting point for about 80 per cent of the legislation that affects a market with more than 450m consumers. It is not least to discuss new EU rules on issues such as the services industry and food labelling that Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, comes to Brussels about once a year for meetings with key commissioners. The influx of American and US-style lobbyists in Brussels may underscore Mr Cassidy’s conclusion about the power of the EU – but the rapid development of the lobbying industry also raises another question.By opening an office in Brussels four years after the GE/Honeywell decision, is Mr Cassidy, one of the most effective lobbyists in Washington, arriving too late?He believes not – mainly, he says, because American-style lobbying is still only in its infancy in Brussels.“I think what they call lobbying [now] we call public affairs – monitoring information campaigns, and conversations and meetings with regulators. I think that what you are seeing of direct lobbying is really at the beginning. Lobbying is direct advocacy with people that are making political decisions, whether they are regulators or legislators, and public affairs is trying to influence those people through the techniques of public affairs,” he says.Mr Cassidy’s assertions about ineffective lobbying in Brussels to date were underscored recently by Sir David Arculus, deputy president of the CBI, in an interview with the Financial Times. Sir David contended that business groups have been too reactive in their ap-proach to lobbying in Brussels by not creating the right business alliances during the early stages of the development of a proposal.“While British business is rather good at lobbying Whitehall, European business as a whole is quite weak at getting together and joining forces to put [across] its point of view,” he said.Andreas Geiger, former head of Ernst & Young’s European law centre, was hired by Mr Cassidy to set up the Brussels office.
He as president and CEO of Cassidy & Associates Europe, agrees that European companies have not yet mastered the lobbying techniques Americans deploy in Washington.These include the practice of “legal lobbying”, in which a lobbyist will influence the wording of a directive in order to spare their client future problems. Mr Geiger says that European companies have depended too much on industry associations comprised of groups with sometimes diverging goals to try to assert
influence.“The problem that arises in these associations, for example in the automotive industry, is that they would talk about car emissions, and all three companies,
for example, would have ­different attitudes toward it,” he says.While the vast and long-established Brussels lobby is perhaps more sophisticated than Mr Cassidy suggests, it may yet have something to learn from the techniques and tricks of an old master, developed over decades.LOBBYISTS DIVIDE ON TRANSATLANTIC LINESAndreas Geiger, chief executive of Cassidy Associates Europe, believes there are differences between EU and US lobbying styles. He says:■ EU lobbyists tend to summarise proposals and directives for clients as they are being drawn up, rather than make legal arguments to legislators or regulators about problems with proposed legislation■ US-style lobbying tends to focus on the legal reasons why language in a directive is problematic or potentially illegal, while EU lobbyists tend to use public campaigns to draw attention to a directive’s consequences■ Most of the law firms that carry out lobbying work in Brussels spend time on corporate work such as mergers and acquisitions and cartel issues, rather than direct lobbying work"
329;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-09-29T19:35:55Z;High hopes for Honeywell despite gloom over job cut;;"Honeywell, one of the largest US aerospace suppliers, likes to show off its collision-avoidance electronics by flying visitors out into the Arizona desert and hurtling directly towards the canyon walls before pulling up at the last minute. The stunt is even more alarming to those on the ground, who have been known to ring air traffic control to question the sanity of those in the cockpit.But the bigger local worry was caused by Honeywell's recent decision to cut 2,000 jobs across its aerospace division despite record profits and a soaring demand from customers. Headquartered in Phoenix, the division is one of the few big employers in a city where it is hard to work out where all the new jobs will come from to satisfy such a fast-growing population.Like much of corporate America, Honeywell mushroomed in size through acquisitions in the 1990s, and after concentrating on improving manufacturing productivity, is now getting around to taking out unnecessary white collar jobs too.Such cutbacks should be seen as a sign of strength not weakness, argues Rob Gillette, the company's head of aerospace, who says it is the only way it can continue competing against low-cost rivals abroad: “The time to do this is when things are good”.Fortunately for a city attracting some 3,000 new residents a week, there are still plenty of alternatives among smaller firms in the service sector. Like much of the sunbelt, 95 per cent of all companies in Phoenix have less than 100 employees.Yet Honeywell's experience epitomises a paradox at the heart of the US economy. From below, corporate America looks a lot less healthy than it does from above.In the cockpit, chief executives boast of 10 straight quarters of strong profits growth, accounting for a record share of national income. On the ground, ordinary Americans hear only of retrenchment, redundancies and crisis.In part, this reflects a geographic disconnect. Much of the gloomiest news still comes from the rustbelt, where the crises of Detroit's carmakers overshadows upbeat announcements such as Toyota's plans to build a new factory in San Antonio, Texas.The serial bankruptcies of Midwest-based airlines such as United and NorthWest contrasts with low-cost rivals such as Southwest or JetBlue, who make most of their money flying to sunbelt destinations.This glass-half-empty view gained momentum during 2004's bitter presidential election campaign which concentrated attention on swing states where manufacturing job losses have been the biggest problemSince 1998, states like Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Pennsylvania have each lost more than 200,000 jobs in manufacturing. In contrast, only Nevada has added any substantial manufacturing jobs, but manufacturing is a small part of the whole economy, especially outside the north-east.Corporate America's resilience is also poorly understood because the economic mood music has been so gloomy. Rising petrol costs are just the latest in a series of challenges piling up for the pessimists to worry about. Over the last 18 months, the US has lurched from fears over outsourcing and job growth to worries about economic soft patches, rising interest rates, credit bubbles and hurricanes.One business magazine even warned this summer that the US was becoming a “97lb economic weakling” compared with China.Yet throughout this blizzard of negative headlines, corporate America has proved remarkably profitable underpinning solid, if not spectacular, economic growth. Away from troubled industries like carmaking and airlines, relatively debt-free companies look better placed to weather economic storms than they often have been in the past.For many in the business world, the picture of a fragile US economy painted in recent months can be difficult to recognise. John Castellani, president of the US Business Roundtable, says he has been “astounded by the disconnect”.Siemens, the largest foreign employer in the US, points to North America, not China, as its most important market.“The US is the sweet spot for us right now,” says John Bergen, US corporate affairs director of the German group. “No one is saying manufacturing is easy at US labour rates but it is certainly a lot easier than it is in Europe.”The contrast with Europe or Japan is particularly noticeable among companies trying to adapt to changes in technology. While Sony agonises over its cutbacks in Japan, Kodak is painfully making the move to new digital technology with 26,000 job losses in film production.Jeff Joerres, chief executive of Manpower which places 2m temporary staff with companies around the world, says the big difference in US productivity is its willingness to adapt and reinvent.“The assumption that businesses are in business to create employment has changed; they are in business to retain as much employment as possible,” he says. “There is an understanding in the US that this is a game of survival.”This is the last in a three-part series on US economic resilience."

331;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-08-29T20:02:40Z;Equitas set to pay more US asbestos settlements;;Equitas, the unlisted reinsurance company created to save the Lloyd’s insurance market from collapsing under the weight of asbestos-related claims, will announce on Tuesday that it has agreed settlements with a further six significant policyholders at a total cost of $300m (£167m).Included in the agreements are settlements with Kaiser Aluminium, a producer of fabricated aluminium products, Crane Company, an engineering group, and Congoleum, which makes resilient sheet and tile floor coverings, as well as three companies whose identities have not been disclosed.Glenn Brace, Equitas’s claims director, said the agreements reflected further progress on closing the largest company liabilities that remained after a $415m settlement with Babcock & Wilcox, a US engineering company, in March. This was the largest remaining single exposure to a company faced by Equitas.“This [Tuesday’s agreements] is further progress, but it is not a conclusion of our efforts to negotiate these settlements,” said Mr Brace. “I hope that we will be able to close some additional ones in the remainder of this year.”He added: “We continue to seek comprehensive settlements and are currently in negotiations with other major policyholders.”Other large settlements with companies to date include a $472m agreement with Honeywell in April 2003, a $575m settlement with Halliburton in January 2004, and a $200m deal with four policyholders including Dana Corporation, the US car parts group, in January this year.In total, since April 2001, Equitas has resolved 35 large asbestos settlements with companies involving the payment of more than $2.9bn.Equitas said the settlements with Kaiser Aluminium and Congoleum were subject to conditions relating to the pending bankruptcies of these companies.Mr Brace said the settlements and the bankruptcies had to be approved by the courts before the payments, which have been placed in trust or escrow, transfer to the companies. If these conditions were not satisfied, the settlement amounts, would be repaid to Equitas, it said.The latest settlements come as US lawmakers work on a US asbestos compensation fund. When Equitas announced its 2004 results in June, it said the situation surrounding the proposed US legislation to set up the compensation fund remained uncertain.In April, Equitas won a significant concession from senior US lawmakers about its treatment in the bill. But it is not certain if the bill in its current form will be passed.The US asbestos compensation fund is expected to come back onto the agenda when Congress returns next month.

Rick was there to sort out, or to put it on the straight and narrow so it could be sold off. But he has made a half way house of it, and it is still hamstrung by debt. Ulf is an operations man, he is here to run it and will take out costs.”Those who have met the cool, methodical Mr Henriksson agree that he is as different from Mr Haythornthwaite as is possible. “He’s very hands on, rather than sitting in the office chatting to investment bankers he has been out on the road shouting at people,” said one analyst.But this emphasis on doing the rounds many believe has given him a better grasp of the business than previous chief executives of the diverse engineering group.Before he was lured to a Invensys, Mr Henriksson over saw the hydraulics division at Eaton Corp, and held several senior positions at Honeywell including president of automated control systems.Some measure of Mr Henriksson’s much praised operational abilities could on Thursday be judged by what he has managed to achieve with APV, the process equipment division, where he has reviewed operations and replaced the senior management.His experience in control systems are also expected to prove valuable for the controls division that has suffered from product recalls and weakening performance.

The selection of Clark - a Merck insider whose background is in manufacturing - does not seem to be about a grand strategic turnround.""People within Merck would get insight into what is about to happen if they get a copy of Bossidy's book,"" advises Buster Houchins of the executive search firm Christian & Timbers.Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of Honeywell, is essentially acting as Merck's chairman.

""Clark may be strong on strategy, but if you look at the experience he's had, he was chosen for the role because he understands execution.""Bidding upSotheby's might not be making as much hay at its big art auction sale this year as it did last year, but Bill Ruprecht, the head of the house, can be comforted by knowing he at least has a nice bonus in the bag for 2004.Ruprecht, who took the top job in the midst of the price-fixing scandal five years ago, tripled his bonus to $1.25m last year, up from a measly $375,000 in 2003. In 2002, however, he got $4m - partly because the troubled auction house had to promise big bonuses to anyone who stayed on in the face of staff poaching attempts by Sotheby's rivals.Last May saw Sotheby's eclipse its rivals, partly thanks to it putting up the most expensive painting ever sold at auction, Picasso's ""Head of a Boy"", which went under the hammer for $104m.However, the auctioneer's big Impressionist and Modern sales have so far been something of a damp squib this year, with a third of the works failing to sell at the first round on Tuesday night.Horse centsThe Kentucky Derby has always been an event associated with Southern gentility, but this Saturday the tony equestrian set will really be able to take it easy.Thanks to IBM, those well-heeled enough to sit in the reserved suites at Churchill Downs will never have to leave their seats.

334;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2005-03-23T21:34:44Z;Oil slide offsets inflation fears on Wall St;;A weak showing by heavy manufacturers dragged down blue-chips on Wednesday, quashing hopes of a tentative rally. But the broader market edged higher as Wall Street bucked inflation fears and cheered the falling price of oil.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 10,456.02. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both closed marginally higher at 1,172.51 and 1,190.22, respectively.Official data showed that prices for consumer goods rose by more than expected in February, adding to inflation concerns outlined by the US Federal Reserve as it raised interest rates by a quarter point on Tuesday.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies, said the negative inflation data were countered by a sharp fall in crude prices, which fell by more than $2 after a report said crude inventories were at their highest levels in almost three years.The resulting tug-of-war held the indices locked in a tight range, as the focus turned away from economics and toward the Easter weekend.Heavy industry stalwarts took a beating as investors flocked to tech stocks in search of upward momentum. Honeywell, the aerospace group, fell 2.5 per cent to $37.28. Alcoa, the world’s biggest aluminium producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $30.39. Energy groups also fell. Noble Energy, the oil and gas explorer, fell 2.8 per cent to $66.07. XTO Energy, a rival, fell 4.8 per cent to $31.43.Carmakers continued to slide in the wake of General Motors’ profit warning last week. GM fell 3 per cent to $28.66 after it confirmed it was in talks to sell a stake in the commercial mortgage arm of its profitable GMAC finance division. Ford, GM’s biggest US rival, fell 1.6 per cent to $10.99.Semiconductors were among the day’s best performers. Volatile tech stocks are a frequent target of momentum-driven trades when markets edge higher.Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, rose 1.6 per cent to $23.39. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose rose 1.2 per cent to 414.86. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s chief competitor, rose 1.8 per cent to $15.65.Oracle rose 0.1 per cent to $12.51 after it reported a drop in quarterly profit, due in part to charges arising from its recent acquisition of PeopleSoft, a business software rival.Among pharmaceuticals stocks, Bristol Myers Squibb rose 2.5 per cent to $25.32 after it said it would buy back up to $2.5bn in debt. Pfizer said it would close a factory in Michigan, sending shares up 2.4 per cent to $26.04.The battle between Qwest and Verizon for control of rival telecommunications group MCI continued. MCI rose 1.3 per cent to $23.27 as the company’s board met to discuss Qwest’s sweetened bid for the company. Qwest rose 0.8 per cent and Verizon rose 1.3 per cent.

336;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2004-12-16T13:39:53Z;Lex: Kidde;;In poker, success can be as embarrassing as failure. When the cards are finally on the table, the gulf between posture and reality is revealed. Kidde, the UK fire protection specialist, must have slightly red cheeks. Having rejected an offer of 160p from United Technologies Corporation in October as “materially undervaluing” the company, on Thursday it recommended one only 4 per cent higher.For this, Kidde took a genuine risk. At times since October its shares have traded well below 160p, reflecting the danger that the US conglomerate might walk away. Kidde's tough tactics mirrored UTC's, which bought a 2.6 per stake in Kidde, hoping to woo it with an uninvited “bear hug”.Yet viewed in dollars, UTC is paying significantly more than it hoped. In dollar terms, its final bid is 28 per cent higher than its first approach in mid-summer, and 12 per cent above October's price. Since half of Kidde's profits are generated in dollars, it is equally fair to view the increase in the bid in dollar or sterling terms.Secondly, since October, two potential buyers opted for other deals. General Electric bought Edwards, the fire protection business of SPX. Honeywell bid for Novar, the UK company with a building safety division.Given these two factors the offer looks good, at 18 times forecast 2004 clean earnings and 2.4 times the price at which Kidde was demerged from Williams in 2000. Kidde has taken things to the wire. But to be a good negotiator you have to be prepared to fail.
337;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2020-04-24T01:59:33+0000;Wall Street climbs on acquisition news;;"Wall Street forged ahead on Monday as investors pounced on stronger-than-expected US retail sales figures and a flurry of merger and acquisition activity reinforced speculation of further deals.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.9 per cent at 10,640.39, while the S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,198.74.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shot up 1 per cent to 2,148.31, buoyed by news that PeopleSoft had agreed to a multi-billion dollar takeover by Oracle, its business software rival.Bullish investors welcomed signs of renewed vigour in the stock markets following last week's widely expected retreat, which came in the face of uncertainties about world oil supply and a slow, but steady, stream of economic data that presented a mixed picture of the state of the US economy.PeopleSoft shares soared more than 10.3 per cent to $26.42 as Oracle's sweetened $26.50 per share offer brought to an end a bitter 18-month fight for control of the business software group.Oracle shares jumped 10.2 per cent to $14.63 as the company added to investor relief at the end of the takeover battle by reporting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Siebel Systems, a business software rival, slipped 0.2 per cent to $9.97, while US-listed shares of SAP, the German business software group, rose 3.2 per cent to $45.05.PeopleSoft's $10.3bn price tag makes the acquisition one of several multi-billion dollar deals on Wall Street this month. It follows Johnson & Johnson's planned $24bn acquisition of Guidant, the cardiac stent maker, and the pending $35bn merger between Sprint and Nextel, the telecommunications groups. Talks are continuing on both deals, which were announced last week.Merger mania has taken hold across a wide range of sectors in recent days as companies mull whether to capitalise on this year's strong run on Wall Street to make acquisitions.John O'Donoghue, managing director of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that although he was not expecting another big deal before the year-end the recent M&A activity was likely to continue into 2005.""Balance sheets in the US are in probably as good a shape cash-wise as they've been in many years,"" he said, adding that the stock market's strong performance had left many companies in a good position to use their shares as currency in M&A transactions.Honeywell, the diversified manufacturer, rose 3 per cent to $36.35 after its $798m offer for Novar, the UK electrical equipment group, was approved by the company's board. Shares in Toys R Us rose 2.9 per cent to $20.49 after the Financial Times reported that Apollo and Permira, the private equity groups, had teamed up to bid for the US toy group's retail operations.Conexant, the semiconductor company, rose 4.5 per cent to $1.87 in spite of warning that sagging demand and lower market prices would lead to a greater-than-expected first-quarter loss. One trader said that investors were weighing Monday's news against the potential for strong gains at the first sign of a turnround in the chip sector, which some analysts have said could happen early next year.Retailers ended mixed following an early rally sparked by official US data showing that retail sales grew by a stronger-than-expected 0.1 per cent in November. The report by the US Commerce Department also said that October retail sales had been higher than first estimated.Wal-Mart, the retail giant, rose 0.5 per cent to $52.95, but shares in rival Target were 0.4 per cent lower at $51.51. Home Depot, the home improvement group, was up 0.2 per cent at $42.73.Analysts had been disappointed by early reports indicating lacklustre retail sales in November, which included ""Black Friday"" - the day after Thanksgiving - traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said the new data were a hopeful sign that retailers finally had the wind at their backs. ""Barring a major downward revision, we are set for a pretty robust holiday season.""Carmakers fell after motor vehicle and parts sales slipped 1.3 per cent in November, according to the government figures. General Motors slid 0.3 per cent to $38.80, while Ford dropped 0.1 per cent to $14.23."
338;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2004-12-13T20:38:05Z;Lombard: More than a common takeover bid;;Deutsche Börse returns for the LSEThe London Stock Exchange is now firmly in play, thanks to Deutsche Börse's bid proposal, but the course of this takeover tussle should be much more complex than most and raise basic issues about the structure of Europe's equity markets.Deutsche Börse's 530p is a very strong sighting shot, but these are early days and the exchange is rightly scorning the terms. It is in shareholders' interests that it tries to get an auction going. Euronext, the other obvious marriage partner, will want to get involved, though its pockets may not be as deep as the much larger German bourse.However, the battle for the LSE's hand is not purely about price - though it is now hard to see it retaining its independence. The implications of any deal for the shape of markets are also important. Much has changed since the LSE's then member-owners were able to scupper the proposed 2000 London-Frankfurt iX merger because they did not like its implications. Members now account for only 25 per cent of the equity of the floated LSE. But the exchange still has a symbiotic relationship with its users, making it difficult for Deutsche Börse to go hostile and easy for the LSE to raise competition and regulatory concerns.Deutsche Börse has clearly learned from the collapse of iX, amid regulatory controversy and the proposed relocation of the high-growth market to Frankfurt. It says its new proposal will preserve existing market structures and regulation.And customers ought to benefit from a merger between two of Europe's big three cash equity exchanges if the resulting synergy savings are shared - as Deutsche Börse yesterday indicated they would be - and there is tough competition with the third exchange.But banks are concerned about the total cost of securities transactions, and that includes clearing and settlement, where Deutsche Börse espouses a vertical silo model - with trading, clearing and settlement all under one ownership - as opposed to the horizontal system favoured by London and Paris, where clearing and settlement are separate and more utility-like.Big investment banks, whose goal is eventually to be able to clear and net their positions across exchanges, dislike the silo structure, which raises anti-competitive issues. They and the LSE could create trouble for Deutsche Börse, unless it offers substantial concessions here in terms of transparency, governance or openness.Its assurance on Monday that it will honour existing agreements between the LSE and the UK clearing and settlement houses does not seem a huge plus, given the limited life of these contracts. We must hope its sensitivity to the issue means it has more concessions up its sleeve.Yes, yes, NovarA catalyst, correctly defined, is a substance that promotes or accelerates a chemical reaction in others, but is not itself changed in the process. That seems likely to prove a pretty good description of cash-shell Melrose's role in the eventual takeover of conglomerate Novar.Novar may, as it says, have been considering its strategic options before Melrose came on the scene last month with a hostile offer. But that event undoubtedly acted as a catalyst, promoting accelerated chemical activity in the brains of Novar's board members, leading to yesterday's cash white knight offer from Honeywell.The US company wants Novar's fire detection and environmental controls business, which will give a strategic boost to its European operations. It plans to sell Novar's other two businesses and reckons it can get rather more than many observers would have expected.Rival offers from trade buyers cannot be completely ruled out, but this looks very like a done deal. Honeywell has irrevocable acceptances from Active Value, Novar's largest shareholder, which can only be broken if an uncontested rival bid comes in at a 10 per cent premium to Honeywell.With its offer largely in paper, Melrose is unlikely to be able to put up anything nearly as compelling. And since it was not able to buy a stake in Novar ahead of its bid, it will not even walk away with the consolation prize of investment profits. Like a true catalyst, it will be essentially unchanged, except for the raised profile the bid has given it, and the costs incurred in making it.Melrose did well in spotting the potential value in Novar. The trouble for it - and indeed for any acquisitive cash shell - is that in these circumstances, shareholders will almost invariably prefer cash now from a sale to the uncertainty of a long-term shareholding in a new vehicle. And this tendency can only be accentuated by the increasing role played in bids by hedge fund arbitrageurs. Trade buyers can also bid up on the strength of synergies.So while the idea behind Melrose is superficially appealing - using a takeover to put in highly incentivised management, backed by institutions, at underperforming companies - actually executing deals of any size could prove rather tricky.martin.dickson@ft.com
339;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2004-12-12T19:59:59Z;GE splashes out on small takeovers;;General Electric has spent more on acquisitions since it promised an end to big deals than it did on both last year's blockbuster bids. After a flurry of smaller takeovers in recent days, it has announced deals worth $16.5bn in the past year, according to FT estimates.When added to deals that were sealed in 2004, the value of acquisitions that have been paid for or committed to this year rises to $42bn a figure matched only by the US conglomerate's unsuccessful bid for Honeywell in 2001.The $42bn includes the big bids announced in October 2003 for Amersham and Vivendi Universal that prompted Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and chief executive, to reassure investors that no more “major portfolio moves” were envisaged.Though consistent with his prediction that “small puts and takes around the edges” would still occur, the fact that GE has since spent as much again on such “smaller” deals suggests it continues to rely on acquisitions.In the past three weeks alone, it has committed $8.3bn to acquisitions, bringing announced cash deals for 2004 almost to the level of its busiest years.GE says the headline totals overstate the underlying costs because they include acquisitions of consumer and commercial finance companies where more efficient capital structures are put in place. Such deals, including last week's $4.4bn acquisition of a truck-leasing business from Citigroup, provide assets against which GE can borrow heavily in subsequent refinancing, so off-setting its initial cash outlay.“These totals are not figures that the equity investor would recognise,” said David Frail, director of financial communications. “They vastly overstate what we've done this year.”However, the methodology used to estimate the totals is often used to measure financial services deals.And the $4.4bn asset price includes 600 employees and 196,000 trucks, which now sit on GE's balance sheet. Citigroup used the figure to describe the sale for inclusion in merger and acquisition league tables.Some analysts have queried the value of last week's acquisition of Ionics, a water treatment company, and of other recent deals such as that for Edwards Technology Systems.The takeover of Ionics for $1.1bn plus $200m of debt, was at a 48 per cent premium to its prior share price and is worth nearly three times annual sales.However, most analysts say the acquisitions complement existing GE businesses in terms of costs, making them good value.Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan said: “The [Ionics] price looks rich at first blush, though significant cost synergies make the valuation more reasonable.”GE's underlying earnings per share have been flat this year, though the current quarter is expected to prove stronger. Much depends on whether GE can continue to squeeze growth and synergies from its new additions.“We don't buy growth, we grow what we buy,” said Mr Frail.

Such deals, including last week's $4.4bn acquisition of a truck leasing business from Citigroup, provide assets which GE can borrow heavily against in subsequent refinancing, thereby offsetting its initial cash outlay.“These totals are not figures that the equity investor would recognise,” said David Frail, director of financial communications. “They vastly overstate what we've done this year.”However, it is not uncommon to use such methodology to measure financial services deals, especially since the $4.4bn asset price includes 600 employees and 196,000 trucks which now sit on GE's balance sheet. Citigroup used the $4.4bn figure to describe the sale for the purposes of merger and acquisition league tables.The scale of recent spending is also focusing fresh attention on the value of GE's industrial deals.Last week's acquisition of Iconics, a water treatment company, for $1.1bn plus $200m of debt, was at a 48 per cent premium to its prior share price and is worth nearly three times annual sales.Some analysts have queried this, as well as the price of other recent deals such as Edwards Technology Systems, although most conclude that the strategic fit with existing GE businesses makes them worthwhile. Stephen Tusa of JP Morgan said: “The [Iconics] price looks rich at first blush, though significant cost synergies make the valuation more reasonable.”Jeffrey Sprague at Citigroup added: “While Ionics and other deals such as [Edwards Technology Systems] are technically dilutive to returns in isolation they so far fall within the framework we envision for GE's allocation of capital.”GE's underlying earnings per share have been flat this year, though the current quarter is expected to prove stronger. So, much depends on whether GE can continue its strong track record for squeezing extra organic growth and synergies from its new additions.“We don't buy growth, we grow what we buy,” said Mr Frail.
341;HON;Honeywell International Inc;2004-11-03T18:08:05Z;Book review: The grown-up guide to doing business;;"CONFRONTING REALITY
Doing what matters to get things right
By Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan
Crown Business Publishing $27.50 / £20Larry Bossidy is a grown-up. He held a number of senior posts at GE, before moving on to become chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal in 1991. After its merger with Honeywell in 1999, he became chairman of the combined group. He first attempted to retire in 2000 but came back a year later to help find a new CEO and steady the company after its long on-off dalliance with GE - a deal eventually scuppered by European Union competition laws.In a joint effort with the equally grown-up academic and consultant Ram Charan, Bossidy had his first business book success two years ago with Execution: the discipline of getting things done. Faulty execution, the authors argued, explained the gap between aspirations and results. The stark message of the book was reflected in its bold red and black cover, with ""execution"" displayed in prominent capitals. At first sight it was not clear if the title belonged in the management section of the bookshop, or the horror department.But in their writing Bossidy and Charan deal unflinchingly with reality, not fiction. Their follow-up book is inspired by the belief that too many businesses languish in unreality, deluded by wishful thinking, putting off painful measures until it is too late. This new book issues a sustained and powerful challenge to business leaders: get real, or else.Because he is a grown-up, Bossidy surely would have been sceptical of any consultant wandering into his office in the past declaring: ""It's time to radically change the way you think about your business."" But this, in fact, is the first sentence of the book. The authors justify this with a brisk summary of the changed market conditions of the early 21st century, which call, they say, for fundamentally new approaches.First, the internet and new technology have created a global real-time network in information on prices and products. Second, a global credit explosion has created over-investment, at the same time that many industries wrestle with overcapacity. The combination of these two trends produces a third- a global buyer's market, which represents ""an unprecedented shift of power from the owners and managers of capital to consumers and intermediaries, including especially giant retailers such as Wal-Mart"".In these circumstances bosses have to ask themselves questions about where their business is heading. Is the ""how"" of making money in my industry changing? Who is winning in my sector, who is not, and why? How specifically are the winners making money? If I am winning at the moment, what do I need to do to stay on top? If I am not, what changes do I need to make?This hardly sounds revolutionary, but the book is persuasive when it argues that very few business leaders come up with good answers to these questions. Their challenge to ""confront reality"" may sound simple. That does not mean it is easy.The authors identify ""six habits of highly unrealistic leaders"", which may sound familiar. Unrealistic leaders receive only filtered information. They have selective hearing. They create a climate of fear. They indulge in wishful thinking. They over-invest emotionally in misguided courses of action. And they have unrealistic expectations of the capital markets.The authors suggest that a ""back to basics"" approach may be necessary. Your business model must be looked at, and recast, to ensure survival. Three elements come together to form a genuine business model: your business environment, your financial targets and your internal activities (strategy, operations, people, processes and structure).""The business model is dynamic, not static,"" the authors say. ""You'll almost certainly need several iterations - perhaps many - to get it right initially. After that you will need to test it regularly, keeping it up to date as you perceive external changes on the horizon and changes in your internal capabilities.""The trick is to keep everything anchored in reality, they add, and to be ready to change. Or as Joe Tucci, CEO of technology company EMC is quoted here as saying: ""Companies that are afraid to disrupt themselves constantly end up being disrupted.""Instead of thinking only in terms of a supply chain, the authors say, what about the demand chain (or ""customer chain"")? Do you really understand your customers and the way demand is changing? Winning businesses do not hide from this reality either. Examples of ultra-realistic companies cited in the book include International Business Machines, Cisco, Home Depot and Thomson. They do not mindlessly pursue short-term ""shareholder value"". They seek instead to build a robust position in their markets.Of course, making big, painful changes is not easy, as the authors concede. If headcount is too high, if you are manufacturing in the wrong high-cost location, if a whole product range is facing obsolescence, unpleasant action will be necessary. But it really is necessary, Bossidy and Charan emphasise. Change has to be introduced by leaders who understand how difficult (but how important) that change is.""Humankind cannot bear very much reality,"" T. S . Eliot famously said. The duty of business leaders, this book reveals, is to confront reality at every turn - however daunting it might be - and relate that reality to the rest of the organisation. Businesses need to get real, before competitors inflict an even more unpleasant reality on them."

Total sales were up 11 per cent at $6.4bn in the period. Earnings per share were 43 cents, against 40 cents last time.Profit growth was moderated by higher raw materials costs in the non-core speciality materials businesses, the company said.During the period, Honeywell incurred charges of $64m due to environmental and other litigation, partly offset by $32m in gains from legal settlements and divested operations. Restructuring charges for the period amounted to $37m.

If the strategic thinking on M&A deals that generates high fees is being done within companies, they will only turn to banks for lower fee-paying execution work, the argument goes.However, large companies such as General Electric with well-staffed in-house corporate development teams have never shied away from making extensive use of investment bankers for M&A as well.?Some fundamental parts of a deal still require the presence of an independent financial adviser,? said Stuart Francis, a vice-chairman at Lehman Brothers in Silicon Valley.He cited the need for an independent valuation, the ability to engage in tough negotiations without damaging relationships and a complete understanding of how competitors might react.Twenty-four per cent of survey participants were operating in the technology sector, followed by industrial equipment makers and energy groups. Ninety-six per cent said they expected to do a merger within the next 24 months.

That was the question on many people's lips following last week's announcement that she is to replace Mario Monti as the European Union's antitrust chief for the next five years. It seemed a surprise appointment. But the Dutchwoman's experience in the worlds of politics and business mean she is well-equipped to take on Mr Monti's mantle on November 1.

A member of VVD, the Dutch free-market liberal party, Ms Kroes served two terms as minister for transport, public works and telecommunications during the 1980s and was also an adviser to Karel van Miert, the then EU transport commissioner. In addition, she has considerable private sector experience. That was an important factor in the decision by José Manuel Barroso, EU president-designate, to appoint her competition commissioner.Mr Monti was an extremely active competition commissioner, which raises the question of whether there will be anything left for his successor to do when she takes office. The answer is a resounding Yes.As well as the high-profile cases pending before the European Court of Justice - notably the appeals against Commission decisions on the General Electric/Honeywell merger and the Microsoft antitrust sanctions - a number of major policy areas will require Ms Kroes's attention.First, merger control. This is an area where the Commission has endured a turbulent few years. Following three court defeats in 2001, Mr Monti took steps to put the Commission's house in order. Brussels is now paying closer attention to due process and economic arguments. But these changes will only really be put to the test once there is an upturn in merger and acquisition activity. The new commissioner will then need to show that, even under pressure, the competition directorate can be sensitive to business's need for merger investigations to be predictable and transparent.Mr Monti has overseen a major overhaul of EU antitrust enforcement. Under the new modernised and decentralised framework, national competition authorities and courts within the EU will be much more involved in applying the European rules. One of the goals of this reform is to free Commission resources to concentrate on the more serious pan-European cases, especially cartels. But one of Ms Kroes's jobs will be to strike an appropriate balance between decentralisation of enforcement powers and maintenance of a “common competition culture” in the enlarged EU. Almost 35 years of political experience should help her achieve this delicate task.Dealing with abuses of market power by dominant companies is another cornerstone of EU antitrust policy. Whether and when a regulator should intervene against a powerful company is a fundamental question for an antitrust regime. But, despite some recent prominent cases, the Commission's overall policy in this difficult area, where law and economics meet, is unclear. Ms Kroes will be able to apply what she has learnt as a board member of some large companies to two urgent questions: whether to publish guidance on the Commission's policy for regulating dominance; and whether to make convergence with the less interventionist US antitrust law an EU objective.The areas where there is still the most work to be done, despite Mr Monti's efforts, are the opening of markets and the curbing of anticompetitive state funding. The treatment of state-owned companies is a particularly sensitive part of the competition commissioner's portfolio. The accession of new EU members and the need to enhance the competitiveness of the European economy only add to the challenge. Here, too, Ms Kroes has relevant experience, having overseen the privatisation of the Dutch postal and telecommunications service. She should be well-placed to continue the overhaul of state aid rules, based on a rigorous economics-based approach.Finally, in addition to the challenges in Europe, the new competition commissioner will have to operate in an antitrust environment that is increasingly global. Mr Monti has played a leading role in increasing the dialogue and convergence between antitrust agencies around the world. This network of relations is likely to become even more complex over the nextfive years, with the development ofantitrust regimes in Asia. Ms Kroes will need to draw on her international corporate experience to pursue this work. These would be big challenges for any competition commissioner. But on the evidence of her wide-ranging experience and what we know of her strong personality, Ms Kroes can be counted on to ensure the continued immunity of the post from political pressure and to push through the important initiatives set in motion by her predecessor.The writers, who are based, respectively, in Brussels and Amsterdam, are partners in the antitrust practice of the international law firm, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer"
