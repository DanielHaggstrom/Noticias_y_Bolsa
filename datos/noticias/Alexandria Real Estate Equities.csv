Until recently, most large drugmakers preferred to base their employees in sprawling fortress-like campuses of a size that were too large to build in New York.But now big pharma companies want to partner with smaller biotech groups at a much earlier stage, having recognised that many of the most promising medicines are being discovered by small, lean drugmakers.Judy Dunn, a senior Roche scientist, became one of Alexandria’s first tenants in 2014 when she moved from the company’s New Jersey campus along with 300 of her colleagues. She says the location better enables her team to keep abreast of the work being done by neighbouring biotech groups and academic institutions.“There’s lots of great biology going on here, and historically it’s been untapped,” says Ms Dunn. “By basing scientists here, big pharma has earlier access to emerging science.”Joel Marcus, chief executive of Alexandria, describes New York as “one of the hottest emerging biotech clusters in the world”. It has become a “top target for venture capitalists because it hasn’t been picked over by others”, he says.Venture capital financing has started to pick up in New York state, where biotech companies raised $256.5m last year, compared with $53.7m in 2014. But it still pales in comparison to Massachusetts, which raised $2bn in 2015, and California, with $4.8bn.“We do need more risk capital,” says Mr Marcus, who invests in some of Alexandria’s tenants through the company’s venture capital arm. “We need one or a handful of dramatic successes — a $10bn exit would have a big halo effect.”Given that there is no shortage of scientific talent — or money — in New York, why has it taken so long for a biotech industry to emerge in the city?Some financiers put it down to the culture at the city’s academic institutions, where many medical advances are discovered before being developed commercially.In California and Massachusetts, academic scientists often follow a well-trodden path whereby they spin out their discoveries into new companies backed by venture capital — but this route has rarely been travelled in New York.“New York’s research institutions have tended to license their technological discoveries to large biotech and pharmaceutical companies in return for a payment and a royalty,” says Thong Le, chief executive of Accelerator, a Seattle-based venture capital fund which has invested in a number of New York biotech start-ups.“In Silicon Valley, Cambridge and Boston, there’s this belief you can do more than just develop the technology,” says Mr Le. “If you’re lucky you can create a huge company.”In recent years, however, New York’s academic institutions have adopted a more commercial posture, following the appointment of leaders with strong links to the private sector. Marc Tessier-Lavigne, a former Genentech executive, is president of Rockefeller, while Laurie Glimcher, his counterpart at Cornell, is a director at Bristol-Myers Squibb.Efforts by New York’s former mayor, Michael Bloomberg, have also borne fruit. Creating a biotech hub in the city was the sort of project Mr Bloomberg enjoyed best, for his ability to corral private funding and support and combine it with city resources.Alexandria’s science centre was constructed with the help of government subsidies — $14m from the city, $27m from the state — and was built on New York City-owned land. During Mr Bloomberg’s tenure, the city also pledged to invest $150m into fledgling life sciences companies, using its own capital, along with funds from Celgene, Eli Lilly and GE.However, some scientists and executives say New York’s nascent biotech scene is at a tricky inflection point, and warn that its status as a hub for young companies is far from assured.Mr Tessier-Lavigne is leaving Rockefeller for Stanford in September, while Ms Glimcher will start a new job at Boston’s Dana Farber Cancer Institute in January, resulting in the departure of two of the city’s biggest biotech cheerleaders within months of each other.Mr Bloomberg left office more than two years ago, replaced by Bill de Blasio, a Democrat with different priorities.While few people are willing to criticise the current mayor on the record, many privately say he is less passionate about biotech. “He only cares about housing in Queens,” says one executive, derisively referring to Mr De Blasio’s affordable housing plan for New York’s outer boroughs.The $150m fund that was put together during Mr Bloomberg’s tenure has not yet been invested in any companies.“If leaders take a lukewarm approach, then things are just going to languish,” says Mr Le. “We’re not relying on the government to solve things, but a more supportive posture needs to be taken.”
1;ARE;Alexandria Real Estate Equities;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Vision test scope enhanced by i2eye;;Measuring the visual field of young children and other people who find it hard to sit still will become possible thanks to a company launched by the Edinburgh BioQuarter.The SVOP visual field analyser uses the patient’s reactions to movement and light to analyse their visual field even while the head is moving, and without them needing to understand the test or give feedback.A new company, i2eye Diagnostics, has signed an agreement with Kelvin Capital, a business investment syndicate, and others for a strategic investment to market its instrument by the middle of this year.The technology was developed by a team at Edinburgh university, consisting of ophthalmologists, neurologists and medical physicists, and led by Robert Minns, professor of paediatric neurology.Peter Estibeiro, i2eye chief executive, said: “Our instrument is a generation ahead of anything else on the market. One of its first applications is the monitoring …of children with brain tumours.”The market is estimated to be worth $280m in the US, with similar potential in Europe and Asia.Edinburgh BioQuarter is a joint venture between Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a US property group, the NHS, Edinburgh university and Scottish Enterprise, a government-funded development body. Including i2eye, it has launched three companies.Its first two launches were NeuroOrg, a consultancy, and ipSox, which supplies insulin pump accessories. The next two launches this year will be Investigational Supplies Group, which supports clinical trials, and Aquila Biomedical, a provider of drug research services.Edinburgh BioQuarter, a 20-hectare site in the south-east of the city, is part of the Scottish government’s life sciences enterprise area, which has been promised investment incentives.Mike Capaldi, commercialisation director at the BioQuarter, said: “i2eye is a world-first product in a solid market with a clear need. It’s also an excellent example of the leading-edge research being undertaken at Edinburgh. Investors should expect to see more companies like i2eye coming out of the BioQuarter.”
2;ARE;Alexandria Real Estate Equities;2009-11-04T02:55:51Z;Life sciences: Cluster with added lustre;;Scotland’s life science sector was given a boost with the recent official opening of a new building at Livingston by Quintiles Transnational that will create 150 jobs by 2011.Quintiles, a US-based biopharmaceuticals service company, has spent more than £9.5m ($15.6m) developing an 80,000 sq ft laboratory that will be used for clinical trials involving patients from all over Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.The US-based group, which employs 640 people at Livingston, received a £1.25m grant from the Scottish government.Jim Mather, minister for enterprise, energy and tourism, says: “In a challenging economic climate, the creation of 150 new jobs at Quintiles by 2011 is a boost for the West Lothian economy. Especially as this project, backed by regional selective assistance, underpins Scotland’s growing reputation for excellence in life sciences.”Scotland hosts one of Europe’s biggest life sciences clusters, with more than 600 organisations employing about 30,000 people, which adds £3bn to the Scottish economy annually. Its life science companies attract more than £400m of research funding annually, and Scotland has been recognised as one of the top five innovative regions in the world by industry experts.Andrew Henderson, manager of the life sciences team at Scottish Enterprise, the development body, says the sector has seen a lot of positive news this year.“It is very easy to get seduced by the sexy drug discovery stuff and where the next cure is coming from in life sciences,” he says. “But actually very vibrant parts of Scotland’s life sciences base are the clinical and contract research, and the medical technology area, which employ a lot of people and generate a lot or revenue.”The medical devices sector has been particularly active. Aircraft Medical, an Edinburgh-based company, has entered the growing market for monitoring how effectively patients are anaesthetised during surgery.The company makes video laryngoscopes, which are used by paramedics and anaesthetists to help insert a tube into the patient’s throat to control breathing. It recently bought Morpheus, a Barcelona-based company that measures the brain activity of patients during surgery or critical care.Alliance Boots has just started selling Breastlight, a powerful torch that helps women detect abnormalities that cannot be otherwise seen or felt. It was the first product of PWB Health, a company established two years ago to develop health products for home use.PWB was created by Wideblue, a Dumbarton-based spin-out from Polaroid that specialises in helping small technology-based companies develop products and manufacturing processes. Breastlight was licensed to PWB by Highland Innovation Centre, an Inverness-based medical device company that was established 12 years ago.Another successful medical device company is Touch Bionics, developer of the world’s first multi-articulating bionic hand, which was spun out of the NHS in 2003. It recently opened a centre at Livingston, which offers clinical services to amputees.The investment environment has also held up remarkably well, according to Scottish Enterprise. Last year was one of the best ever for investment in early stage life science companies with £22m raised, and a further £15.5m had already been raised by August this year.Forth Photonics, an Edinburgh-based company that makes imaging systems focusing on the non-invasive detection of cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions, raised £6m in January.Mr Henderson says: “Most of the industry in Scotland has not been funded by traditional venture capital – it has been by business angels, who take a much more positive view and see the opportunities. The message we get from the industry in Scotland is pretty positive – early stage companies are weathering the storm – and there is money out there for good propositions.”However, the recent economic turmoil is expected to slow the development of the flagship Edinburgh BioQuarter scheme, which aims to position Scotland as one of the world’s top 10 hubs for life sciences research and development, generating £250m of investment on site over the next 15 years and creating 6,500 new jobs.The BioQuarter is a partnership between Scottish Enterprise, Edinburgh University, NHS Lothian and Alexandria Real Estates Equities, the US life sciences property specialist. It combines Edinburgh’s top-ranked medical school, the Royal Edinburgh Infirmary and a science campus with 1.5m sq ft of academic and commercial accommodation that is intended to act as a magnet for some of the world’s leading life sciences academics, students and clinicians.The first building to be built on the science campus is Edinburgh University’s £50m Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine, which is due for completion next year.Mr Henderson says: “If there has been any slowdown at all, it has been in the provision of commercial property facilities – which is not a big surprise in the current environment, with the global property markets being squeezed.“Having gone with a private sector partner, they are maybe not progressing quite as quickly as we had first hoped, but they are very committed to Scotland still, and I would expect to see stuff happening in the not too distant future.”
3;ARE;Alexandria Real Estate Equities;2009-11-04T02:55:51Z;Who’s who: Leading lights in business and politics;;"Simon BestProfessor Simon Best, a leading life-science entrepreneur, was recently appointed to lead the commercialisation drive at Edinburgh’s BioQuarter, one of Scotland’s flagship projects. The BioQuarter is a partnership between Scottish Enterprise, Edinburgh University, NHS Lothian and Alexandria Real Estates Equities, the US-based life sciences property specialist. Prof Best will steer the project to try to ensure that a recently announced £12m ($20m) injection of funds boosts commercial activity at the university’s college of medicine and veterinary medicine, to help translate its world-leading research into new therapies for patients and products and services for the global life science industry. A serial entrepreneur, Prof Best has a track record in life sciences commercialisation, founding substantial ventures such as Zeneca Plant Science, Roslin Biomed and Ardana. Over a 15-year period, he has built a portfolio of both executive and non-executive roles with life sciences companies and investors around the world and helped raise more than £130m of funding in the sector.Keith CochraneKeith Cochrane will this month take over as chief executive of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company that competes successfully in the global market for mining, oil and gas and power generation equipment. He succeeds Mark Selway, who is leaving after eight years in the top job to become chief executive of Boral, the largest building and construction materials supplier in his native Australia. Mr Cochrane has been finance director since 2006 of Weir, which has annual sales of £1.5bn, employs more than 9,000 people and operates in 42 countries. He is well known on the Scottish corporate scene, having previously been finance director of ScottishPower. Before that he was with Stagecoach Group, where he was finance director before becoming chief executive in 2000. Lord Smith of Kelvin, Weir’s chairman, says: “Keith is ideally equipped to succeed Mark, given his global experience, knowledge of Weir’s core markets and his outstanding leadership qualities.”Benny HigginsBenny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, is that rarest of creatures in Scottish financial circles these days: a senior banker who is hiring, rather than firing. The Edinburgh-based bank, formerly Tesco Personal Finance, was established 12 years ago as a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Higgins was hired in July last year, when Tesco bought out RBS’s share for £950m. Few people are better placed to recruit banking staff than Mr Higgins. Having been a high-flyer at both Standard Life, the Edinburgh-based life assurer, and RBS, he was ousted from HBOS in 2007 after just over a year as head of its retail bank. Earlier this year Mr Higgins said the Tesco bank would add more than 200 jobs to its existing staff of 250, based at new Edinburgh headquarters beside Haymarket railway station. In August, he announced plans to create more than 800 jobs at a new customer service centre in Glasgow.Archie KaneArchie Kane, Scotland’s representative on the main board of Lloyds Banking Group, has emerged as the group’s executive director of insurance and will be running one of the UK’s biggest life assurance and general insurance businesses out of Edinburgh. The insurance arm of the giant new bank – the product of last autumn’s shotgun marriage between Lloyds TSB and the stricken HBOS – will combine the 194-year-old Scottish Widows life assurance business, which employs 3,000 in Edinburgh, with 185-year-old Clerical Medical, which is supported by 2,000 HBOS employees in Bristol. Lloyds has promised to retain the Bristol headquarters, but the Clerical Medical brand will be phased out. Mr Kane will be directing his new empire from the splendid historic headquarters of Bank of Scotland, which merged with the Halifax mortgage bank in 2001. He is concerned that Scots are exaggerating the damage done to their financial institutions, and stresses that Scotland’s life assurers and fund managers have come through the financial crisis “rather well”.Jim MatherJim Mather, minister for enterprise, energy, and tourism, is unusual among members of the Scottish government – and indeed members of the Scottish parliament in general – in having a strong business background. Trained as a chartered accountant, he worked for 10 years for IBM before forming his own computer business. His pro-business stance is appreciated in the commercial world, though he does have a weakness for techniques such as “mind-mapping” problems and quoting jargon from the latest management books. Mr Mather became the Scottish National party’s MSP for Argyll and Bute at the 2007 elections to Holyrood, and has worked hard to persuade the business community that independence could be an opportunity, rather than a threat. From 2000 until 2004, Mr Mather was the SNP’s national treasurer. At the 2003 Scottish election, he was elected as a Highlands and Islands MSP and was a member of the SNP’s shadow cabinet as enterprise and economy spokesman.Fiona McBainFiona McBain is chief executive of Scottish Friendly Assurance, a Glasgow-based mutual that has roots stretching back to 1862. Although now the largest mutual life office in Scotland, it is still a comparative minnow, with assets under management of £704m at the start of this year. However, under Ms McBain, who has been chief executive since 2006, Scottish Friendly has punched well above its weight by investing in award-winning information technology systems and now claims to have one of the most efficient back office operations in the UK. This has allowed it to administer “wrap” platforms for much bigger companies, such as Aviva (previously Norwich Union). A chartered accountant with more than 20 years experience in the financial services industry, Ms McBain has also forged partnerships with Readers’ Digest and Soccer Savings – through which it promotes savings plans to the supporters of clubs such as Rangers and Celtic in Glasgow, and Portsmouth and Birmingham City south of the border.Michelle MoneMichelle Mone, creator of the Ultimo lingerie brand, is one of Scotland’s most high-profile entrepreneurs. Born in the east end of Glasgow, she left school at 15 and did some modelling before joining Labatt, the Canadian beer company, as a sales representative, becoming a senior manager by the time she was 20. But following the sale of Labatt’s UK arm to Whitbread, she found herself with a pay-off and no clear idea what to do. Ms Mone had what she describes as her “light-bulb” moment while attending a dinner dance wearing a push-up bra that was very uncomfortable. She decided to invent a gel-filled bra that was more comfortable and cleavage-enhancing. She established MJM International with her husband, Michael, in 1996. Ms Mone has recently opened 20 “shops in shops” within Debenhams stores around the UK and is designing and manufacturing “Diamond Boutique” lingerie for Tesco.Steven PurcelSteven Purcell has been leader of Glasgow City Council since 2005, when he was elected to the post – unopposed – at the age of 32. He has lived all his life in Yoker in the west of the city. After leaving school at the age of 16, Mr Purcell started work on a Youth Training Scheme in a building society, and was first elected to the council in 1995. He is a strong supporter of regeneration, and as education convener delivered a controversial £220m public-private partnership scheme to refurbish or rebuild the city’s 29 secondary schools. Often tipped as a future leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Mr Purcell appears to be in no rush to move to Holyrood, and is expected to wait until after the 2014 Commonwealth Games are held in Glasgow before moving on to the national stage. He describes getting people off benefits and back to work as his number one priority.Joan StringerProfessor Joan Stringer, principal and vice-chancellor of Edinburgh Napier University, was this year named by the Institute of Directors Scotland both public sector director of the year and regional director of the year for Edinburgh, Lothians and Borders. Prof Stringer, who was awarded a CBE in 2001, was singled out for her significant contribution to higher education both in the UK and internationally. She was praised for her leadership skills at the newly-renamed Edinburgh Napier University, which was ranked last year as number one for graduate employability in Scotland by the Higher Education Statistics Agency and the top modern university in Scotland in the Guardian University Guide 2009. Edinburgh Napier University is enjoying increasing international recognition though its global partnerships and knowledge transfer activities. Prof Stringer has also received awards from Shandong and Henan Provinces in China in recognition of her contribution to higher education there.Mark TennantMark Tennant, senior adviser to JP Morgan, was recently appointed chairman of Scottish Financial Enterprise (SFE), the trade body for the beleaguered sector. Mr Tennant brings wide experience to the post, with a 36-year career spanning almost all major areas of financial services including investment banking, fund management and pensions. He has strong international experience, having worked in Edinburgh, London, the US and Hong Kong. In addition to his role at JP Morgan, Mr Tennant is a member of the international advisory board of T Rowe Price Global Investor Services, a US global asset managers, and chairman of Bluerock, a management consultancy. On his appointment to the SFE, Mr Tennant said: “Our industry has, understandably, been under intense scrutiny over the last 18 months and I have admired the way SFE has responded to that. But we still have a long way to go before the trust so essential to successful financial services is fully restored; and I relish the chance to contribute to SFE’s continuing efforts to make that happen.”"
4;ARE;Alexandria Real Estate Equities;2007-09-20T03:58:59Z;Life sciences: A fertile environment for culture to develop;;Scotland is home to one of the biggest and fastest expanding life science “clusters” in Europe, thanks partly to a strategic alliance between industry, government, universities and National Health Service Scotland.It has more than 15 per cent of the UK’s life science companies, a total of nearly 600 organisations and 30,000 employees. Current company turnover is estimated at more than £2.5bn, with gross value added (GVA) put at well over £1bn.Figures from the Office of National Statistics show annual GVA growth rates of 7 to 8 per cent, about four times the average growth rate of the Scottish economy.Scottish Enterprise, the development body, says: “This is very encouraging, as GVA does not take account of the non-trading part of the sector which makes a major contribution in life sciences. In addition, these figures do not fully reflect the long lead times for drug development, when a company is investing tens of millions on R&D to take its products to market and become profitable.”Scotland’s strategic approach to developing the industry has led to a recent stream of high-profile investment decisions. Further Scottish government funding of £24m, confirmed at the start of the year, is allowing Edinburgh University to develop a £59m Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine that is likely to be equalled only by one in Kobe, Japan.Headed by Ian Wilmut, who helped create Dolly, the cloned sheep, at the nearby Roslin Institute, the centre will house 220 academic researchers and include space for the development and manufacture of cells, as well as commercial regenerative medicine.In an effort to boost Edinburgh’s appeal to the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries, Scottish Enterprise recently announced a partnership with Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a US property company specialising in life sciences developments.The deal will rebrand the Centre for Biomedical Research, which includes the centre for regenerative medicine, as Edinburgh BioQuarter. The goal is to build Britain’s most spectacular life sciences centre with a reputation to rival San Francisco’s Mission Bay, Singapore’s Biopolis and Stockholm’s Novum Biocity.Alexandria has won exclusive rights to develop Edinburgh BioQuarter in collaboration with Edinburgh University, the National Health Service and Scottish Enterprise. The partners aim eventually to generate £250m of investment and create 6,500 jobs on the 100-acre Little France site.Announcing the collaboration in May at the Bio conference in Boston, Joel Marcus, Alexandria’s chief executive, said: “We believe Edinburgh BioQuarter will become a life science magnet that not only supports local emerging biotechnology companies but will attract some of the larger international life sciences companies as well.”Scotland’s Life Science Alliance, a group of senior representatives drawn from the sector, says one reason so many Scottish research groups choose to collaborate is because they are within easy reach of one another.“Within 50 miles of the cities of Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow, you will find 80 per cent of Scotland’s life science industry,” it says.Collaboration was key to the £50m deal Wyeth, the US pharmaceutical group, signed last year with Scottish Enterprise and four universities to create a pioneering medical research network.The universities of Dundee, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow and NHS Scotland agreed to link in a “translational medicine” collaboration with Wyeth, the Philadelphia-based group, to test what drugs are best for patients with heart disease, cancer, depression or osteoporosis.Wyeth agreed to invest about £33m over five years, with an option to extend for a further five years. Scottish Enterprise will invest up to £17.5m, which it hopes to recover through spin-off diagnostics companies.The deal followed a search for potential partners by Wyeth across the US and Europe. It chose Scotland because of its strong medical research tradition, the ability to work with four universities with up to 500 academics and the scope to work with a high proportion of Scotland’s 5m patients, most of whose details are entered in electronic databases.Andrew Morris of Dundee University, an expert in diabetes, says one factor that attracted Wyeth was Generation Scotland, a programme that seeks to recruit up to 50,000 Scottish volunteers for a study on the way genetics and lifestyle factors affect disease.“There has been a fantastic spirit of co-operation between the academic institutions, and the NHS Scotland is too small to be considered as anything other than one research site,” says Prof Morris.Tom Shepherd, chief executive of CXR Biosciences and chairman of the Life Sciences Alliance, confirms that the connections and integration that existed between different groups in Scotland were a key contributor to the establishment of the translational medicine project with Wyeth.But he adds: “The challenge ahead lies in taking the integration and alliance between sectors to a higher level, as it is only through a focused and coherent approach that a small country such as Scotland can fulfil its vision of becoming a key player in the global life sciences industry.”
5;ARE;Alexandria Real Estate Equities;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
