This left his successor, Thierry Vanlancker, to fulfil pledges made in the heat of battle.Some investors and analysts are sceptical that Akzo can hit its goal of a 15 per cent return on sales by 2020, a profit metric equivalent to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes.But Mr Vanlancker, who requested his bonus be tied to the targets set by his predecessor, said the manufacturer of paints and surface coatings was on track.“With all the measures that we take, we actually feel pretty comfortable,” he said. “It’s a lot of work, but I think we have the plans to get there.”The company recently announced a plan to deliver €200m in cost savings by 2020. It is reorganising supply chains, and overheads are also expected to be cut in administration and research and development.Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, which strips out central costs, was 12.3 per cent in Akzo’s most recent third-quarter, up from 10 per cent in the same period a year before.“In fact, if you add all our plans up . . . you actually end up higher than 15 per cent [by 2020],” said Mr Vanlancker.“We don’t talk about failure. It’s really around getting a 225-year-old company into a modern shape for the future. And I think we’re on our way.”Some of the improvement in profitability has come by focusing on sales of higher-value products and, as a result, reducing the volumes the company shifts, especially in China, where a slowdown in construction has hit demand for paint. But Mr Vanlancker ruled out any further exits from low-margin ranges.Akzo has returned most of the net proceeds from the €10bn disposal this year of its speciality chemicals division.The transaction delivered another promise made by Akzo during the fight with PPG and left the Amsterdam-based group focused on its core area of paints and coatings, which are used to protect surfaces of objects like ship hulls.However, the upwards trajectory in profit margin at the reshaped Akzo has failed to convince all investors. One top-10 shareholder said: “Despite good news on the governance side and [the sale of] speciality chemicals, there has been a tremendous amount of value destruction.”Shares in Akzo are trading at about €70, compared with PPG’s final cash-and-stock offer of €96.75 per share, although currency movements and the speciality chemicals sale account for some of that difference.Another question for investors is whether Akzo will engage in any big-ticket deal activity of its own in the $130bn global paints and coatings industry.Although Akzo has made about 10 bolt-on acquisitions over the past year, Mr Vanlancker said he was “not so sure that consolidation is a must”.
1;PPG;PPG Industries;2018-10-25T15:59:04Z;Trian urges paint maker PPG to oust CEO, launch strategic review;;Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management is urging the paints and coatings company PPG to oust its chief executive officer Michael McGarry, bring back its last CEO in order to halt its sliding share price, and launch a strategic review of the business.Ed Garden, Trian’s chief investment officer, pitched the fund’s investment thesis at an investor conference in Toronto today, where he said PPG’s former CEO Chuck Bunch, who oversaw the company for a decade up until 2015, should be brought back. The investment fund owns 2.9 per cent of PPG.“Trian’s preference has always been to work with the existing management team whenever possible, as evidenced by our history of interactions with companies,” said Mr Garden. “However, in this particular instance, after three years of significant underperformance driven by operating and strategic mishaps, we believe change is warranted and now is the right time to bring back Chuck Bunch.”The company responded that in meetings its directors have had with Trian since the fund disclosed its stake earlier this month, they agreed to “a constructive and private dialogue,” and “made clear that the board of directors unanimously supports Michael McGarry as chairman and CEO, but that PPG and the board are opening to listening to Trian on other topics.”The company said:The PPG board of directors also believes that the company’s strategic plan has positioned PPG to drive growth and increase shareholder value. The management team remains actively focused on delivering strong results, including top-quartile operating margins, in a challenging macro environment for the industry and continuing to grow its business through innovative technology and disciplined acquisitions.We have emphasised returning cash to shareholders, dedicating about 65% of our cash deployment in 2016 and 2017 to dividends and share repurchases — $2.7 billion in total — with an additional $1.6 billion through the first three quarters of 2018.Since 2015, organic sales and earnings per share at the paint maker have stalled, and the company issued a profit warning in the third quarter — the third straight year that PPG has had to do so — and has grappled with accounting irregularities.PPG attempted an audacious €27bn hostile takeover of its Dutch rival Akzo Nobel last year, but ended up withdrawing rather than take its offer direct to Akzo’s shareholders following a protracted and bitter fight.A merger would have created a dominant player in the $130bn global paints and coatings industry, resulting in cost savings and a combination of PPG’s expertise in liquid coatings with Akzo’s strong position in powder coatings.But by tabling its first bid less than two weeks before elections in the Netherlands, the Pittsburgh-based company appeared to misjudge the mood: a political backlash ensued that bolstered Akzo’s defence.Founded in the 1880s as Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, PPG has in recent years been in transition from a diversified industrial conglomerate into a more focused company, which along with coatings and paints also supplies sealants for cars and aircraft.But competitors like Axalta, which was spun out of Dupont, have been encroaching on PPG’s mainstay of automotive coatings, according to analysts.Mr McGarry is a company lifer who has risen through the ranks of PPG since taking his first job in 1981, along the way building a reputation for integrating a number of acquisitions.“PPG is at an important crossroads where decisions today regarding portfolio optimisation, capital structure and involvement in potential industry consolidation will dictate long-term value creation,” Mr Garden said.Trian is also calling for a strategic review.
2;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-11-22T07:42:53Z;Nippon Paint upends Axalta-AkzoNobel merger talks;US company and Dutch rival scrap discussions after Japanese group’s all-cash offer;Nippon Paint has gatecrashed friendly talks between a US and a Dutch rival by submitting an all-cash takeover bid for Axalta Coating Systems, in a rare intervention by a Japanese company in cross-border dealmaking.According to people close to the situation, Nippon Paint submitted an offer this week that valued Axalta at a much higher premium to the figure being contemplated by the US group as it held talks with Amsterdam-based AkzoNobel.In response, Axalta and Akzo announced late on Tuesday that they had terminated discussions about a merger after failing to reach terms.Axalta said on Wednesday that it was in talks with Nippon Paint about selling itself to the Japanese group, but added that there could be no assurances that a definitive agreement would be reached by the parties.Nippon Paint confirmed that it had made “a proposal” but did not give details and cautioned that there was no certainty of any deal.As in other industries in Japan, paintmakers are seeking overseas expansion as they try to escape shrinking domestic markets, boost growth and take advantage of ultra-low borrowing rates. Nippon Paint and smaller rival Kansai Paint have both stated a desire to secure a stronger place in the global coatings business.A wave of merger and acquisition activity has radically reshaped the wider chemicals industry over the past few years, as companies have sought greater scale and cost savings at a time of weak demand growth.Shares in US-listed Axalta fell nearly 15 per cent in after-market trading on Tuesday, only to recover after news of the bid by Nippon Paint, which was first reported by Reuters. Axalta has a market value of $8.3bn.Nippon Paint shares dropped 4.5 per cent on Wednesday morning in Tokyo before trading was suspended, giving it a market value of $10.2bn. Analysts said any deal for Axalta would put further pressure on Nippon Paint’s stock price, but that it would fulfil an important management ambition. For Akzo, the unsuccessful Axalta talks are the latest setback in a year that has seen it come under pressure to break up its business, fend off multiple unwanted takeover bids from another US rival, PPG Industries, and lose its chief executive and chief financial officer.Akzo and Axalta were discussing an all-stock deal that would have valued Axalta at a low premium, people involved in those talks said previously. However, this would have been complicated because of the gulf in size between the two groups. Akzo’s decorative paints and performance coatings divisions together had sales of €9.5bn in 2016, while Axalta’s total revenues were $4.1bn.“After pursuing a potential combination of Axalta and Akzo, we concluded we could not negotiate a transaction on terms that meet our criteria,” said Charles W Shaver, Axalta’s chairman and chief executive.”Akzo’s flirtation with Axalta was seen by some partly as a way to deter PPG, which under Dutch takeover rules can table another bid in December when a six-month “cooling-off” period expires.Akzo meanwhile said it was on track to separate its speciality chemicals division and return the vast majority of proceeds to shareholders, a decision that was taken as part of its defence against the advances from PPG.
3;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-11-22T00:44:37Z;Japan’s Nippon Paint makes bid for Axalta;;Japan’s Nippon Paint has submitted an all-cash takeover offer for rival Axalta Coatings System, prompting the US company to break off merger discussions with Akzo Nobel.The offer marks a rare intervention by a Japanese company into what were otherwise friendly discussions between Axalta and Akzo Nobel, a Dutch paints and coatings company. Reuters first reported Nippon Paint’s intervention.According to two people close to the situation, Nippon Paint made the offer, which values Axalta at a premium to its current share price, early on Wednesday. Nippon Paint may make a statement later on Wednesday to confirm the offer.Akzo Nobel and its US rival Axalta confirmed they had ended discussions over a possible combination that first became public in October. Their talks came just months after Akzo fended off an unwanted €27bn takeover approach from PPG Industries, a larger US competitor.A deal between Akzo and Axalta would have brought together the third and fourth-largest companies in the $130bn global coatings market, according to analysts.Akzo and Axalta were discussing a stock deal that was framed as a “merger of equals” and that would have valued Axalta at a low premium, people involved in those talks previously said.Nippon Paint has a market capitalisation of $10.7bn. The Japanese company’s shares were 2.4 per cent lower on Wednesday morning.
4;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-10-30T15:52:28Z;Akzo confirms merger talks with coatings group Axalta;Deal will create obstacle to any renewed takeover attempt from PPG Industries;Dutch paintmaker AkzoNobel confirmed on Monday that it was in talks to combine with US rival Axalta Coating Systems, in a deal that would bring together two top producers of industrial coatings and create an obstacle to any renewed takeover attempt from PPG Industries.Akzo, which is best known for its Dulux household paints, said it was in “constructive discussions” with Axalta, the industry leader in making automotive refinish paints.It comes just months after Akzo successfully fended off PPG in a bruising €27bn takeover battle that saw the US paints group lose in a drawn-out and bitter affair.The disclosure followed reports on Friday that linked the Dutch company to an approach, sending shares in Axalta soaring to give it a market value of more than $8bn.Akzo characterised the discussions as “constructive” and potentially leading to a combination through a “merger of equals” with its paints and coatings unit. Axalta said it was engaged in talks, but cautioned that there was no certainty that a definitive agreement between the parties will be reached.The deal would be mainly done through shares, said a person familiar with the situation.Akzo’s new chief executive, Thierry Vanlancker, previously led operations in polymers, performance coatings and chemicals at DuPont, which sold off its performance coatings business in 2013. It was rebranded Axalta by its then private equity owner Carlyle.A deal would bring together the third and fourth-largest players in the $130bn global coatings market, according to analysts.Coatings are used to protect surfaces from corrosion and wear in a wide range of industries.The deal may also be designed to see off PPG, which under Dutch takeover rules can table another bid from the start of December, when a six-month “cooling-off” period runs out.One top 20 shareholder in Akzo described the potential combination as “strategically and financially unsound”.Any deal with Axalta is likely to require a vote of approval by Akzo’s shareholders, many of whom openly rebuked the company’s management for refusing to enter into negotiations with PPG. They included the activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors, the largest shareholder. Elliott declined to comment on the proposed merger with Axalta.Both Akzo and Axalta were keen to portray the structure of the potential deal as a merger of equals. However, this is complicated by the gulf in size between the two companies. Akzo’s decorative paints and performance coatings divisions together had sales of €9.5bn in 2016, while Axalta’s total revenues were $4.1bn.Analysts at Bernstein said they believed an Akzo-Axalta combination could find annual cost savings of about €250m, while several other brokers welcomed the proposed deal.“The rational is clear, and the timing excellent . . . ave for a long time argued that . . . [a] combination would make a lot of sense strategically,” wrote Patrick Lambert of Raymond James.Akzo said the planned separation of its speciality chemicals division, announced as part of its defence strategy against PPG, was unaffected by the talks with Axalta and on track for completion by April, with shareholders to receive the “vast majority” of net proceeds.As part of its resistance to PPG, Akzo’s management set out increased financial targets but has since abandoned a goal of generating €100m extra in earnings before interest and tax this year. Its chief executive and chief financial officer departed shortly after fending off PPG.Shares in Akzo were up 0.7 per cent to €78.04 on Monday.
5;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-10-30T15:11:32Z;Akzo/Axalta: applying a gloss;Keeping the US company’s managers on board will make the deal more polished;Repair shops use a low-bake oven to harden paint and keep dust away from resprayed cars. AkzoNobel needs to purify the atmosphere too as it pursues a merger with Axalta Coating Systems, a US group whose coatings adorn many vehicles.On Monday, the Dutch group confirmed it is in talks on a “merger of equals” with Axalta. Inevitably, the transaction is being viewed by some as a protective coating to ward off US rival PPG Industries. PPG tried and failed to take over Akzo earlier this year, and under Dutch takeover rules could re-enter the fray as early as December.PPG’s bid for Akzo contemplated $750m of annual cost savings, just under 5 per cent of the target’s historic sales. Applying that percentage to Axalta implies savings of $185m. Taxed and capitalised, they could be worth $1.4bn. But under the merger of equals structure envisaged by Akzo, those savings would have to be shared with Axalta’s shareholders.The key question is, in what proportion? The answer is complicated by Akzo’s plan to sell or demerge its speciality chemicals business and return any net proceeds to shareholders, leaving a smaller but more focused group. This should go ahead next year, regardless of the outcome of the Axalta talks.UBS thinks the specialty chemicals sale could fetch €9.2bn. Strip that out and add in Axalta’s undisturbed enterprise value — the shares jumped when deal reports surfaced — and you get a pro forma total of $24.3bn. Based on forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation before any cost savings, Axalta’s investors should own about 38 per cent of that — equivalent, backing out each company’s most recent net debt figures, to about $24 per share.That is below Axalta’s $28 share price before the talks became public. Either the rise in Axalta’s shares, already rated higher than Akzo’s, has been over-exuberant or Akzo is set to pay a premium to its own valuation and rely on cost savings to justify it.One way to assuage the concerns of investors, who would have to vote on any deal, might be to apply the merger of equals logic to the division of boardroom jobs. Axalta’s managers are highly regarded, having raised ebitda margins by about 8 percentage points since 2012. That partly explains the company’s higher multiple. Keeping them on board would make the transaction look more polished.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly Best of Lex email at ft.com/newsletters.
6;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-09-08T06:33:39Z;Chemicals maker Akzo Nobel issues profit warning;;Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel has issued a profits warning just weeks after settling a bitter shareholder feud over its decision to reject a takeover bid from a US rival.The bad news comes as shareholders gathered on Friday for an extraordinary meeting to consider a range of measures aimed at improving shareholder relations, announced in response to criticism of the board’s decision to rebuff the approach of paints and coatings rival PPG Industries.Akzo, owner of the Dulux brand of paints, said in a statement on Friday results for 2017 would be: “higher than 2016 although by less than the previously communicated increase of €100 million”.Thierry Vanlancker, chief executive appointed in July in its midst of the row with its activist shareholder Elliott Advisors, said in a statement: “Current challenges in the paints and coatings market are having a wider and greater impact as the year continues and we are dealing with these head on”.In mid August Akzo said it had ended the battle with Elliott by agreeing to appoint three new directors to its board.The company said on Friday it was facing a range of challenges from “unfavourable foreign exchange rates, continued headwinds for the marine and protective coatings industry, temporary disruption to the manufacturing and supply chain during the third quarter and current margin pressure from greater than expected raw material cost inflation”.The company also announced a management overhaul at its paints and coatings business.It said a “new, fully integrated, management structure will increase customer focus, drive further operational excellence, and build greater momentum and speed across the business.”It said the changes were implemented to achieve the ambition of hitting a target of 15 per cent return on sales and more than 25 per cent return on investment for the paints and coatings business by 2020.In a separate announcement on Friday Akzo Nobel said the chief financial officer Maelys Castella was stepping down due to health reasons.Hans De Vriese, the group controller, becomes interim CFO while the the company looks for a permanent replacement.
7;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-08-16T06:33:30Z;Akzo Nobel and Elliott call three-month litigation truce;;Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel and activist investor Elliott Advisors have called a legal truce of at least three months in a long-running feud over a €27bn takeover approach.Following a fresh move to oust Akzo’s chairman last month, the two sides said they had reached terms on a “standstill” agreement that would suspend litigation procedures.Under the terms, Elliott said it would support the nomination of Thierry Vanlancker – Akzo’s new chief executive – as a member of the company’s board. The Dutch paint giant will also make three nominations to its supervisory board – in a move backed by Elliott.The detente comes after the hedge fund applied to Dutch courts for a special shareholder meeting to remove chairman Antony Burgmans after he was seen as an obstacle to a takeover deal by rival PPG Industries earlier this year.The merger would have created a world leader in the paint market worth €130bn.Gordon Singer, chief executive of Elliott said:We believe AkzoNobel will benefit from the addition of the Supervisory Board nominees.Today’s agreement marks an important next step in positioning AkzoNobel for success and enabling the Company to deliver compelling value to all its stakeholders.Akzo’s supervisory board appointments are Sue Clark and Patrick Thomas and one other. Mr Burgmans said:I am pleased our recent constructive discussions with Elliott improved understanding between both parties.This agreement is fully in line with our ongoing program to strengthen and maintain a constructive dialogue with all our shareholders.
8;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-07-25T05:47:05Z;Akzo Nobel Q2 core earnings misses estimates;;Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paintmaker under pressure from the hedge fund Elliott, has posted second-quarter core earnings below market expectations but said it was still on track for the figure to be €100m higher this year.The owner of the Dulux brand generated adjusted earnings before interest of €461m in the period, down on a year earlier and missing analysts’ forecasts by 7 per cent. Revenue was up 2 per cent to €3.79bn but also came in below consensus estimates.The company, which in June fended off a €27bn takeover approach from US rival PPG Industries following a three-month battle, last week appointed Thierry Vanlancker as its new chief executive following the surprise resignation of former boss Ton Büchner.Management said Akzo’s measure of core profit was impacted by continued weak demand in marine and protective coatings, higher raw material costs and planned maintenance turnarounds in its industrial chemicals business. Production volumes increased at its decorative paints and speciality chemicals divisions but were flat overall.However, Akzo said that it still expected ebit to be €100m greater than in 2016 as previously announced “assuming no further material changes in market and economic dynamics, including foreign currencies.”Akzo also said it would hold a special shareholder meeting on 8 September. Elliott, which unsuccessfully pushed for a deal with PPG, has asked when investors will be given a vote on the appointment of the new chief executive.
9;PPG;PPG Industries;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-07-19T16:06:04Z;Akzo Nobel: injured in battle;Ton Büchner’s departure, due to ill health, may make an eventual takeover more likely;"Play the ball not the man is all very well as an aphorism during times of concord. But the bitter €27bn struggle over Akzo Nobel has clearly had an impact on the health of Ton Büchner, chief executive, who announced his resignation on Wednesday. His departure could yet make a deal with suitor PPG more likely.Overall, Mr Büchner did a creditable job at Akzo. Since his appointment in 2012, worries over a once gaping pension deficit are gone and operating margins are growing thanks to shrewd cost-cutting. But growth eluded him; operating income has been broadly flat for the past two financial years and earnings per share for longer than that. A combination with US-based PPG, with its attendant cost savings and economies of scale, would have driven profits higher. His refusal to engage meaningfully with the company was misguided and irritated shareholders.Thierry Vanlancker, who most recently ran the company’s speciality chemicals division, is the new chief. One of his first priorities will be to separate the business he used to lead, either via a sale or an initial public offering. Doing so would leave Akzo as a more focused paints and coatings business, which would be likely to be valued at a higher multiple of profits. It would also make a more attractive target for PPG, which was never particularly interested in the chemicals unit.The US group must wait until December 1 before submitting a fresh bid. It faces a further obstacle in the form of Antony Burgmans, the formidable supervisory board chairman. He dismissed the 50 per cent takeover premium to Akzo’s undisturbed share price as “poor”, and bore the brunt of shareholder anger over the lack of engagement. Activist shareholder Elliott Management, which wanted talks with PPG, is going to court in Amsterdam next week to try and force an extraordinary shareholder meeting to vote him off the board.Even if it does not succeed, Mr Burgmans will not be around too much longer. His second term ends in May 2018 — a month after Akzo plans to reveal how it will divest chemicals — and he is not eligible for re-election.The stock stood unchanged at €78 on Wednesday, unfazed by news of Mr Büchner’s departure. This is roughly midway between the undisturbed price and PPG’s final offer. That suggests investors believe this company, or part of it, will be taken over eventually.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Does the chief executive’s departure help clear the way for a fresh bid? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below."

The US, they believed, would become the promised land for European companies leaving behind economic wobbles and political upheavals. But the opposite has happened. Improved economic prospects, the defeat of populist anti-EU parties in Dutch and French elections and the chaos consuming the Trump administration flipped the script. Chief executives and their boards quickly regained confidence, according to mergers and acquisitions advisers, to consider ambitious mergers and acquisitions in countries such as Italy, France, Germany and Spain.“The macro and political uncertainty is more acute in the US. It is not a coincidence that we are seeing activity shift towards Europe this year,” according to Gary Posternack, global head of M&A at Barclays.Renewed confidence in the eurozone has attracted acquisitive firms in the US and Asia alongside a spate of large European mergers.“The four largest deals this year have all had European targets, and Europe is the only region in which M&A volumes are up year over year,” Mr Posternack says. “European activity has been supported by both an improving economy and a perception of lower political risk.""Some of this year’s biggest deals involving European targets include the €50bn eyewear merger between Italy’s Luxottica and France’s Essilor, the $30bn takeover of Swiss biotech group Actelion by US rival Johnson & Johnson and the €16.3bn acquisition of Spanish infrastructure group Abertis by its larger Italian rival Atlantia.Overall targeted European deal volumes climbed a third to $440.5bn in the first six months of 2017, according to Thomson Reuters, compared with the same period a year ago.Some of the countries worst hit by the eurozone crisis over the past eight years attracted the highest levels of activity. Deal activity in Spain jumped by 157 per cent to $53bn. In Italy, volumes rose by 35 per cent to $39bn, and in France transactions were up 17 per cent to $74bn.The four largest deals this year have all had European targets, and Europe is the only region in which an M&A volumes are up year over yearM&A activity in Europe could have even overtaken the US — which still maintained the top regional spot with $559bn worth of deals in spite of a slow start to the year — if some American companies hunting for assets had not been rebuffed. The most notable failed takeover attempts were KraftHeinz’s $143bn bid to acquire Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever and an unsolicited bid for Akzo Nobel by US rival PPG Industries valued at nearly $30bn.Despite the resurgence of European M&A activity, some bankers in the US argue that it would be a mistake to assume that deal volumes in North America will remain subdued. Advisors blame the year’s slow start on steep US equity market valuations and the Trump administration’s failure to live up to expectations, particularly around tax reform. Kurt Simon, global chairman of M&A at JPMorgan, says: “The year is off to a slower start but we are still optimistic about the level of activity. Our backlog is very strong. Strategic dialogue has been active in the last six weeks so we are hopeful it will lead to a pick-up in the second half of 2017.""Advisers say that the fundamental drivers of M&A are still in place: “Companies want to do things, GDP wise we are still growing 1-2 per cent, so if you want to grow, you likely need to look to M&A . . . so that will help get activity back to higher levels,” adds Mr Simon.—————-News: Buyouts rise to highest level for a decade

Chinese groups have inked just two deals of that size this year.The smaller, less-frequent dealmaking from China is seen by advisers as a direct result of a government crackdown on aggressive corporate acquirers that have bought up tens of billions of international businesses in just the past two years. Starting with capital controls put in place by China’s foreign exchange regulator late last year, the crackdown has escalated into a government-directed assessment of offshore financing exposure to some of the country’s largest companies.Those under scrutiny include Anbang Insurance, HNA Group, Fosun and Dalian Wanda, four of China’s most active acquirers responsible for a combined $55bn in outbound deals in recent years. “It appears to signal that Chinese companies will now need to get their offshore financing arrangements vetted when they undertake cross-border M&A deals,” says Colin Banfield, Citi’s head of M&A in Asia.But Mr Banfield sees this as a return to a more normal deal volume following the record $220bn of transactions in 2016, with other bankers expecting slower but more prudent dealmaking.Chinese companies are still on track to beat their total transaction value of 2015 — at the time, a record year. If ChemChina’s record $44bn buyout of Switzerland’s Syngenta is removed from last year’s tally, the volume of transactions so far in 2017 is just $4bn behind.""In terms of the number of deals, they are still there. The demand is still very strong for mechanical and chemicals acquisitions,” says Wang Zilong, global head of M&A at China International Capital Corporation. “But the deals are smaller this year. The dollar amount is down on last year.”Many of this year’s Chinese overseas buyouts have been pursued by large, state-backed groups that have received government clearance to buy assets overseas. The largest so far has been sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation’s €12.3bn takeover of UK-based logistics company Logicor from Blackstone in June. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party — a key political meeting scheduled for the end of the year — could also be slowing some deals at state-owned enterprises. “This could have some implications for [state-owned enterprises] because there could be some changes to policy,” says Zhu Hansong, chief executive of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities. “But we don't see too many private companies being affected by this. Demand among private companies is still very strong.”"

They alleged that the VCs, the bank and the Good board had contributed to the disappointing outcome by putting their own interests ahead of common stockholders.Specifically, the shareholders alleged that JPMorgan first concealed its true feelings about a spring 2015 flotation for Good and then steered a sweetheart transaction to BlackBerry to curry favour with the phonemaker.JPMorgan, the VCs and the board denied wrongdoing but opted to settle for a collective $52m, a judge confirmed on Thursday.For the Silicon Valley start-up scene, the Good blow-up and aftermath has become a cautionary tale of the governance challenges that arise after galloping valuations slow down. JPMorgan, for its part, became the latest bank to pay a price over accusations that its sprawling business interests clouded its judgment. The $52m will only ease some of the sting for the Good employees who believe their company sold for less than half the value it could have.Nationalised AIB to refloat as Irish economy recoversSeven years after it was forced to nationalise Allied Irish Banks at a ruinous cost, Ireland is to finally begin selling down its 99.9 per cent stake in the country’s second-biggest lender, in what promises to be one of the biggest IPOs on London’s main market for two decades, writes Laura Noonan.Chief executive Bernard Bryne could hardly contain his glee at the historic moment of the publication of AIB’s “Intention to Float” document, telling reporters he was “delighted” to be talking to them about the “significant step” to return the bank to private ownership.Ireland’s outgoing finance minister, Michael Noonan, was in fine fettle too. Between fees, coupons, a dividend and the redemption of some instruments, Ireland argues that it has already recouped €6.8bn of the €20.8bn it put into AIB.But nothing quite says “normalisation” like getting private owners for a bank whose rescue helped force Ireland into an EU-IMF bailout.Mr Noonan’s officials, the bank’s management, and a bevy of advisers from Deutsche Bank, Davy’s and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have already met with close to 20 potential investors to test interest. They report positive soundings, against a backdrop of Ireland’s enviable economic growth and the bank’s three year run of pre-tax profits.The price range — which will be announced around June 13 — will show how confident Dublin and its advisers really feel about the apparent interest. AIB’s book value was €11.3bn at the end of last year, they’ll be hoping to get a market valuation of at least that, anything less would look like failure in the eyes of Ireland’s watchful electorate.Buyers are likely to be blue-chip institutions, not the kind of white knight investors led by US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who made a killing on their investment in Bank of Ireland back in 2011.Irish retail investors can also participate, but only if they spend at least €10,000, a mechanism designed to prevent the kind of mass outrage that came after Irish telecom Eircom dramatically flopped after its IPO in 1999.CVC sets a new European fundraising record of €16bnCVC Capital Partners, the Luxembourg-based buyout group, attracted €16bn for its latest private equity fund, the largest to be raised by a European group, writes Javier Espinoza.The record raising was taken as a further sign of support for fund managers who can boost returns in a low-yield environment. Private equity groups have benefited from a buoyant environment as large institutional investors have sought to back the top-performing managers.CVC, the group behind the takeovers of Formula One and Breitling watches, raised €16bn, but could have raised more after receiving interest for nearly double the amount. The fund manager added its own money to a fundraising limit of €15.5bn.CVC has raised almost $107bn since its formation in 1981 as an offshoot of Citigroup.The company brought in new investors from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Existing investors have increased their commitment, according to a person familiar with the fundraising.Demand for high performing private equity funds has meant that some managers have changed terms on their funds, which some regard as more favourable to buyout groups. In the case of CVC, it tightened the terms by cutting the hurdle rate for its fees and ditching early-bird discounts.The fund will invest over a five-year period and out of 14 countries in Europe. CVC has spent close to 80 per cent from its previous fund, raised in 2013, and expects to make the first acquisition with the new fund next year.● Lombard: Buyout fund investors must get over their ‘FoMo’Dulux owner Akzo refuses to be rolled over by PPGPPG Industries walked away from its €27bn takeover offer for Akzo Nobel, owner of Dulux, ending a three-month clash between two of the world’s largest paints and coatings companies, writes Michael Pooler.Despite threats that it would take its offer directly to Akzo shareholders, the Pittsburgh-based group eventually chose to withdraw the offer for its Dutch rival.The retreat means that PPG, led by chief executive Michael McGarry, faces a six-month ‘cooling off’ period, during which it cannot make further bids for Akzo under Dutch takeover rules.A combination of the two companies would have created a dominant player in the $130bn global paints and coatings market, at a time of ferocious consolidation in the chemicals industry.Akzo rejected three cash-and-stock offers since March, the latest valuing its shares at €96.75 each — a 50 per cent premium to the stock’s undisturbed price.Several of its shareholders, led by the activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors, had urged it to go to the negotiating table.The defence represents a victory for Akzo Nobel’s chief executive Ton Büchner, who argued that PPG’s bids undervalued the company and would lead to significant redundancies.Akzo said it would continue to create two businesses: one focused on paints and coatings, and the other on speciality chemicals.It is the latest example of one of America’s largest companies being rebuffed by a European company, highlighting the political difficulty of securing a cross-border takeover without the co-operation of the target.● Lex: PPG-Akzo — cold war
● Due Diligence: Another US buyer falls shortBarclays sells out of Africa as multiyear rejig concludesThe multiyear overhaul of Barclays is almost complete, declared its chief executive, Jes Staley, after the bank agreed to offload most of its African operations this week, writes Martin Arnold.“We are done restructuring,” said Mr Staley. “What that does to employee morale and in terms of aligning the company’s interests with shareholders’ interests is really significant. This is going to be a seminal change at this bank.”Barclays cited strong investor demand for its decision to sell a bigger stake than expected in its main African operation, giving up control of the Johannesburg-listed business by cutting its holding from 50 per cent to 15 per cent.In a separate deal, the UK bank ended its 105-year presence in Zimbabwe by agreeing to sell its operations in the cash-starved African country to First Merchant Bank, a Malawi-listed lender.The disposal, announced on Friday, is being contested by Barclays staff in Zimbabwe, who have appealed to the country’s high court to block the transaction.Selling out of Africa was one of the major decisions by Mr Staley after he became Barclays’ chief executive 18 months ago. He is seeking to boost the bank’s capital and shrink its geographical presence back to its main US and UK markets.Barclays is also preparing to close the non-core unit it set up three years ago to offload £400bn of unwanted assets, including its Africa business.A hiring freeze helped to cut staff numbers from 142,000 to 82,600 and was lifted only recently.● Lex: Barclays — payout of Africa"
13;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-06-02T04:02:37Z;EuroTrip: Another US buyer falls short;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;Forget popping bottles of champagne, ice cream was the delicacy of choice for Akzo Nobel chief executive Ton Büchner (see tweet below) on Thursday. The Dutch executive had cause for celebration: Akzo had successfully fended off the unwanted advances of its US suitor PPG Industries, which withdrew its €27bn takeover offer for the Dutch paints company after a three-month long pursuit. Story here.That makes PPG the latest big US company to fail at trying to win over a large European rival, despite a multi-month struggle. The defeat puts PPG in good company, joining a list that includes Kraft Heinz, Pfizer and Monsanto — all of whom were unsuccessful at striking a friendly deal in the old continent. To learn more about PPG’s defeat, read this FT analysis and this note from our friends on Lex. One thing was clear from the start of PPG’s pursuit: the battle was lost due to miscalculations in its first approach in March, which came just days before the Dutch elections and was received poorly by Büchner. DD asked some top US corporate lawyers to weigh in on why sophisticated American acquirers stumble so often in Europe.Frank Aquila, partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, says: “While US boards of directors are focused on shareholder value, European supervisory boards, that include labour union representatives, do not agree to deals simply on the basis of shareholder value. This leads to misunderstandings and frustration.”He also adds that takeover rules in the US are generally the same whether you are acquiring a Delaware corporation or a California corporation. “US boards and executives expect similar rules when acquiring companies outside the US. When they encounter a wholly different approach to corporate combinations, it is corporate culture shock writ large.”That may explain the smile on Büchner’s face above.This is Due Diligence — the FT’s premium briefing on deals and the business of dealmaking.

We’d love to hear your thoughts on DD and on deals: Due.Diligence@ft.comThe fun part of writing deal engagement letters for bankers: setting the fees clients will owe. The painful part: everything else.That’s why there are lawyers. On Thursday, the FT broke the story that JPMorgan would settle with the shareholders of the fallen unicorn Good Technology for $35m. Good was once worth more than $1bn. It sold to BlackBerry for just $425m in 2015.The common shareholders of Good were, naturally, unhappy. Their lawyers would eventually find a series of internal emails that they said indicated that the board was paralysed by conflicts that came from its preferred stock so it couldn’t execute its duties to common shareholders. At the same time, the common shareholders allege that JPMorgan was deviously pushing a sale to BlackBerry over better options because it wanted future business from the smartphone pioneer.With a trial set to start on Monday, the VC defendants settled last week (for $17m). Interestingly, JPMorgan objected to the settlement at the time. It said its engagement letter had an “all for one, one for all clause” that prevented other defendants in litigation from settling without their consent.The Delaware court rejected the argument. But the “all for one clause” is now in the spotlight. It’s a provision that came out of the seminal RBC decision a few years ago where the Canadian bank paid a $100m judgment after being found liable for steering the sale of its client Rural/Metro to a favoured buyer.The Rural/Metro board and another banker, Moelis, had settled before trial, leaving RBC all alone. The idea of the legal provision now is to avoid a situation where one party sits by itself at trial.But as JPMorgan found out, engagement letters are contracts between companies and banks. A company’s board members or venture capital backers are free to enter into whatever settlement arrangements they want. Leave the loyalty to the Three Musketeers.A private equity consortium including Bob Marley’s youngest son bought Trans-High Corporation (THC, if you’re hip) for $70m.The group — including Oreva Capital and Damian “Jr Gong” Marley — now owns High Times magazine, the 42-year-old chronicler of all things chronic, the Cannabis Cup competitions (think the Chelsea Flower Show, but mellower) and the greatest media softball team in history. It will operate as High Times Holding Company.Adam Levin, the Oreva founder who will act as chief executive during the restructuring, told DD that the acquisition allowed the investors to get involved in an industry “with more low-hanging fruit than in any other industry . . . without going near the plant”, which involves a host of regulatory and legal issues.He said he sees High Times as a lifestyle brand and is working to build out its events and branding businesses — think vaporisers or dispensaries. He compared the business to Cigar Aficionado or Wine Spectator magazines.Marley is carving out a mini-marijuana empire for himself, with a stake in a retail dispensary in Colorado and plans to convert a former California prison into a massive marijuana manufacturing plant.Other investors in the deal include James Curnin, the Le Parker Meridien hotel heir, venture capitalist Brian Kessler, and James Bailey, whose father co-founded Cambridge Associates.The magazine has ridden a legal high as various forms of marijuana legalisation have come to states across the US. But the new US attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, has argued — against all scientific evidence — that marijuana is “only slightly less awful” than heroin, and has vowed to use his office as the nation’s top law enforcement officer to supersede state legalisation laws (though Congress has so far stymied his efforts).Per Levin: “We’ve weathered many other storms throughout the fight of legalisation and we’ll weather many more, continuing through the current administration.”Investors, meanwhile, are feeling a contact high from America’s neighbours to the north, where the potential full legalisation of weed may be coming soon: this week Canada’s MedReleaf Corp pulled off the largest IPO for a medical marijuana producer in North America, raising C$100m ($75m).High times, indeed.Houlihan Lokey, the New York-based investment bank, has hired Tom Olivier as TMT managing director.

One could say a similar dynamic has appeared across boardrooms too. On Thursday, PPG Industries abandoned its €27bn pursuit of paint rival, Akzo Nobel. The scuttled tie-up comes close on the heels of Kraft Heinz’s decision to ditch its pursuit of the Dutch/UK consumer group, Unilever.But the data tells a different story. Cross-border M&A between the US and Europe so far this year is at decade highs. Major tie-ups go in both directions. Reckitt Benckiser of the UK is buying Mead Johnson for $18bn. Johnson & Johnson is taking out Actelion for $29bn. Big, mature companies are making big, mature decisions to accelerate growth.Thomson Reuters data shows that the $172bn in US and European mergers through May is the highest total in that period in over a decade. Whatever political wobbles still exist, the European economies and financial systems have stabilised. For Americans flush with cash and seeking new avenues, Europe looks tasty.Akzo and Unilever made all the right noises about seeking real long-term value on their own. Their governments did their respective duties to discourage the foreign interlopers.Most analysts doubted Akzo’s ability to achieve a market valuation similar to what PPG was offering, even if Akzo spun off some of its businesses. Give PPG credit, though, it showed the verve to push Akzo for nearly three months, Kraft Heinz gave up within hours of Unilever’s rejection.It is unclear what else PPG could have done to break Akzo’s resistance. Even the protestations of Akzo shareholder Elliott Management were not enough. PPG should walk away rather than just keep bidding against itself. But regrettably, no equally attractive asset awaits on the horizon. At some point Akzo may see the folly of its ways and show more respect for its shareholders.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
15;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-06-01T16:56:33Z;Ex-wrestler McGarry fails to make Akzo submit;PPG chief outmanoeuvred by Dutch rival Büchner in bitter €26.9bn takeover tussle;"As a former high-school wrestler, Michael McGarry knows a thing or two about pinning down opponents into submission.Yet for all his muscular efforts over the past three months, the chief executive of PPG Industries, the US paints and coatings group, was outmanoeuvred by Dutch rival Akzo Nobel in their €26.9bn takeover tussle.PPG has been forced to relinquish its pursuit of the owner of the Dulux brand and cannot return for at least six months under Dutch takeover rules after deciding against taking its third offer directly to Akzo shareholders.The decision marks an anticlimactic denouement to what had become a bitter transatlantic battle over one of Europe’s oldest companies, with roots dating back to 1792.Akzo’s rejection of three unsolicited cash-and-stock bids since March had set up the possibility of PPG launching a hostile approach.The retreat leaves PPG bereft of a large acquisition target it had long coveted and means Mr McGarry must now find other ways to expand the Pittsburgh-based company.“He’s going to have to go down a path that’s more incremental and doesn’t necessarily have the same potential shareholder return,” says Graham Copley of investment research firm SSR.Although it came during a spree of consolidation that is reshaping both the $130bn global paints and coatings market and the wider chemicals industry, the timing of Mr McGarry’s approach appeared flawed.The first bid, delivered during an informal meeting with his counterpart Ton Büchner, came less than two weeks before elections in the Netherlands.A political backlash against the proposed deal ensued, as tweets sent out by Akzo with the hashtag #DutchPride tapped into a growing sentiment against foreign takeovers.But behind the scenes PPG was on a charm offensive.In the days and weeks that followed, several of Akzo’s largest investors went public to urge the company to the negotiating table, including its single largest shareholder, Causeway Capital. At one point Mr McGarry even claimed that nearly all of Akzo’s top-20 shareholders were in favour of talks.Playing the role of agitator was the activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors, known for its aggressive campaigns to influence corporate boardrooms. It accumulated a stake of more than 3 per cent and began to throw its weight around, calling for a special shareholder meeting to oust Akzo’s chairman, Antony Burgmans, who was seen as an obstacle to takeover talks.Ultimately Elliott was thwarted: a Dutch business court this week threw out its claim to force Akzo to hold the extraordinary general meeting. A request by PPG to regulators for an extension to the bid deadline also fell on deaf ears.PPG’s move on Akzo fell squarely into its transition from a diversified industrial conglomerate into a more focused company, which along with coatings and paints also supplies sealants for cars and aircraft.Mr McGarry, a company lifer who has risen through the ranks of PPG since taking his first job in 1981, has built a reputation for integrating a number of acquisitions that have helped push sales generated by paints and coatings from just over half to 97 per cent since 2005.They include the $2.3bn takeover of Mexico’s Comex in 2014 and the $3.2bn purchase of Dutch coatings maker SigmaKalon in 2008, PPG’s largest acquisition to date.Failure to land Akzo may not be fatal for the chief executive. Before PPG’s withdrawal, one person briefed on the matter said the chief executive had the backing of the company’s board.“As a CEO, I don’t think it’s really going to affect his [McGarry’s] position,” said Mr Mauricio Viaud, an analyst at Hefren-Tillotson.With anaemic rates of growth throughout much of the wider chemicals sector, PPG’s logic for the combination appeared soundly rooted in extracting benefits of scale. A merger would have created a dominant player in paints and coatings, with a widened geographic reach.“We are experts at liquid coatings technology. They [Akzo Nobel] have a very strong powder coatings technology — they are the leader in that space,” Mr McGarry told the FT in an interview last week. “Most paint customers require both liquid and powder. So when you go to a customer you’ll be able to provide a wide range of coatings to meet their requirements.”And as with many of the other big-ticket mergers in the chemicals industry, cost-cutting was a key rationale: PPG outlined potential annual savings of $750m.So important was the deal to PPG that it raised its offer to €96.75 per share — a premium of 50 per cent to Akzo’s undisturbed share price. The stock is currently trading around €74.81.With its failure to tie up a deal with Akzo, PPG may face threats from competitors such as Axalta, spun out of Dupont, which are encroaching on its mainstay of automotive coatings, say analysts.“The coatings market still remains relatively fragmented, so I do believe medium-to-long term there will be more consolidation,” said Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Advisors, an equity research firm. “In the near-term, PPG may just deploy more capital towards share buybacks and dividend boosts rather than immediately pursue another deal.”Former wrestler Mr McGarry may now find he is on the defensive rather than the attack.Mar 8 2017 PPG and Akzo reported to have held talks over possible deal

16;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-06-01T14:05:59Z;PPG ends 3-month fight to buy Dutch rival Akzo;Withdrawal of €27bn bid marks latest failure of a US group targeting Europe;"A bitter three-month takeover fight between two of the world’s largest paint and coatings companies was won by Dutch group Akzo Nobel on Thursday after American rival PPG Industries said it was abandoning its €26.9bn pursuit.Despite weeks of threats from PPG that it would take its offer directly to Akzo shareholders, the Pittsburgh-based group decided to walk away, withdrawing its takeover proposal for the maker of paints including household brand Dulux.The assault on Akzo, which was egged on by the activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors, would have created a dominant leader in the $130bn paints and coatings sector at a time when the broader chemicals industry is undergoing a ferocious round of consolidation.But Michael McGarry, the PPG chief executive who has been repeatedly rebuffed by Akzo’s leadership, said he abandoned the attempt after his latest overture went unanswered.“We made a final attempt for engagement late last week and through a letter to Akzo,” Mr McGarry said in a statement. “However, Akzo’s boards have consistently refused to engage and did not respond to our call or letter.”Shares in Akzo moved little on the decision, closing up 0.6 per cent in Amsterdam trading at €74.93, giving it a market value of €18.6bn and reflecting investors’ expectations that PPG’s advances were already doomed to failure.The unsuccessful bid also marks the latest example of one of America’s largest companies being rebuffed by a major European company, highlighting the political difficulty of securing a cross-border takeover without the co-operation of the target.Other high-profile failures include Kraft Heinz’s $143bn bid to buy Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever, Monsanto’s multiple attempts to acquire Swiss agribusiness rival Syngenta and Pfizer’s effort to buy UK pharma group AstraZeneca.Akzo said it told PPG that it had received Mr McGarry’s letter and its board was “fully evaluating” it before the withdrawal. Akzo chief executive Ton Büchner said the company would continue to focus on its own strategy of creating two businesses, paints and coatings and speciality chemicals.“We believe this will lead to a step change in growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders and all other stakeholders,” Mr Büchner said on Thursday.Fuelled by an abundance of cheap debt and an inability to grow organically, companies in the chemicals sector have used large-scale acquisitions as a way to cut costs and boost their earnings.PPG’s initial approach made by Mr McGarry in early March was immediately met with hostility by Mr Büchner. It was soon after greeted with fury from the Dutch political establishment, some of whom took to Twitter to defend the 225-year-old company using the hashtag #DutchPride. News of the bid emerged just days before national elections.However, PPG quickly found support among many top Akzo shareholders including Elliott, which holds a large stake in the business and tried to bend the Dutch company’s board into engaging with the US suitor. Elliott failed in an attempt to call a special shareholder meeting to oust Akzo chairman Antony Burgmans.The US company’s third and final offer was rejected in May. It valued Akzo at €26.9bn including debt and the Dutch company’s shares at €96.75 each.The PPG offer comprised €61.50 in cash per share, with the remainder in PPG shares. The bid included plans to pay Akzo’s normal dividend as well as a special dividend that the Dutch company promised shareholders as part of its own standalone plan to spin off its specialty chemicals business.We believe this will lead to a step change in growth and long-term value creation for our shareholders and all other stakeholdersPPG’s previous cash-and-stock offers of €83 and €90 a share were rejected.In addition to the value of the offer, Mr Büchner has argued that the PPG offer failed to address stakeholder concerns and the prospects of a lengthy antitrust review.In recent weeks, however, many investors have told the Financial Times they disagree with Mr Büchner’s approach and the board’s near-refusal to engage with its US suitor in a constructive manner. “I think Akzo has bigger challenges ahead than PPG to justify its current share price,” said Graham Copley of SSR, the investment research firm.Under takeover rules in the Netherlands, PPG faces a six-month “cooling off” period, during which it cannot make further bids for Akzo. The company had tried to get a June 1 deadline extended, but the request was struck down this week by a Dutch court, which also threw out a case brought by Elliott to oust Mr Burgmans.Additional reporting by Mehreen KhanMar 8 2017 PPG and Akzo reported to have held talks over possible deal

Going down that route would involve taking a hostile takeover bid directly to the target company’s shareholders.The decision marks the second setback in as many days for PPG in its pursuit of Akzo Nobel. On Monday, the Amsterdam Enterprise Chamber threw out a case brought by Elliott, the activist hedge fund, which was seeking to oust Akzo’s chairman as part of efforts to force the company to the negotiating table with its suitor.
19;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-05-30T11:19:54Z;Hunt for earnings growth reshapes chemicals sector;Wave of deals across the diverse industry is being spurred by chance to cut costs;From cosmetics ingredients to pillow foam, and from paints to crop sprays, a chain reaction of deals is coursing through an industry that makes many of the world’s everyday products as well as key materials that go into them.The list of large transactions that has spread through the chemicals sector expanded just last week, with the proposed merger between Switzerland’s Clariant and Huntsman Corporation of the US.The combined group — valued at $20bn including debt — would aim to become a leader in the area of speciality chemicals, with products ranging from industrial adhesives to colourants for lipstick.It follows a succession of blockbuster deals, which kicked off 18 months ago with a transaction involving the two largest chemicals companies in the US: Dow Chemical’s agreed $69bn takeover of DuPont.Deals to buy chemicals groups that were either announced or completed in 2016 had an aggregate value of $263.7bn including debt, according to data provider Dealogic, compared with $177.4bn in 2015, when the figures were dominated by the Dow-DuPont transaction.This slew of dealmaking is reshaping a hugely diverse sector that has struggled with weak demand due to the lacklustre economic recovery since the global financial crisis.“Fundamentally it’s very difficult for chemicals companies to grow faster than [gross domestic product], except in niches,” says Kirk McIntosh, partner at the Valence Group, a specialist investment bank.With limited prospects for revenue growth, chemicals companies are looking to boost earnings by buying rivals and stripping out costs. The enlarged groups are also seeking increased market power that would enable them to strike better contracts with suppliers and customers.These motivations are apparent in two of the three recent agri-business megadeals, where chemicals groups are responding to a downturn in the farming industry that stems from a plunge in crop prices following years of bumper harvests.After Dow and DuPont unveiled their merger in December 2015 following pressure from activist investors to cut costs, state-controlled ChemChina proposed a $43bn takeover of Switzerland’s Syngenta in February 2016, and six months later Germany’s Bayer agreed to buy Monsanto of the US for $66bn.These transactions are aimed at beefing up the capabilities of the enlarged groups to help feed the world’s growing population — all three will have strong product portfolios involving both seeds and crop sprays.But while ChemChina pledged to support Syngenta’s existing operations, in a recognition of the political sensitivities surrounding the deal, by contrast Dow and Bayer have sought to persuade investors of the merits of their transactions partly by outlining plans to cut costs.And this drive to reduce expenses and gain economies of scale has rippled out to other parts of the chemicals industry.In March 2016 Sherwin-Williams, a leading US paint maker, agreed to pay $11.3bn for domestic rival Valspar, and highlighted opportunities to trim overheads.One year later PPG Industries, the US manufacturer of coatings and sealants for aircraft and cars, made the first of three offers for Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paintmaker that owns the Dulux brand. Akzo has rejected the offers, but is coming under pressure to engage in talks from shareholders led by Elliott Advisors, the UK offshoot of the New York-based activist hedge fund.Activist investors are not the only disruptive force affecting western chemicals companies. Another is the rise of rivals in China.The extent of China’s ambitions in chemicals became plain when ChemChina swooped on Syngenta — it ranks as the country’s largest proposed overseas takeover.Bankers say an expected merger between ChemChina and state-controlled Sinochem, which would create the world’s largest chemicals group by revenue, is aimed at giving the former company the financial capacity to absorb Syngenta.But even before the Syngenta deal, China was shaking up the chemicals industry. In certain products — notably bulk chemicals such as caustic soda — China has turned from a net importer to an exporter, says Graham Copley of SSR, an investment research firm.This has put downward pressure on the prices of many commodity chemicals, and therefore served as a further spur to industry consolidation.Another deal driver appears to be the tricky position that chemicals companies occupy in industrial supply chains.Hemmed in between gargantuan suppliers of natural resources — often oil and gas groups — on one side, and large customers in sectors such as automotive, consumer goods and pharmaceuticals on the other, chemicals producers can find themselves squeezed.“This is an effort by the chemicals industry in its entirety to match up the level of consolidation of their customers and suppliers,” says Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Advisors, an equity research firm. “Because of [greater] heft, you can negotiate better sourcing deals.”Furthest down this path are chemicals companies producing industrial gases, an industry subsector that has been consolidating over the past two decades. It took another major step with the $70bn merger finalised last week between Germany’s Linde and Praxair of the US.The enlarged group will supply industrial gases used in steel and glass production, among other things.However, not all the chiefs of the chemicals companies engaged in deals are seeking to build empires — some are instead trying to dismantle sprawling groups that have been accused of lacking focus.This was encapsulated by Dow and DuPont’s original merger agreement, which envisaged the combined group subsequently splitting into three discrete companies: one concentrating on seeds and crop sprays, another on materials such as plastics, and a third on speciality chemicals.This month, Dow and DuPont said the break-up plan would be reviewed, amid investor concern it was not correctly configured. Dan Loeb’s Third Point, the activist hedge fund that called for a break-up of Dow back in 2014, said the enlarged group should be split into six companies to maximise shareholder value.Akzo, meanwhile, is trying to fend off PPG’s interest by proposing to spin off its specialty chemicals business.Since many of the big deals in the chemicals industry are being investigated by antitrust regulators, there is likely to be a second wave of transactions stemming from divestments required to safeguard competition.“There’s this aftermath of big mergers we’re going to see,” says one banker involved in the sector.Unlike some of the other large chemicals deals announced over the past 18 months, simplicity does not appear to be at the heart of the proposed merger between Clariant and Huntsman.With little overlap in their product portfolios and no crossover in their manufacturing operations, the companies say their businesses are “complementary” and so no factory closures are proposed.Instead, they intend to extract $400m of annual cost savings by cutting back-office functions as well as procurement and logistics overheads.However, the wide array of speciality chemicals that the combined group would have has led some analysts to question the logic of the deal.“Given the lack of business [and] product overlap, the companies run the risk of taking two businesses in a variety of hard to understand . . . markets and simply making something more complex,” says Graham Copley of SSR, an investment research firm.One concern is the risk of a so-called “conglomerate discount” in the combined group’s share price. This refers to the tendency of investors to undervalue diversified companies compared with those operating in a single area.“HuntsmanClariant will be a larger, more complex conglomerate,” say Nomura analysts. “Investors tend to prefer simpler, pure-play companies.”Nevertheless, Clariant and Huntsman are hoping to boost revenue by cross-selling each other’s products to their respective customers.Hariolf Kottmann, Clariant chief executive, said: “With a broader diversified portfolio HuntsmanClariant can better balance the inherent fluctuations in certain specialty product segments. By combining the strengths of both companies we can innovate faster and more effectively in speciality products and scale faster in joint growth areas.”Peter Huntsman, chief executive of Huntsman, added: “While we acknowledge there is a recent trend toward smaller simpler specialty chemical companies in the US equity markets, we believe over time it will be consistent earnings growth that will ultimately be rewarded driven by higher top-line growth and lower costs.”Support for the all-stock merger of equals has been secured from the Huntsman family, which is the single largest shareholder in the eponymous group with a 15 per cent stake. A group of Bavarian investors has agreed to lock up their 14 per cent holding in Clariant for 18 months to help smooth the deal.But the reception in the stock markets suggests other investors are yet to be convinced. Shares in Huntsman and Clariant are both trading below their level before the merger was unveiled.

Elliott, controlled by billionaire Paul Singer, is known for its aggressive campaigning to influence corporate boards.In a ruling on Monday night Gijs Makkink, president of the Amsterdam court, said Akzo was not obliged to involve shareholders in its decisions regarding the PPG bid and was not required to start talks.The ruling dismisses all the requests of Elliott. Akzo Nobel will continue to have a constructive dialogue with its shareholdersStill, the ruling said a lack of confidence among a substantial group of shareholders in the company’s strategy was detrimental to Akzo and all its stakeholders. Akzo’s board and management should find a way to normalise relations with shareholders, the judge said.Akzo said it was “very pleased that the Enterprise Chamber has decided that [it had] acted in accordance with the highest standards of Dutch corporate governance”, and endorsed Mr Burgmans’ position and actions.“The ruling dismisses all the requests of Elliott. Akzo Nobel will continue to have a constructive dialogue with its shareholders,” the company said.The case raises the prospect of a hostile bid by PPG, in what has become a bitter transatlantic tussle over one of Europe’s oldest industrial concerns. A combination of Akzo with PPG would create a leader in the $130bn global paints and coatings market, at a time of blockbuster corporate mergers and acquisitions sweeping through the wider chemicals industry.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningPPG’s board is scheduled to meet on Tuesday and will consider whether to walk away from its courtship of Akzo, or launch a hostile takeover attempt with a direct offer to Akzo’s shareholders.Responding to the ruling on Monday, the US company said: “PPG remains willing to meet with Akzo Nobel regarding a potential combination of the two companies but, without productive engagement, PPG will assess and decide whether or not to pursue an offer for Akzo Nobel.”Under Dutch takeover rules, PPG must submit formal bidding papers and evidence of financing to markets regulators by June 1. If it fails to do so, it faces a six-month “cooling off” period during which it cannot make further bids for Akzo. However, PPG has sought an extension of the deadline to June 14 at the earliest.Elliott had alleged that Mr Burgmans had failed in his duty to investors by refusing to engage in meaningful talks with PPG and rebuffing its three takeover offers, the latest amounting to about $29.5bn. The fund, which has a 3 per cent stake in Akzo, asked the court to direct Akzo to allow a vote on the chairman’s removal, a demand that was backed by investors controlling 13 per cent of its stock.Akzo has argued that PPG’s offers were not in the best interest of all stakeholders. In April the business proposed an alternative plan of returning €1.6bn to investors and spinning off its speciality chemicals unit within a year. Such a move would leave the company focused on paints and coatings.Michael McGarry, chief executive of PPG, has told the Financial Times that investors representing more than a quarter of Akzo stock were in favour of the proposed takeover.“We’ve always said our preferred pathway is a friendly, consensual deal negotiated privately,” he said. “It’s clear to us this is no longer about value.”

But Akzo Nobel’s steadfast position has sparked a chorus of investor dissent, with a number of shareholders, led by the hedge fund Elliott Advisors, publicly urging it to the negotiating table.This has set up the possibility of a hostile takeover bid by PPG, in what has become a bitter transatlantic tussle over one of Europe’s oldest industrial concerns. A combination of the two companies would create a leader in the $130bn global paints and coatings market, at a time of blockbuster corporate mergers and acquisitions sweeping through the wider chemicals industry.On Monday, a Dutch business court is set to rule on a case brought by Elliott against Akzo’s management. The activist investor, which has a stake above 3 per cent and is known for its aggressive campaigns to influence corporate boardrooms, is seeking to overturn Akzo’s rejection of its request for a special shareholder meeting to remove chairman Antony Burgmans, who is seen as an obstacle to talks with PPG.Elliott also wants the appointment of a new supervisory director to oversee the setting up of the requested extraordinary general meeting, at which shareholders would vote on Mr Burgman’s position. Several other shareholders are either backing Elliott’s petition to the court or variants of it. PPG’s board is then scheduled to meet on Tuesday and could decide whether to walk away from its courtship of Akzo, or launch a hostile takeover bid with a direct offer to Akzo’s shareholders. Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningUnder Dutch takeover rules, PPG must submit formal bidding papers along with evidence of financing by Thursday June 1 to the financial markets regulator AFM for review. Otherwise it faces a six-month “cooling off” period during which it cannot make further takeover attempts for Akzo. The US group has requested an extension of the deadline to June 14 at the earliest. Michael McGarry, chief executive of PPG, told the FT that shareholders representing more than a quarter of Akzo Nobel’s stock were in favour of the proposed takeover, including all its top-20 shareholders. “We’ve always said our preferred pathway is a friendly, consensual deal negotiated privately,” he said. “It’s clear to us this is no longer about value.”To shore up the support of its shareholders, Akzo Nobel has unveiled €1.6bn in dividend payments and a standalone plan that involves the separation of its speciality chemicals division, which would leave a company focused on paints and coatings. The episode has triggered a political backlash in the Netherlands, where the government is considering a new law to give publicly listed companies greater protection against foreign takeovers. Akzo Nobel and Elliott declined to comment.

Despite repeated calls from major shareholders to engage with PPG, the Akzo board argues that the offer fails to address a number of concerns including value and the impact for its workers.Elliott on Tuesday said it had filed a suit with Amsterdam’s Enterprise Chamber to ask a judge to order an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to debate the removal of Mr Burgmans.Under Dutch law, any shareholder with a 10 per cent stake can ask the company to call an extraordinary meeting. Elliott has 3.25 per cent but has recruited support from a group of institutional investors to seek such a meeting, but Akzo has declined its request.Akzo has expressed support for Mr Burgmans and argued a general meeting would not be in the company’s best interests.However, in its letter Elliott said not a single shareholder had publicly backed the Akzo board’s “standalone strategy and stance of non-engagement, while eight out of the 20 largest shareholders have publicly urged Akzo Nobel to constructively engage with PPG”.Corporate governance experts say the chances of a successful hostile bid by PPG are slim.Akzo has a unique, decades-old, Dutch anti-takeover defence that makes it practically impossible for shareholders to overthrow the company’s board and install directors who would favour a deal.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on dealsThis is a foundation consisting of four Akzo directors who hold 48 priority shares in the group, and have the right to use this stock to make binding nominations to the management and supervisory boards in any situation where the independent body deems the interests of the company and its stakeholders to be at risk.The foundation’s priority shares were introduced in 1926, according to people who have studied the structure closely.They said a general meeting of shareholders could not overrule these binding nominations.The possibility to challenge a binding nomination was only allowed under Dutch corporate law in 1928, but the reform allowed arrangements established before that date to remain in place.
23;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-05-08T16:18:03Z;PPG/Akzo Nobel: mending fences;It’s déjà vu all over again for Hugh Grant;Hugh Grant must be feeling an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu. As chief executive of Monsanto, he staged a long but ultimately fruitless courtship of Syngenta, the Swiss crop science group. As senior independent director at PPG Industries, he is now having a similar experience with Akzo Nobel.Frustrated by its refusal to engage, key Syngenta shareholders formed a pressure group. They were eventually placated by a bumper cash bid from ChemChina, which is set to complete next month. Akzo on Monday rejected a third bid from US rival PPG. A section of its shareholders are similarly cross. PPG may come back with a fourth offer. But it is unlikely that it will go hostile. If it gives up its pursuit, then Akzo will need to think about how to mend fences with its investors.There seems little chance of engineering a higher bid from elsewhere. Two other big players in paints and coatings, Sherwin Williams and Valspar, are already in the process of merging. A surprise Chinese bidder may yet materialise, as it did for Syngenta. But the political climate in China has turned against overseas acquisitions since that deal (hence the plan to combine ChemChina and Sinochem). And the circumstances of the rejections of the PPG bids suggest Akzo’s managers simply do not want to sell.They should be careful. At €77, Akzo’s share price remains meaningfully below the €96.75 bid price (both include €6.47 per share of dividends that Akzo has pledged to pay). It runs the risk of an AstraZeneca-like situation. The UK pharma group’s shares have never traded above the £55 a share that Pfizer wanted to offer for them in 2014.Akzo does have an alternative plan ready. It plans to sell or spin off its specialty chemicals division, which should leave a standalone coatings group trading at a higher multiple of profits, and be quicker to execute than a merger. Investors get a €1bn special dividend in the meantime. But not all are convinced this plan will ultimately create more value than a takeover.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThe face-saving solution for all would be for Akzo to proceed with the separation of the businesses. An independent coatings group would re-rate, and PPG could come back for that alone in, say, a year’s time. Investors would likely get a higher price. Akzo’s managers could say they had done their duty. PPG — and Mr Grant — would finally get their prize.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
24;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-05-08T10:08:00Z;Akzo Nobel rejects €26.9bn PPG takeover offer;Rebuff forces suitor to choose between making hostile bid or walking away;Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paints and coatings group, has rejected a €26.9bn takeover offer by its US rival PPG Industries, in a move that will force its suitor to choose between making a hostile bid or walking away.Despite significant pressure from its investors to engage with PPG, Akzo revealed its rejection two weeks after the US company submitted a third offer to create an industry leader in the $130bn paints and coatings sector.“The PPG proposal undervalues Akzo Nobel, contains significant risks and uncertainties, makes no substantive commitments to stakeholders and demonstrates a lack of cultural understanding,” said Ton Büchner, Akzo chief executive, in a statement on Monday.Akzo said that as part of its review of the third offer, Mr Büchner and chairman Antony Burgmans met PPG’s chief executive and chairman Michael McGarry and its lead director Hugh Grant on Saturday.It was the first public meeting since March when PPG made its initial bid for the Dutch company, whose brands include Dulux paints.The US company said on Monday: “PPG is disappointed that Akzo Nobel has once again refused to enter into a negotiation regarding a combination of the two companies, ignoring the best interests of its stakeholders, including long-term shareholders who overwhelmingly support engagement.”It confirmed that the four men met over the weekend, adding that Akzo only gave PPG less than 24 hours’ notice and stipulated that the meeting would have to be in Rotterdam the following day. At the meeting, the Akzo leadership stated that they did not intend or have the authority to negotiate with PPG.Mr Büchner told the Financial Times: “We have engaged in the form of the meeting that took place on Saturday. It was the first meeting since March 2. Overall, for us, it was a respectful and cordial meeting . . . We went in there with an open mind. We had a thought there would be additional commitments . . . and we didn’t get that as part of the meeting. Therefore, we took the things we heard into consideration.”The rebuff is likely to further enrage some of Akzo’s largest shareholders, who have been uncharacteristically vocal in their contempt for the company’s handling of the PPG bids. Elliott Advisors, the European arm of the US hedge fund and one of Akzo’s top-five shareholders, has gone so far as to call for a vote to overthrow Mr Burgmans over his refusal to engage in talks with PPG.Many of Akzo’s top 20 shareholders have called on the company, either publicly or in private, to enter talks.PPG previously characterised its latest cash-and-stock bid as its last friendly offer for the company and has not ruled out taking it directly to shareholders as a hostile bid.The latest offer valued shares in Akzo at €96.75 each. It included plans to pay Akzo’s normal dividend as well as a special dividend that the Dutch company promised shareholders last month as part of a standalone plan that would see it spin off its specialty chemicals business.The PPG offer comprised €61.50 in cash per share, with the remainder in PPG shares, valuing Akzo’s equity at €24.6bn at the time it was made. PPG’s previous cash-and-stock offers of €83 and €90 were rejected.Shares in Akzo lost 3.2 per cent to €76.85 on Monday, continuing to trade at a deep discount to PPG’s latest offer. Akzo has consistently resisted PPG’s pursuit, claiming that the takeover proposals fell short in terms of its expectations for Akzo shareholders as well as the probability that a deal would face lengthy antitrust review. Akzo has found support from its workers and from the Dutch government. In its latest offer, PPG included a 14-page letter in which it attempted to appeal to Akzo shareholders, making certain commitments on jobs and also offering to agree to pay a substantial break fee once it is able to conduct due diligence.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningAhead of Monday’s bid rejection, Los Angeles-based Causeway Capital Management, which owns roughly 6.7 per cent of Akzo, added itself to the list of large shareholders calling on the Dutch company to engage with PPG. It also expressed disappointment in Akzo’s decision to reject Elliott’s request for a special shareholders’ meeting to vote on the chairman.“PPG’s most recent proposal is both thorough and addresses all stakeholders. We believe that our clients in aggregate represent one of the largest shareholdings in Akzo, and we find it incomprehensible that Akzo’s management has yet to engage with PPG.”PPG faces a deadline of June 1 to table a firm bid under the rules guiding Dutch takeovers.

The meeting lasted less than 90 minutes and the AkzoNobel chairs stated at the beginning that the meeting was solely for the purpose of reviewing PPG’s revised proposal. Specifically, the AkzoNobel chairs stated up front that they did not have the intent nor the authority to negotiate. They also did not share any concerns regarding PPG’s proposal, or analysis or comparison of their new standalone strategy versus PPG’s proposal, nor would they entertain any questions or discussion about their plan or analysis.PPG continues to believe its proposal is vastly superior in shareholder value creation and provides more certainty to employees and pensioners than AkzoNobel’s recently announced new standalone plan. PPG’s proposal represents a 50 percent premium over AkzoNobel’s unaffected stock price and 24 percent premium to its stock price after the announcement of its standalone plan. The failure of the AkzoNobel Boards to engage with PPG to fully evaluate and discuss PPG’s proposal reflects a continued lack of proper governance.

Given the sole agenda item [to remove Mr Burgmans], there is no legal basis for calling an EGM,” it added.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningElliott slammed the rejection as “groundless” and “an egregious dismissal of shareholder rights”, saying it believed Akzo Nobel was “afraid” of defeat in a vote.The hedge fund added: “As far as Elliott is aware, it is unprecedented in European corporate history to have several large shareholders request the convocation of an EGM of a major corporate, and the fact that six Akzo Nobel shareholders have done so in this instance is indicative of the breadth and depth of shareholder discontent”.The rejection is the latest twist in what has become a bitter transatlantic tussle over the fate of one of Europe’s oldest industrial concerns.Akzo Nobel, which owns the Dulux brand of paints, has already knocked back two takeover proposals from PPG. It argued they undervalued the company, risked a lengthy antitrust review and would lead to substantial job losses.Given the sole agenda item [to remove Antony Burgmans], there is no legal basis for calling an EGMHowever this has stirred dissent among Akzo’s own investors, heaping pressure on chief executive Ton Büchner. Shareholders owning roughly 17 per cent of the stock have urged it to the negotiating table.PPG raised the tempo on Monday by tabling an improved third takeover bid, which it said was its “last” friendly overture before it would take hostile action. The increased cash-and-stock offer is worth €96.75 a share — up from a prior bid of €90 and a premium of 50 per cent to Akzo’s undisturbed share price.The latest offer consists of €61.50 in cash, the remainder in PPG shares, and includes the payment of Akzo’s dividend. It values the Dutch company’s equity at €24.6bn. Akzo Nobel has said it will “carefully consider and review” the bid.Last week Akzo unveiled €1.6bn in dividend payments and gave more details on a planned separation of its speciality chemicals unit, which will leave a business focused on paints and coatings.Elliott, which holds a roughly 3 per cent stake, has criticised Akzo Nobel’s approach to corporate governance in its handling of the situation.

It values the Dutch company’s equity at €24.6bn.PPG’s previous cash-and-stock offers of €83 and €90 were rejected, prompting several investors including activist hedge fund Elliott to demand for Akzo to enter takeover talks.Elliott repeated its call to Akzo to enter negotiations, noting the language of PPG’s offer. It said: “We understand from this that PPG will make no further attempts to engage in friendly discussions.”Akzo said in a statement that it was reviewing the latest offer. The company is preparing for its annual general meeting, which is set for Tuesday. Last week, Akzo increased its financial targets and provided details on plans to hive off the speciality chemicals division, which analysts value at between €8bn and €12bn.Mr McGarry said he would be “delighted” to legally enshrine the commitments that PPG had made around factories and jobs.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningAlthough PPG promised that no Akzo Nobel employee working in a Netherlands speciality chemicals plant would lose their job as a result of the combination, he declined to extend the commitment to workers in Akzo’s paints and coatings units on the grounds it would be “inappropriate” ahead of any regulatory settlement with the European Commission.Attached to PPG’s latest bid were pledges to maintain Akzo Nobel’s strong ties to the Netherlands, including a commitment not to relocate any of its production facilities in Europe to the US, maintain its research and development investment and create a dual-listed company between the two countries.Elliott has called for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to consider the removal of Mr Burgmans, but Akzo has a unique, decades-old, Dutch anti-takeover defence that makes it practically impossible for shareholders to overthrow the company’s board and install directors who would favour a deal.Shares in Akzo Nobel rose 4.8 per cent to €81.93, giving the company a market capitalisation of €20.7bn.
29;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-04-19T10:20:55Z;Elliott turns the screw on Akzo Nobel in PPG takeover battle;Hedge fund dismisses Dutch chemical company’s latest attempt to fend off US group;Activist hedge fund manager Elliott turned the screw on Akzo Nobel just hours after the Dutch paintmaker unveiled a €1.6bn dividend payout to shareholders as part of efforts to ward off a €22.4bn takeover offensive by a bigger US rival.The owner of the Dulux brand has come under pressure from a band of investors, led by Elliott, to enter into talks with PPG Industries, from whom it has rejected two unsolicited bids since March.In an attempt to win over its shareholders, Akzo on Wednesday said it would distribute €1bn through a one-off special dividend and increase its regular payout by 50 per cent, a cash return totalling €1.6bn.It also pledged to complete a planned break-up of the company within a year by separating its speciality chemicals business, and at the same time upgraded its medium-term profit targets.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningBut this was not enough to placate Elliott, which dismissed the strategic review as “incomplete” and reiterated a threat to use the Dutch courts should Akzo decline its request for a special shareholder meeting to oust the company’s chairman.Elliott’s swift riposte highlighted the pressure on Akzo’s chief executive Ton Büchner, in what has become a bitter Transatlantic tussle over one of Europe’s oldest industrial concerns.The activist investor, which has built a reputation on aggressive campaigns to influence corporate boardrooms, said that Akzo Nobel was not in a position to evaluate its own plan against a transaction with PPG since it had not engaged with its suitor.It argued that Akzo Nobel’s board was “failing in [its] corporate governance duties” by not presenting a comparison of the two options.John Bennett of Henderson Global Investors, a top-20 shareholder in Akzo, said: “All their suddenly discovered value-enhancing tools have been displayed but they should still engage with PPG.”However, Mr Büchner insisted that his team had deemed PPG’s bids “inadequate” after “very detailed analysis”.Akzo rebuffed the offers on the grounds that they undervalued the company and its prospects, would lead to substantial job losses and require significant divestitures to appease antitrust regulators, making any deal uncertain. Its plan to hive off the speciality chemicals division, which makes everything from salt to bleaching agents and is valued by analysts at between €8bn and €12bn, would leave a business focused on paints and industrial coatings.A “dual-track” process was under way, with a separate listed entity or a sale under consideration, said Akzo, and most of the proceeds would be returned to shareholders.We believe this plan creates superior value, it’s following a clear timeline, it has a timing advantage and significantly less uncertainty [than the PPG bid]“We will create two leading customer-focused businesses that will deliver enhanced value for all of our stakeholders,” Mr Büchner said. “We believe this plan creates superior value, it’s following a clear timeline, it has a timing advantage and significantly less uncertainty [than the PPG bid].”However, there was some scepticism about its increased financial targets for the two new arms of the group.Jeremy Redenius, analyst at Bernstein, said that these amounted to an effective group-wide return on sales of 14 per cent by 2020, up 3 percentage points versus a previous target for 2018.This would be a “huge stretch”, he said. “They will have a huge challenge . . . to show how they get there,” Mr Redenius added. In addition, Akzo said that core earnings would be about €100m higher this year, because of “significant growth momentum” across all business areas. That would represent a 6.7 per cent increase to 2016’s €1.5bn in earnings before interest and tax, removing one-off items. The company posted a 13 per cent rise in adjusted ebit to €376m in the first quarter of 2017, on revenue up 7 per cent to €3.6bn.
30;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-04-19T05:38:05Z;Akzo Nobel foresees core earnings €100m higher in 2017;;Akzo Nobel said it expects core earnings to be €100m higher in 2017, as the Dutch paints and chemicals group posted record profitability in the first quarter of the year.The owner of the Dulux brand, which is attempting to fend off a €22.4bn takeover assault by US rival PPG Industries, posted a 13 per cent increase in earnings before interest and tax – excluding one-off items – to €376m in the three months ending 31 March.It put this down to “volume growth, continuous improvement and cost discipline”. The company added that this measure of earnings should be €100m greater than the €1.5bn delivered in 2016, barring any “substantial changes” in market conditions, which would represent a 6.7 per cent increase.The company said on an investor call this would put them on the “high side” of their earnings before interest and tax guidance.Akzo Nobel will be hoping that the update sets a positive tone before it unveils a new strategy to investors this morning. Management must convince shareholders that its future lies as an independent company rather than in a combination with PPG.A number of shareholders – led by the activist hedge fund Elliott – have called for Akzo Nobel to enter talks with its suitor, though the Amsterdam-based group has so far resisted.During the first quarter, Akzo Nobel’s revenue rose 7 per cent to €3.6bn, due to higher volumes and acquisitions. Return on sales hit 10.3 per cent. Sales and earnings were up in each of its divisions – decorative paints, performance coatings and speciality chemicals.
31;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-04-17T11:04:52Z;Akzo chief to rally shareholders against Elliott-backed takeover;Büchner will try to woo investors after activist hedge fund urges talks with US rival;Ton Büchner, the chief executive of besieged Akzo Nobel, will this week spell out his vision to shareholders of the Netherlands-based paintmaker as he attempts to fend off unwanted takeover advances backed by activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors.It could be a last roll of the dice for Mr Büchner as he tries to retain control of the 225-year-old business at a crunch investor meeting on Wednesday.Akzo’s bigger US rival PPG, which has launched two takeover approaches, is not giving up easily. In an open letter to Akzo’s stakeholders on Monday, the US group said its rival’s plan to remain independent was riskier and would create less value than a combination.Mr Büchner will have to convince shareholders that his management team can offer more than could be had from PPG’s bid. The rejections of PPG’s latest bid for €22.4bn has set off an increasingly bitter tussle.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThe most recent offer — €88.72 a share — was a 35 per cent premium to Akzo’s undisturbed stock price, and higher than it has ever traded.Jeremy Redenius, analyst at Bernstein Research, said Mr Büchner “has a huge challenge in front of him”.“It will be tough to reach a [share price] valuation close to PPG’s offer,” he said.Akzo argues that PPG’s bids significantly undervalued the company and its prospects and would lead to substantial job cuts, while probable divestitures on competition grounds make any deal uncertain. It has also spoken of a “culture gap” between the two companies.Yet by rebuffing its suitor, Akzo is swimming against the tide of consolidation washing over the wider chemicals sector, epitomised by the $145bn merger of Dow and DuPont.A combination of Akzo with PPG would create a dominant player in the $130bn global paints and coatings market, where larger scale can boost profits.In the Netherlands, there is political opposition to the deal. But Mr Büchner’s steadfast refusal to hear out PPG has fuelled dissent among some of his own investors.Elliott Advisors has led a chorus of shareholders — representing roughly 17 per cent of the stock — calling on Akzo to “engage” with its counterpart.“I think [Mr Büchner has] massively backed himself into a small corner,” said one top 20 shareholder, who asked that his name be withheld. “He’s hung his entire future and career now on coming out with a message on April 19 that he can deliver more value than the alternative”.Notorious for its aggressive campaigns to influence corporate boardrooms, Elliott has also requested a special shareholder meeting proposing the dismissal of Akzo’s chairman, Antony Burgmans.However, Akzo is backing Mr Burgmans and has ruled out making comparison with PPG’s bid when it unveils its new strategy.In his favour, Mr Büchner is widely credited with turning Akzo into a leaner and more profitable proposition during his five years at the helm. Plans are also in place to plug a pension black hole that was inherited with ICI.But revenue growth has proved difficult, while the company’s share price trades at a valuation below many of its peers — a factor that many analysts say probably contributed to PPG’s approach.Shareholders will expect to hear more about Akzo’s plans to separate out its speciality chemicals business, which supplies everything from salt to bleaching substances.It believes this will be a game changer, unlocking significant value for shareholders and boosting the price-to-earnings multiple of the pure-play paints and coatings company, said a person who has had direct conversation with the group’s board.A potentially quick option would be a demerger, with shareholders given stock in the new company. However, one investor described this scenario as “disastrous”, since it could lead to the increased overheads for the new independent entity.Another option is an initial public offering. However, flotations are typically for minority stakes in such situations while recent chemical IPOs have come to market at a valuation discount, analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote last month.Additional reporting by James Fontanella-Khan
32;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-04-12T13:46:58Z;Akzo Nobel accuses Elliott of improper conduct in €22bn battle;Paintmaker says errant emails show activist intended to share details with rival PPG;"Elliott Advisors, the aggressive activist hedge fund, has been accused of improperly seeking to share potentially price-sensitive information in a bitter €22.4bn transatlantic takeover battle between two of the world’s largest paint makers.The accusation by Akzo Nobel, Europe’s top paints and coatings group, came after Elliott, which has been agitating for the Dutch group to hold acquisition talks with US suitor PPG Industries, mistakenly revealed its tactics by sending internal emails to Akzo’s investor-relations department.The errant email chain was seized upon by Akzo on Wednesday in an effort to fend off a move by US-based Elliott and allied investors to sack the company’s chairman, Antony Burgmans.Akzo’s board has rejected two PPG approaches, arguing that both undervalued the company. A combination of the two companies would create a dominant presence in the $130bn global paints and coatings industry.Famous for locking Argentina out of the sovereign bond market for over a decade, Paul Singer-led Elliott has built a reputation for high-profile campaigns to influence boardroom strategy. Among its current battles, it is calling on mining company BHP Billiton to spin off its US oil business and simplify its corporate structure.Elliott which has accumulated a stake of more than 3 per cent in Akzo, the maker of Britain’s Dulux paints, claims it has convinced shareholders owning more than 10 per cent of the company’s stock to back Mr Burgmans’ removal at an emergency general meeting.Akzo said it would decide whether to hold the emergency meeting within 14 days, as Dutch law requires, but the company’s advisers said emails show Elliott was planning on improperly forewarning PPG of its attack strategy against Mr Burgmans.The documents, shared with the Financial Times, show Gordon Singer, the London-based son of Elliott’s founder, asking a colleague to notify PPG that it had submitted a request for a special shareholder meeting, which was not made public at the time.“wiktor [sic] — you should call ppg and let them know that we have sent the EGM request and that now may be an opportune time for ppg to reach out and try to engage,” Mr Singer said in an email sent on April 11.His colleague, Wiktor Sliwinsky, later responded: “Agreed with all the points below, already talked to compliance so they can join me on the call to PPG (so there is no issue with getting cleansed to trade in the near future).”Mr Singer had accidentally copied Lloyd Midwinter, director of investor relations at Akzo, into the email chain, the documents show and multiple people involved confirmed.Akzo said it “strongly” supported Mr Burgmans. It called the proposal to sack him “irresponsible, disproportionate, damaging” and said it would reject tabling an agenda item over his removal.Elliott responded by threatening to take the issue to the Dutch courts. “Shareholders have a legal right under Dutch law to put a proposal to dismiss Mr Burgmans on to the EGM agenda. To the extent that Akzo Nobel refuses to put this item on to the EGM agenda, Elliott intends to use its recourse to the Dutch Courts, including the Enterprise Chamber,” it said.Akzo said it had become aware on Tuesday that Elliott “intended to privately share potentially price-sensitive information with PPG about its decision to request an EGM”. The company said it had referred this to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets and called on Elliott and PPG to “clarify their relationship and the history of the communications between the two companies”.In a statement on Wednesday morning, the Dutch regulator said it had received information from Akzo. “As a supervisor it is our role that we will closely monitor the process in general,” it said. “Moreover we also monitor trading on the stock exchange. We cannot comment on any specific cases as this is subject to supervision confidentiality.”Elliott did not dispute the authenticity of the emails seen by the FT. Elliott Advisors is the European arm of New York-based Elliott Management.“As widely commented by PPG Industries in the media, PPG has met and communicated with Akzo Nobel’s top 20 shareholders; as one of the top 20 shareholders of Akzo Nobel, Elliott has therefore, as a matter of course, met and communicated with PPG,” the hedge fund said.It added that as a Financial Conduct Authority-regulated entity it was aware of its obligations, including with regards to the handling of price-sensitive information.Elliott said: “A substantial portion of Akzo Nobel’s shareholders have requested the company to convene an EGM to vote on the removal of the chairman of the supervisory board. We now call on Akzo Nobel to respect the will of the shareholders and convene the EGM at the shortest notice possible.”PPG said there was no communication about its private takeover proposal to Akzo with any shareholder before the initial offer being publicly rejected on March 9, nor was there any before a second bid was rebuffed on March 22.“There has not been any, and there are currently no agreements or arrangements, in whatever form, between PPG and Elliott Advisors,” it said.Shares in PPG were flat on Wednesday at €79.12. The second PPG offer — a combination of cash and stock — valued Akzo at €88.72 per share.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningThe Amsterdam-based group argues that PPG’s bids undervalue the company and its prospects, and would lead to job cuts and substantial divestitures on competition grounds. The tilt has also attracted political opposition in the Netherlands.Jeremy Redenius, analyst at Bernstein, said he expected “the start of a long struggle”.“We think it’s likely now that Elliott et al will try to take them to court to force the issue,” he added.Akzo will outline a new strategy on April 19, having already said it intends to separate its speciality chemicals business.Additional reporting by Duncan Robinson in Brussels"
33;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-04-12T13:46:18Z;Akzo Nobel: brushed off;The coatings group’s non-engagement with PPG is becoming hard to defend;"If Akzo Nobel thought its robust rejection of a takeover bid from PPG would settle the matter quickly, it is surely disappointed. The rebuff has not ended its US rival’s interest, and is straining relations with its own shareholders. It should reconsider.On Wednesday, Elliott Advisors requested an extraordinary meeting to remove Antony Burgmans, the chairman of Akzo’s supervisory board. It is not really interested in Mr Burgman’s scalp; the move is a procedural one intended to push Akzo into talks with PPG. Akzo has maintained support for its chairman. It has also reported Elliott to the Dutch financial regulator, after Elliott informed PPG of its intentions.Elliott is a professional agitator, but its frustration is shared by many of Akzo’s other shareholders. They are rightly perplexed about Akzo’s refusal to even talk to PPG about a proposal that, in their eyes, has some strategic and financial merit.Akzo says there is no basis for engagement, that the PPG offer undervalues the company and that the purported cost synergies will be undermined by the need to make disposals to satisfy regulators. It would face noisy political opposition in the Netherlands, too. Instead, Akzo thinks separating the specialty chemicals division from the rest of the group would release more value faster and with less risk. After spending several years putting its house in order, it would rather make acquisitions of its own than be swallowed by a rival.These are all valid arguments, which will be fleshed out at an investor day next week. But the choice between a sale and a split is one for shareholders to make. Akzo’s board is attempting to make it for them by shutting out PPG and gambling that the US group will not dare to launch a hostile bid.It has overstepped its mandate in doing so, and the more it antagonises its own investors, the more PPG will be emboldened. By all means, lay out the cards. Then, it is time to talk.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
34;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-04-12T06:00:03Z;Elliott calls for ousting of Akzo Nobel chairman;;Activist investor Elliott Advisors has led calls from a number of shareholders for a special meeting to remove Akzo Nobel’s chairman, according to the Dutch paint maker.Akzo Nobel said it would consider the proposal to hold an extraordinary general meeting to dismiss Antony Burgmans within the statutory 14 days, but that it “strongly” supported the chairman.The company, which owns the Dulux brand of paints, has been locked in a war of words with Elliott over its decision to reject two takeover bids from US rival PPG Industries since early March, the latest for €22.4bn. A combination would create a dominant player in the $130bn global paints and coatings industry.In a sign of the tensions between the sides, Akzo Nobel said it had reported Elliott Advisors – the fund’s UK offshoot – to Dutch financial regulators over its handling of its the EGM request. It said it became aware on Tuesday that “Elliott Advisors intended to privately share potentially price sensitive information with PPG about its decision to request an EGM”.The Dutch group said it had shared this information with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and called on Elliott and PPG to “clarify their relationship and the history of the communications between the two companies”.The Amsterdam-based group says the PPG offer undervalued the company and its prospects, and would lead to job cuts and substantial divestitures on competition grounds. It has attracted political opposition in the Netherlands.Elliott has led a chorus of shareholders urging Akzo Nobel to “engage” with PPG over the approach, with investors owning roughly 17 per cent of the stock having come out publicly on the matter. The hedge fund has a stake above 3 per cent, placing it among the top five shareholders.Elliott did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Akzo Nobel will outline a new strategy on 19 April.
35;PPG;PPG Industries;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The hedge fund Elliott has led calls from a number of large investors, representing roughly 17 per cent of all shares, for Akzo to “engage” with its suitor.The mercurial chief executive of the Pittsburgh-based PPG stressed that all options were on the table, including a hostile takeover if his counterpart at Akzo Nobel refused to engage with PPG.Akzo Nobel says that PPG’s proposals undervalue the company and its prospects, would result in significant job cuts and necessitate substantial sell-offs on competition grounds, as the two companies are leaders in many segments of the $130bn paints and coatings market.In addition, Akzo argues that PPG’s plan would create a combined entity with too much debt and has evoked the notion of unbridgeable “cultural differences”. Several seeming mis-steps have punctuated PPG’s courtship, such as the launch of its initial offer in the middle of a fraught Dutch election campaign.Mr Büchner on Wednesday insisted that he had a plan to “create significant value” at Akzo Nobel “with a proven management team and significantly less risk than [the PPG bid]”.The Amsterdam-based group intends to separate its speciality chemicals business, which makes everything from road salt to substances used in food, cosmetics and electronics.Mr Büchner, who has spent five years making Akzo a leaner and more profitable proposition, said that investors had developed a “certain trust” about his management team.Responding to the antitrust concerns, Mr McGarry said that the “predominant overlap” between the two companies was in western Europe and that there was a “clear and credible path forward”.A number of prospective buyers had reached out to PPG expressing their interest in acquiring the European assets that the US company would have to dispose of to satisfy EU antitrust regulators, he added.To assuage worries around potential closures and lay-offs, PPG has made a number of commitments around employment, research and development and maintaining the headquarters of certain business units in Europe.“I’ve heard people concerned about plants moving to the US — that’s not going to happen,” Mr McGarry said.

Of these, nearly all — 99.6 per cent of their share capital — backed engagement between Akzo Nobel and its US suitor.The survey came as Ton Büchner, Akzo Nobel chief executive, said that the maker of Dulux paint would unveil its own plan to boost profitability on April 19, in a bid to stave off investor discontent.The group, which is planning to sell or float its speciality chemicals business to focus on paints and industrial coatings, said it would “outline plans for the creation of two focused businesses”, without providing further details.Mr Büchner said that the company “was best placed to deliver” a planned restructuring despite signs of displeasure among some of its largest investors after flatly refusing two offers, including one that amounted to €88.72 per share.Shares in Akzo Nobel traded at €77.60 on Tuesday, down 0.9 per cent. Before the bid, shares in the group traded at about €64.“There is a large number of shareholders who are happy,” said one person familiar with the discussion between Akzo Nobel and its shareholders.The person said that those calling for engagement had little to lose: “It is not in a shareholder’s interest to say: ‘don’t’. But there is nothing to lose by saying ‘do’.”Some big shareholders have already gone public about their desire for Akzo Nobel to open official talks with PPG, including Causeway Capital, which owns 6.8 per cent of the company.While Michael McGarry, PPG chief executive, has said that he would prefer not to launch a hostile bid for the Dutch group, the US boss has refused to rule out this option.Akzo Nobel said: “We have a very active dialogue with all of our shareholders.”
38;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-28T08:36:06Z;Akzo Nobel CEO maintains course despite dissent over takeover rejection;;Akzo Nobel’s chief executive has nailed his colours to the mast.Ton Büchner said the company “was best placed to deliver” a planned restructuring despite signs of displeasure among some of its largest investors after the Dutch paints and chemicals group rejected a revised €22.4bn takeover attempt from PPG Industries earlier this month.Mr Büchner made no explicit reference to the offers from its US rival in his comments, published as the maker of Dulux paint said it would provide a strategy update on April 19.But he defended the company’s recent performance and said Akzo Nobel was “delivering on our commitments”.Following the unanimous rejection of PPG’s offer, several large shareholders have criticised Akzo Nobel’s approach, which comes amid a broader pattern of consolidation in the chemicals sector.Activist investor Elliott Advisors, a top five shareholder with more than 3 per cent of the stock, said that while the offer price was inadequate, it provided a “credible basis for engagement”.AkzoNobel, which is planning to sell or float its speciality chemicals business to focus on paints and industrial coatings, said it would “outline plans for the creation of two focused businesses” later this month, without providing further details.Mr Büchner said:We have, during recent years, achieved record performance levels for AkzoNobel in terms of profitability and a range of operational measures, generating value for shareholders. We are delivering on our commitments.Our new strategy will further unlock the value within the company, including the creation of two focused businesses. We are convinced we have a strong platform to build further on our leadership positions to deliver improved profitability and additional long term value creation for shareholders, employees, customers, the communities where we operate and other stakeholders.We are best placed to deliver these plans ourselves, building on the existing momentum we have within the company.
39;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-24T15:56:23Z;PPG bid forces Akzo Nobel’s Ton Büchner to play defence;Chief executive’s strident rejection of offer has rankled many shareholders;"A single letter has upended Ton Büchner’s plans.When the chief executive of Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paints and coatings company, sat down for a meeting with the head of PPG Industries in early March, he thought he was having a friendly chat with his US rival. Instead Michael McGarry, the polished Louisianan head of PPG, handed over a letter offering to buy Mr Büchner’s company.The out-of-the blue approach marked the starting point of a transatlantic tug of war for Akzo Nobel. PPG Industries has launched two bids — worth €20.9bn and then €22.4bn — in three weeks. Akzo Nobel’s management has dismissed both.Dutch politicians have lined up to fight any deal, but some shareholders are growing publicly mutinous and asking Akzo Nobel to engage.Mr Büchner is caught in the middle. The engineer-turned-executive is now the man responsible for keeping a 225-year-old Dutch business out of the clutches of a US rival with a formidable record of dealmaking.After choosing between playing the clarinet or studying engineering at university, Mr Büchner began an international career, based predominantly in Asia. He speaks Mandarin and has been labelled an “Asian with a Dutch passport” in the domestic press. He joined Sulzer Corporation, the SFr3.6bn Swiss industrial group, in 1994 and climbed the internal ladder, ending up chief executive in 2007.The near career-long expat returned to the Netherlands to take the top job at Akzo Nobel in 2012. People who work with Mr Büchner describe him as full on. Sixteen hour days are common. “He is on every call, in every meeting,” says one.This relentlessness came at a cost. Five months after taking over at Akzo Nobel, Mr Büchner took nearly three months off to recover from exhaustion. The share price plunged, but the group stuck by him. “CEOs are also human beings,” the company said.Upon his return, he spent the next five years slowly nursing the Dutch company back to health. Akzo Nobel’s balance sheet was a mess following its acquisition of British company ICI in 2007, which brought with it a gaping pension deficit. Mr Büchner improved financial performance through an efficiency drive, according to investors and analysts.Some criticised his caution. While the chemicals industry was consolidating, Akzo Nobel stood on the sidelines, focusing on its internal problems. Broadly, the strategy worked: the share price nearly doubled from its 2012 low.But some shareholders were not happy. Akzo Nobel trades on a lower multiple than its rivals — and the €88.72 per share offer, which does not count a dividend that Akzo Nobel’s management says it will pay anyway, represents a 35 per cent premium to the undisturbed share price.PPG’s bid represented the outside world intervening on Mr Büchner’s internal focus. While Mr Büchner oversaw nearly 20 deals at Sulzer, M&A has not been a major part of his strategy at Akzo Nobel.In person, Mr Büchner comes across as well-polished, if slightly stiff; confident and firm but rarely deviating from script. This week he told the Financial Times: “I believe we are a good judge of the proposals we’ve had on the table [but] we do also listen carefully to shareholders.”However, his strident rejection of PPG’s courtship has rankled many shareholders, especially his repeated allusions to a clash of cultures that have ended up casting this corporate brouhaha as a transatlantic feud between the Old World and New. “It’s not very open for a great trading nation,” said one shareholder.With investors ratcheting up pressure, Mr Büchner faces a fight with a highly experienced opponent. Mr McGarry boasts of PPG pulling off 50 deals in the past decade. Whether Akzo Nobel becomes the 51st will come down to Mr Büchner."
40;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-23T19:20:50Z;Pressure mounts on Akzo to engage in takeover talks with PPG;Largest shareholder in Dutch group says US rival’s latest bid justified dialogue;"Investor pressure mounted on Akzo Nobel to engage in takeover talks with PPG Industries on Thursday, after its largest shareholder became the latest to call for the Dutch maker of Dulux paint to stop resisting its US rival’s approaches. Causeway Capital, which owns almost 7 per cent of Akzo’s shares according to Bloomberg data, said that PPG’s revised cash and stock bid of €22.4bn was “at a level where management should now engage in discussions with PPG to maximise shareholder value and adequately address the interests of all stakeholders”.Causeway became the latest top 20 shareholder to throw its weight behind pressuring Akzo to the negotiating table. The Dutch company has held its ground, arguing that it has rejected two PPG bids because they undervalue the company and do not address antitrust concerns and the risk of job losses.PPG chief executive Michael McGarry arrived in Amsterdam on Thursday to rally support for his company’s second offer. He told the Financial Times that he would prefer not to proceed with a hostile takeover bid, but refused to rule one out. “That is not PPG’s style,” said Mr McGarry. “We are not taking options off the table. But it is better to work in a collaborative manner.”A deal would combine the number one and two companies in the $130bn paint and coatings market. After PPG’s first offer was disclosed this month, Akzo unveiled a plan to spin off its speciality chemicals business to allay investor concerns over its share price performance. Mr McGarry accused Dutch politicians who have rallied to support Akzo, which has a 225-year history in the Netherlands, of potential hypocrisy — pointing to the company’s acquisition of British chemicals group ICI in 2008. “Talk about buying a crown jewel,” said Mr McGarry. “Now they say it is OK for Akzo Nobel to buy people, but not for PPG to buy Akzo Nobel. You have to be careful about that.” Activist hedge fund Elliott, which owns more than 3 per cent of Akzo’s shares and which has been the most vocal shareholder calling for dialogue between the two companies, criticised chief executive Ton Büchner for refusing to meet with Mr McGarry during his visit to the Netherlands.PPG said its request went unanswered, although Akzo said it had received no request for a meeting. “The [PPG] proposal does not warrant engagement,” said Akzo. “PPG haven’t requested a meeting during their time here, nor is Akzo Nobel soliciting a meeting.""This week, Elliott has been speaking with other Akzo investors about calling a special shareholder meeting to remove the company’s board.However, corporate governance experts said that the chances of a successful hostile bid by PPG were slim. Akzo has a unique, decades-old, Dutch anti-takover defence that makes it practically impossible for shareholders to overthrow the company’s board and install directors who would favour a deal. This is a foundation consisting of four Akzo directors who hold 48 priority shares in the group, and have the right to use this stock to make binding nominations to the management and supervisory boards in any situation where the independent body deems the interests of the company and its stakeholders to be at risk.The foundation’s priority shares were introduced in 1926, according to people who have studied the structure closely. They added that a general meeting of shareholders could not overrule these binding nominations.The possibility to challenge a binding nomination was only allowed under Dutch corporate law in 1928, but the reform allowed arrangements established before that date to remain in place — therefore it is difficult to overcome Akzo’s anti-takeover defence. “If Akzo Nobel wishes to win the hearts and minds of its shareholders it obviously makes no sense to fall back on the foundation, especially if [the bidder] makes a compelling offer and appropriately addresses stakeholder concerns,” said Peter Werdmuller, a Dutch corporate lawyer.“However, as a strict legal matter, it is a very strong defence with no case law on point and thus a risk of protracted litigation and an uncertain outcome, undoubtedly causing [a bidder] and its lending banks to think twice before going hostile.”Analysts at Olivetree said: “Going hostile on Akzo is as close to impossible as it gets.” The second PPG offer for Akzo, outlined on Wednesday, valued the target at €22.4bn, or €88.72 per share excluding a proposed dividend payment by the Dutch group. Including the planned dividend, the offer was pitched at €22.7bn.Mr McGarry attempted to whip up further shareholder discontent. “It was shocking that an enhanced proposal was turned down in basically a day,” he said.He tried to allay concerns over potential job cuts. PPG said there was “overlap” in terms of jobs at the two companies, but stressed that cuts would be across all regions. Dutch politicians have estimated that up to 5,000 jobs in the Netherlands would be axed.The US company has also proposed that the new combined group would be headquartered in Pittsburgh, where PPG is based. Akzo’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to €77.94 on Thursday. PPG’s shares were down 4.3 per cent at $104.40."
41;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-23T13:36:45Z;Akzo Nobel’s largest shareholder pushes for ‘discussions’ with suitor PPG;;Akzo Nobel’s largest shareholder has called on the company to “engage in discussions” with US rival PPG Industries over a possible takeover, following the Dutch paint-maker’s rejection of a second bid worth €22.4bn.Causeway Capital said that while it supported Akzo Nobel’s management view that the latest bid of €90 per share was inadequate, it was “at a level where management should now engage in discussions with PPG to maximize shareholder value and adequately address the interests of all stakeholders”.“As long-term shareholders, we believe combining Akzo Nobel and PPG would create a stronger company, and lead to improved prospects for both shareholders and employees,” it wrote in a letter to Akzo Nobel’s board and executive committee members.Causeway owns 6.8 per cent of Akzo Nobel. Its intervention will pile pressure on the Dutch group’s management to enter into talks with PPG, which has seen two approaches this month firmly rejected by its target.A combination of the companies would create a dominant player in the $130bn paints and coatings market, but Akzo Nobel has said the offers undervalued the company and carried risks of substantial divestments on competition grounds and potential job losses. It insists that the approach does not warrant engagement.Activist investor Elliott, a top-five shareholder, has threatened to call a special shareholder meeting to remove board members if Akzo Nobel does not engage with PPG. Two other top-20 shareholders, Columbia Threadneedle and Henderson, have also urged Akzo Nobel’s management to speak with their counterparts.
42;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-22T17:19:28Z;Akzo Nobel shareholders urge takeover talks with rival PPG;Call follows Dutch company rejecting revised €22.4bn bid from rival US group;"Three large shareholders in Akzo Nobel have urged the company to enter into talks with rival PPG Industries after the Dutch paints and chemicals group rejected a revised €22.4bn takeover attempt from its US rival.The latest unsolicited bid from PPG represented a €1.5bn improvement on an earlier offer, made on March 9, but Akzo Nobel’s two boards again rejected it unanimously. Akzo Nobel’s instant rebuff goes against the tide of large-scale consolidation sweeping the broader chemicals sector and drew criticism from several investors, with one warning that the management was “losing credibility”.The maker of Dulux paint said the second offer, worth €88.72 per share and made on March 20, undervalued the company and its prospects. It also said the proposal did not address “the significant uncertainties and risks for shareholders and other stakeholders” and warned a tie-up would lead to substantial divestitures on competition grounds, as well as job cuts.Combining the groups would be likely to attract stiff scrutiny from antitrust regulators because it would create a dominant group in the $130bn global paints and coatings market.Activist investor Elliott Advisors, a top five shareholder with more than 3 per cent of the stock, said that while the offer price was inadequate, it provided a “credible basis for engagement”.The hedge fund urged Akzo Nobel’s management “to engage with PPG immediately” to determine whether the US group was prepared to bid higher and address all relevant stakeholder considerations.Two other top-20 shareholders echoed Elliott’s position, suggesting that Akzo Nobel’s chief executive, Ton Büchner, faces rising investor dissent as he attempts to see off a hostile buyout of one of Europe’s oldest industrial companies.“We see strong logic in a combination of Akzo Nobel and PPG and the potential benefits this offers all stakeholders. Akzo needs to recognise this and engage,” said David Dudding, portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle.John Bennett, head of European equities at Henderson Global Investors, said Akzo Nobel should “hear out” PPG on its proposal. “If you don’t think it’s right, present a recommendation to the board and shareholders [to vote on].”“The management team is rapidly losing credibility,” he added.VEB, an influential Dutch shareholder group, also called for the company to consider the deal. “They can’t just shut the door. I can understand them saying it is too low. But when a second bid comes in from a serious player, then you should talk to each other,” said Paul Koster, its director.PPG’s new cash and stock offer was worth a total of €88.72 per share. Of this, €56.22 was in cash and 0.331 in PPG shares. Shares in Akzo Nobel fell 1.1 per cent to €75.75 on Wednesday.However, there was some confusion over the actual value of the bid. PPG put the offer at €90 per share including a dividend, for a total value of €22.70, but Akzo Nobel said that included a payout which shareholders would receive regardless.PPG’s advance has attracted criticism from politicians in the Netherlands, who are worried about job losses and the country’s corporate champions being picked off by larger rivals.Their response was especially fierce as PPG’s first bid came during an election campaign and just weeks after Kraft-Heinz’s failed bid for Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer group. Dismissing the new bid on Wednesday, Akzo Nobel’s management complained that there was a “significant culture gap” between the two companies.In his defence, Mr Büchner said the company had “listened carefully” to shareholders and taken their views into consideration when arriving at the decision.Analysts were doubtful whether PPG would return with a third offer.Jeremy Redenius, analyst at Bernstein, said that a survey of investors carried out by the brokerage found investors had been hoping for €95 a share.“We think PPG knew they needed a second bid in the €90s to get engagement from Akzo (eg, opportunity to do due diligence) and elected to not be aggressive enough, which calls into question their desire to return with a yet higher offer,” he wrote in a note.Even so, the latest bid will pile pressure on Mr Büchner to explain his plans for the company, which is planning to sell or float its speciality chemicals business to focus on paints and industrial coatings.During five years at the helm of the group, which traces its roots to Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, Mr Büchner has concentrated on making Akzo Nobel a more efficient operation.

But analysts say the company’s stock trades at an earnings multiple discount to its peers, a situation that can make it more susceptible to takeover attempts.If PPG returns with a higher bid, the Dutch group’s corporate governance has a decades-old provision that creates a foundation with priority shares, which acts as a poison pill to protect the incumbent board and prevent a hostile takeover.But Elliott suggested it might attempt to convene an extraordinary general meeting, at which members of the management and supervisory boards can be voted out, should Akzo Nobel not accede to the shareholders’ requests for engagement.Additional reporting by Alice Ross in London"
43;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-09T18:37:03Z;Akzo Nobel faces stiffest test to its heritage;Dutch group is in rival PPG’s crosshairs despite its own desire to be a hunter;"For the past five years, Ton Büchner has set out to make Dutch paintmaker Akzo Nobel a leaner and more profitable proposition.But the head of the venerable Amsterdam-based group, whose roots date back to 1792, faced the stiffest challenge to its centuries-long European heritage after an unsolicited €20.9bn takeover bid from hard-charging US rival PPG Industries.By firmly rejecting the PPG approach on Thursday, Mr Büchner reiterated his own ambitions for Akzo Nobel to be a driving force of consolidation in the $130bn paints and coatings market.Unfortunately, a lagging share price at his company has opened the door to the unwanted advance from PPG, which with its first bid has offered to pay a 29 per cent premium to Akzo Nobel’s undisturbed share price.“Akzo Nobel has had a bunch of shareholders in its ear for a while now saying ‘[your share price is] too cheap’. That makes it very difficult to achieve your own objectives, which for Akzo Nobel is to be a consolidator,” according to an analyst at Olivetree Securities.The situation sets up a test of Akzo Nobel’s ability to keep its shareholders onside, as some question the speed with which Mr Büchner has moved to keep his company at the forefront of the industry.“We are fully committed to saying no to PPG,” Mr Büchner says, arguing that the PPG offer “substantially undervalues” his company and warned a combination to create a $45bn powerhouse could fall foul of regulators.At a time of growing anti-globalist sentiment, he also invoked the company’s long history and responsibility to its 46,000 workers. Also to his benefit, the offer is the second major attempt to buy a core Dutch business in the last few weeks after US foods group Kraft Heinz tried unsuccessfully to buy Unilever for $143bn.The bids have awakened Dutch politicians to the political implications of large job losses stemming from these deals, just days before the country goes to the polls.Henk Kamp, minister for economic affairs, led the charge on Thursday, stating that the PPG bid was “not in the Dutch interest”.However, the rebuff goes against the tide of consolidation that is sweeping the broader chemicals sector, where some of the world’s largest companies are struggling to grow their sales.In everything from agribusiness to industrial gases, a wave of megadeals have brought companies with complementary products and geographic reaches together.——————-Further coverage of PPG/Akzo Nobel bidLex: Paint feint
News: Akzo Nobel rejects €20.9bn takeover offer
World analysis: Dutch discontent, wealthy but angry——————-PPG’s logic appears soundly rooted in extracting the benefits of greater scale. A deal would also help the two companies respond to a recent deal by one of their main rivals, Sherwin-Williams, which is paying $11.3bn to purchase Valspar.Despite the stiff opposition from Akzo Nobel, PPG signalled that it was not yet walking away. The US group said it continued to “believe there is a strong strategic rationale for the proposed transaction . . . will carefully evaluate and consider its position and path forward related to its proposal”.Michael McGarry, who last year became chairman and chief executive of PPG, said his company had “long admired Akzo Nobel’s businesses, global presence, culture and principles as well as its advances in innovative product development and sustainable business practices”.Mr McGarry sprung the offer at the end of a meeting last Thursday with Mr Büchner, spoiling the chemistry between the two men as Mr Büchner was taken by surprise by the move, people close to the matter said. The Dutch company is working with HSBC and Lazard on its defence, while Goldman Sachs is working with PPG.Since taking over, Mr Büchner has concentrated on making the sprawling group leaner and more profitable. Core profits at the group level increased 2.7 per cent last year to €1.5bn, as measured by adjusted earnings before interest and tax.Investors who have waited for meaningful signs about what comes next may have the first hints as Akzo Nobel revealed that it was studying ways to separate its specialty chemicals business, possibly through a flotation or even a sale.With revenue of €4.8bn in 2016, it accounts for one-third of the group and makes ingredients used in a wide range of products including paints, detergents, foods, plastics, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.A disposal would allow Akzo Nobel to focus on decorative paints and coatings, which among other applications are used for protecting ship hulls against corrosion.“This is a two-stage process for Akzo: get your own share price moving by delivering something quite material . . . which means you can go back to being an acquirer rather than a target,” the Olivetree analysts said.If all else fails in stopping PPG’s pursuit, Mr Büchner has one last tool he could employ. His company’s corporate governance has a decades-old provision that creates a foundation with priority shares that acts as a poison pill to protect the incumbent board and prevent a hostile takeover."
44;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-09T18:35:43Z;Akzo Nobel rejects €20.9bn takeover bid from rival PPG;Offer comes as Dutch concerns on foreign takeovers rise ahead of election;"Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel has rejected an unsolicited €20.9bn takeover bid by US industrial chemicals rival PPG Industries and said it is instead looking at spinning off its specialty chemicals business.Akzo Nobel said on Thursday that the PPG bid substantially undervalued its prospects and it made a broader appeal to its stakeholders by saying the takeover was not in the interests of customers and employees.Dutch MPs from across the political spectrum moved quickly to criticise the US company’s approach, which became the latest high-profile bid for a Dutch company in the middle of a tight election campaign.A combination would bring together two manufacturers of products ranging from protective coatings for iPhones to industrial paints and table salt.However, any deal would likely face significant scrutiny from antitrust authorities given the overlap between the two companies and the already limited range of competition.Akzo Nobel said it had brought forward its plans to review a separation of its specialty unit in response to the unsolicited cash-and-stock bid from PPG, which was made on March 2.The unsolicited proposal we received from PPG substantially undervalues our company and contains serious risks and uncertaintiesThe offer valued shares in Akzo Nobel at €83 each and comprised €54 in cash and in 0.3 PPG stock. That is roughly a 29 per cent premium to Akzo Nobel’s undisturbed share price at the close on Wednesday.Ton Büchner, chief executive of Akzo Nobel, said: “The unsolicited proposal we received from PPG substantially undervalues our company and contains serious risks and uncertainties . . . Along with my colleagues on our boards, our executive team and our thousands of employees, I firmly believe that Akzo Nobel is best placed to unlock the value within our company ourselves.”He added: “We understand our role in society and want to protect our ability to continue to invest in communities, research and development, innovation and sustainability in the countries in which we operate.”Later in the day, PPG confirmed its offer and indicated it would not abandon its pursuit.Michael McGarry, chairman and chief executive of the Pittsburgh-based company, said: “We are confident that this combination is in the best interests of the stakeholders of both companies as it presents a unique opportunity to build on the successful legacies of our businesses.”PPG added that it still believed there was a “strong strategic rationale” for a deal and that it would “carefully evaluate and consider its position and path forward related to its proposal”.Shares in Akzo Nobel jumped 13 per cent to €72.79 in Amsterdam trading, giving the company’s equity a value of €18.4bn. PPG shares fell 3.6 per cent to $103.09 in by early afternoon in New York, making its equity worth $28.1bn.Jeremy Redenius, an analyst at Bernstein, said: “We think a combination is credible and potentially powerful.”The unsolicited bid comes at a politically sensitive time in the Netherlands, where nationalist sentiments are on the rise ahead of next week’s general election.It comes just weeks after Kraft Heinz launched a $143bn bid for Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, which shocked the Dutch business community and politicians.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who earlier this week called for the government to have greater power to block foreign takeovers of domestic companies that were deemed to be against the national interest, said: “A takeover of Akzo Nobel is absolutely not in Dutch interest.”He added: “This hostile takeover would lead to a split, sale and disappearance of knowledge and research in our country. And would be harmful to the long-term economic strength of the Netherlands.”——————-Further coverage of PPG/Akzo Nobel bidLex: Paint feint
Corporate analysis: Akzo Nobel chief Büchner faces stiffest test
World analysis: Dutch discontent, wealthy but angry——————-Mainstream parties in the Netherlands are coming under pressure from the surge in popularity of Geert Wilders’ far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), which is riding the anti-immigrant and populist wave that has swept Europe in recent years.A hostile or unfriendly takeover of Akzo Nobel would be complicated because the Dutch company has sufficient powers in its corporate governance to block any hostile approach.Akzo Nobel tried to appease investors by saying it had brought forward plans to separate its specialty chemicals unit, which had revenues of €4.8bn in 2016 and makes ingredients used in products including paints, detergents, foods, plastics, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.Since taking over as Akzo Nobel’s chief executive in 2012, Mr Büchner has concentrated on making the sprawling group leaner and more profitable. That has involved restructuring, job cuts and closing facilities.After hitting financial targets he had set out for the company, Mr Büchner said in February 2016 that the company had “earned the right” to make bolt-on acquisitions.Its core profit increased 2.7 per cent in 2016 to €1.5bn, as measured by earnings before interest and tax after excluding one-off items. It attributed this to greater production volumes and lower costs.But revenue fell 4.5 per cent to €14.2bn, which it blamed on unfavourable currency movements and “price/mix effects”, implying that lower-priced products accounted for a greater proportion of total sales.Akzo Nobel’s performance coatings division has suffered from tough conditions in the marine and oil and gas industries.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that the Dutch election is next week, not next month"
45;PPG;PPG Industries;2017-03-09T15:19:31Z;Akzo Nobel/PPG: paint feint;Split could yield more value than bid at current level;Call it the Unilever defence. A foreign bidder comes calling. The target slams the door shut, bemoaning the price and the risks. For good measure, it invokes the national interest plus obligations to other stakeholders, then spikes the acquirer’s guns by saying it will pursue a similar strategy.The 30 per cent premium offered by US coatings group PPG for its Dutch rival Akzo Nobel was higher than the 18 per cent that Kraft Heinz pitched to Unilever’s shareholders. Even so, this was an easy deal to reject, which Akzo Nobel did publicly on Thursday. There is some overlap in market positions, suggesting antitrust scrutiny was likely. The combined company would, initially at least, have been fairly highly geared. There would have been a political backlash in the Netherlands.PPG would likely not have wanted Akzo Nobel’s specialty chemicals business, and selling it on might have helped reduce leverage. Akzo Nobel says it will now pursue a separation of the unit itself, something it may have been planning to announce at a capital markets day later this year.One likely consequence would be to raise the valuation ascribed to its shares. Akzo Nobel has no particular need to raise cash, so assume it distributes shares in its speciality chemicals unit to its own investors rather than selling it. On the basis of peers such as Clariant and Lanxess (itself a spin-off from Bayer in 2005), Akzo Nobel’s specialty chemicals division might attract an enterprise value of about €7.5bn. Applying the higher valuations commanded by pure-play paints and coatings businesses to Citi’s estimates suggests that unit might be worth €17.7bn. Add the two together, back out the existing debt and an implied share price of €94 emerges.That is comfortably ahead of the €83 value of the PPG bid and — absent a higher offer — would vindicate chief executive Ton Büchner’s decision to send the Americans packing.Such financial engineering is all very well, but it does not fix Akzo Nobel’s key operating issue: lack of revenue growth. Paint volumes grew 3 per cent last year, coatings were flat. Group revenues have barely shifted in a decade, although profits have improved thanks to Mr Büchner’s focus on costs and returns, and the dividend is rising again after a cut in 2009.Akzo Nobel bought BASF’s coatings business last year for €475m. It may have to step up its acquisition plans if it is to see off future predators.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

News of the talks emerged at a politically sensitive time in the Netherlands, where nationalist sentiments are on the rise ahead of next month’s general election.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said on Tuesday that the government should be given greater powers to block foreign takeovers of domestic companies that were deemed to be against the national interest.The comments made by the usually open minded Labour politician, comes as mainstream parties in the Netherlands are coming under pressure from the surge in popularity of Geert Wilders’ far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), which is riding the anti-immigrant and populist wave that has swept Europe in the past years.It was unclear whether the talks held between the two groups were on friendly terms or whether PPG is trying to do a hostile takeover.Akzo Nobel’s US shares rose 12 per cent, giving it a market value of about $17bn, after Bloomberg first reported that PPG was exploring a potential deal.

There was no immediate comment from Comex on whether it expected regulatory hurdles this time.Comex announced last month that it was suing Sherwin-Williams for undisclosed damages over the failure of its offer. Comex said Sherwin-Williams had not tried hard enough to honour the deal after the takeover was rejected on the grounds it would create unfair concentration in the Mexican paint market.Pittsburgh-based PPG, one of the world’s largest paint companies, is seeking a full takeover of the Mexican company, founded in 1952, which had sales of about $1bn last year. The deal will hinge on regulatory approval.PPG plans to fund the purchase primarily in cash and using some short-term investments – it has $3bn in hand in cash and investments. It also expects to take on some debt to fund the deal, and sees synergies of 3-4 per cent of acquired sales over two years.“Comex is a high-quality, well-managed business with a long heritage of excellent customer service and leading, well-recognised regional brands,” said Charles E. Bunch, PPG chairman and chief executive.“The acquisition is very complementary to PPG as it adds a leading architectural coatings business in Mexico and Central America, a region where we have negligible architectural coatings presence. We are excited to participate in the growing Mexican economy,” he said.PPG sees the acquisition as consistent with its strategy to expand its global portfolio. “Following this transaction, we will continue to have a strong cash balance, expanded free cash flow and a high degree of financial flexibility, and we expect additional, disciplined cash deployment focused on value creation for our shareholders,” Mr Bunch added.Comex sells its products through 3,600 stores that are independently owned and operated by concessions, as well as through regional retailers and direct sales. It has about 3,900 staff, eight manufacturing facilities and six distribution centres.

Monday’s deal also includes Intercast, an Italian sunglasses manufacturer.Essilor shares rose 5.9 per cent on the announcement, reaching €85.39 by early afternoon trading. The stock has gained more than 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.Analysts welcomed the move. “We see this as a landmark deal for Essilor,” said Jonathan Beake at Citi. “They didn’t pay too much for it and it’s a segment that has high growth rates and higher margins than the overall eyeglass industry.”HSBC said the announcement would remove uncertainty about Essilor’s joint venture with US-based PPG ever since the two companies said they were studying several options a few months ago. “Today’s deal is a significant one,” it said in a research note.Essilor said the deal, the latest in a recent flurry of cross-border mergers, acquisitions and sales involving French companies, would “lead to a significant improvement in the group’s profitability”.The company said the deal would boost its operating margins to 19.5 per cent from year two. They are about 18 per cent now.In a separate statement, PPG, which manufactures paint and coatings, said it would use the cash for acquisitions as well as to buy back its own shares.Both companies said they expected to complete the deal by the first half of next year.
49;PPG;PPG Industries;2012-12-16T15:54:06Z;Akzo Nobel – paint job;Even after the sale, the group appears to be fairly well-balanced;"Talk about a man in a hurry. Ton Büchner became chief executive of Akzo Nobel in April. Since then he has replaced the heads of two of the Dutch chemicals group’s three divisions, taken a €2.4bn writedown on its 2007 takeover of Imperial Chemical Industries, and – on Friday – sold its underperforming US paints business to PPG Industries for $1bn. Oh, and he also spent nearly three months out on medical leave (suffering from fatigue), returning only 10 days ago. Should he slow down, or keep on running?More of the latter, ideally. Akzo Nobel has taken a while to digest the ICI purchase, which cost it £8bn at the height of the mergers and acquisitions bubble. The purchase left it with sub-scale divisions here and there, and in particular in the US decorative paints market, where it was operating in the shadow of PPG and Sherwin-Williams. It has taken four years for Akzo Nobel to turn the unit around – it has just returned to profit after several years of losses, so now looks like a good time to sell. The disposal should also help to boost Akzo Nobel’s earnings margins. The group has a medium-term target for margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 13 to 15 per cent. Its group average in the third quarter of 2012 was 12.6 per cent.Even after the sale – the unit accounted for about 7 per cent of the group’s annual revenue (€16bn in 2011) – Akzo Nobel looks fairly well-balanced, with three core divisions in speciality chemicals, performance coatings and decorative paints. The proceeds will help to reduce net debt, which is about 1.4 times 2011 ebitda; Mr Büchner also wants to invest in organic growth. Investors seemed to like the disposal: its shares jumped 7.5 per cent, taking the gain for the year to a very respectable 30 per cent. Still, Akzo Nobel has been a laggard over a longer time horizon against peers such as DSM. Mr Büchner plans a strategy update in February. He may already have given away the highlight.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
50;PPG;PPG Industries;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;PPG sells unit via tax-efficient trust;;"PPG Industries, an industrial coatings company based in Pittsburgh with a nearly $17bn market capitalisation, has found a tax-efficient way to dispose of its commodities chemicals division.Georgia Gulf, a smaller chemicals company based in Atlanta that turned down a hostile bid earlier this year, will buy the unit in a deal valued at $2.1bn, strengthening its position as an independent company.PPG will spin or split off the unit into a new company, then immediately merge it with Georgia Gulf through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which is tax efficient for the companies.Paul Carrico, chief executive of Georgia Gulf, said the deal would give his company a new leadership position in integrated chemicals and building products, which would benefit from integration and scale and be positioned to take advantage of cheap natural gas prices in the southern US.Charles Bunch, chief executive of PPG, said disposing of the commodity chemicals unit would allow his company to focus on coatings and speciality products and improve its cash position.Georgia Gulf will pay $900m in cash to PPG; assume $95m of debt and take a minority interest of $87m in PPG.PPG shareholders will receive about 50.5 per cent of the new company, valued at $1bn based on Georgia Gulf’s closing stock price on Wednesday.With the acquisition, Georgia Gulf will have revenues of about $5bn and become the third-largest chlor-alkali producer and second-largest vinyl chloride monomer producer in North America. Mr Carrico will remain chief executive and Georgia Gulf will control eight of the 11 board seats.Georgia Gulf was the target of a $1.2bn bid from rival Westlake Chemical in January. During the hostile bid, Westlake increased its offer by 17 per cent to $35 a share. But Georgia Gulf adopted a “poison pill” to defend itself from the bid, saying it undervalued the company. Westlake dropped its bid in May. Georgia Gulf closed below $29 a share on Wednesday.Georgia Gulf shares were up nearly 16 per cent on the news in early trading on Thursday, with PPG shares up 5 per cent.Barclays and Houlihan Lokey advised Georgia Gulf, which received legal counsel from Jones Day on both the hostile defence and the deal. PPG was advised by Lazard and obtained legal advice from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz."
51;PPG;PPG Industries;2011-06-27T15:41:27Z;AkzoNobel warns on profits;;AkzoNobel, the Dutch paint and chemicals company, issued a profit warning on Monday, joining the ranks of companies forced to revise expectations this quarter because of high raw materials prices and weaker than expected demand.The company said its second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation would come in around €550m ($784m), some €100m lower than consensus expectations and down 15 per cent year on year.Sales have risen, particularly in growth markets, but prices for raw materials are up some 20 per cent over the same period.Following last week’s announcement of price hikes by US paint company PPG, the AkzoNobel warning signals that a combination of weak demand in North America and Europe and high prices for the key component titanium dioxide are exerting pressure on margins in the coatings sector. The company said it expected margins to remain flat from the first quarter.Revenues continue to grow, with total sales expected to come in 7 per cent higher than the €3.9bn the company booked in sales for the second quarter of 2010.Hans Wijers, chief executive, said AkzoNobel remains on course for annual earnings to equal those last year, assuming no further economic deterioration. The company had earlier indicated ebitda would be 5 per cent higher.“We are on track in terms of our medium-term growth ambitions,” Mr Wijers said. He said the company planned to pass on higher costs to consumers over the upcoming two quarters.Mr Wijers, a former Dutch Minister of Finance who reformed the company from a broad conglomerate into a tightly focused paint and chemicals group, announced earlier this month he will step down in 2012 after nine years at the helm. That announcement was viewed as well-timed in view of the company’s strengthening recent performance, but the profit warning may throw a shadow over the company’s future.Analyst Michel Veul of SNS Securities said the lower-than-expected margins were understandable given the steep rise in raw materials costs, which will take one to two quarters to pass through to prices.“The raw materials side is something of a timing issue. The company is catching up,” agreed Mutlu Gundogan of RBS.But some analysts questioned whether the company had sufficient data to back up its expectation that raw materials prices had stabilised.In a conference call with analysts, Keith Nichols, chief financial officer, said demand continued to grow strongly in the company’s specialty chemicals division, where sales rose 8 per cent year on year. In both of its other two divisions, decoration and performance coatings, sales rose 5 per cent, with demand strong in growth markets but weak in the mature markets of Europe and North America.Specialty chemicals were also hit by maintenance stops at European production facilities that took longer than expected, resulting in a €15m impact on earnings. Mr Nichols said no further maintenance problems are expected in upcoming quarters.The company said demand had been weak for products linked to the housing and construction sector, such as wood coatings and adhesives. Products tied to industrial sectors such as automotive coatings were doing well.

Overall, earnings are likely to pleasantly surprise the markets.“The question is what happens after the earnings cycle. We are probably looking at seasonal weakness around the summer, where we could get a 5-10 per cent correction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,211.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,144.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,515.69.UPS added 5.3 per cent to $68.89 after the package delivery company, which is often regarded as a bellwether for the wider economy, reported better-than-expected quarterly results after the session’s close on Wednesday and raised its full-year earnings forecasts.Adjusted earnings were 71 cents a share, up from 52 cents last year and above consensus expectations of 57 cents.Revenue rose 7 per cent, helped by significant volume growth in international markets.Rival FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline, was up 1.7 per cent to $95.62.Yum Brands rallied 2.6 per cent to $42.78 after reporting strong first-quarter results after the close of the session on Wednesday.The company, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other restaurant chains, said profit in the quarter rose 11 per cent, boosted by strong sales in China and a Pizza Hut $10 pizza promotion.Shares in Citigroup pulled back 2.4 per cent to $4.81. For much of the session they bounced around the $5 mark – an important level for the stock because some investment funds are prohibited by their own charters from investing in sub-$5 stocks.Las Vegas Strip casino owner MGM Mirage dipped 5.5 per cent to $14.57 after posting a preliminary first-quarter loss of 22 cents a share and revenues of $1.46bn.

53;PPG;PPG Industries;2009-05-26T04:25:09Z;US wind power: Industry sets sights on large slice of the pie;;More than 23,000 people turned out for this month’s American Wind Energy Association annual conference and exhibition. That was up from 13,000 last year and 1,000 in 2001. There is no doubt interest in wind energy is growing in the US.Indeed, the US has overtaken Germany to become the world’s biggest generator of wind energy. With the Obama Administration having just finalised a framework for renewable energy production offshore, the use of wind energy across the US is expected to grow further.Until now, it has all been land production and meets only about 1 per cent of US energy needs. Joe Biden, US vice-president, says: “By harnessing offshore wind power and other resources, we will be able to power tens of millions of homes using clean, renewable power.’’The National Renewable Energy Lab has identified more than 1,000 gigawatts of wind potential off the Atlantic coast and more than 900 gigawatts of wind potential off the Pacific Coast.The only issue is financing that growth. Given the economic crisis and plunge in commodity prices, which have made wind less economic versus oil and gas, some projects have had to be delayed or cancelled. Indeed, one analyst joked that that attendance was up at this year’s wind conference because so many people are looking for work.For the industry to meet the demand for new jobs, it needs a large slice of the pie that the US government has promised the renewable sector. The Obama administration’s economic stimulus package includes $56bn in grants and tax breaks for US clean energy projects over the next 10 years and a budget of $15bn a year to fund renewable energy programmes.T Boone Pickens, the oilman turned wind devotee, noted in an interview that the Obama Administraion may have to help a little more than it planned to, given the downturn. However, he is still on track to build the world’s biggest wind farm in Texas, with 2,700 turbines generating enough power for 1m US homes.The 80-year-old Mr Pickens has made it his mission to convert the US to using wind to generate the 22 per cent of the nation’s electricity that is now powered by natural gas. That would free natural gas to be used as a fuel for transport and reduce US dependence on foreign oil.In April, Mr Pickens noted to his followers: “Last month alone, we sent $18bn overseas, importing 386m barrels of oil. If we had a real and sensible energy policy, we could keep that money here in the US, enabling us to hire more than 1m teachers, or to create the broadband infrastructure needed to connect every household and business in the country, or to even restore the National Mall.’’He says: “We must harness our domestic resources to keep the money we spend on energy overseas right here instead, creating jobs and building important projects for America.”The wind-power industry thinks the key is a Renewable Electricity Standard, requiring that some 25 per cent of electricity be generated by renewables by 2025.Denise Bode, the chief executive of the American Wind Energy Association, says: “The nation still lacks the long-term signal that is needed to build up renewable energy on large scale. The time is now for a national renewable electricity standard, a policy that more than 80 per cent of Americans favour and for which they voted.”She explains: “President Obama’s campaign position of generating 25 per cent of our electricity from renewable energy sources by 2025 will help revitalise our economy and protect consumers when they need it the most: when the price of the fuels used for electricity generation goes up.”Yet a Congressional committee is considering lower targets, given that some states are unsuitable for producing wind, solar or biofuels to meet their renewable electricity quotas, which has prompted concerns among wind proponents.Interested parties wrote to Congress that they were concerned that the significantly lower renewable targets being discussed “will severely blunt the signal for companies like ours that manufacture turbines and components to invest billions of dollars to expand production and our workforces in the US.’’The senders were representatives of GE Energy, Vestas Americas, Gamesa, NRG Systems, REPower USA, Broadwind Energy, TPI Composites, PPG Industries, Clipper Windpower and the American Wind Energy Association.It is only with the right policies that the wind energy industry will continue to grow, says Vic Abate, vice-president for Renewables at GE Energy.
54;PPG;PPG Industries;2007-11-22T00:31:26Z;Akzo could consign ICI brand to history;;Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals company that is set to buy the UK’s ICI, formerly Imperial Chemical Industries, may scrap the ICI brand, ending its 81-year history.Hans Wijers, chief executive of Akzo, told the Financial Times on Wednesday that his company was researching the value of the brand, and would decide whether or not to use it by the time the deal closes on January 2.“If the word ‘imperial’ was explicitly used in the brand, we would never use it,” said Mr Wijers, who has led Akzo since 2002, and was once a Dutch economic affairs minister.“But as ICI is well recognised we are trying to see if there are stakeholders who have positive associations with it – we are still trying to answer that question.”ICI, the maker of Dulux paints, is credited with making the first plastic in the 1930s, and says it was the first company to market solid emulsion paint for application by roller by the domestic consumer.By the time of its sale, less than 12 per cent of revenue came from the UK, as it had expanded into the US, Asia, and other countries.The Dulux, Hammerite, and Glidden brands will all continue after the transactions, Mr Wijers pointed out.ICI agreed to be bought by Akzo for £8bn ($16.5bn) in August, just as the credit squeeze was setting in. The combined group will be the world’s biggest paintmaker with 14 per cent market share, eclipsing PPG Industries of the US.Mr Wijers said that nothing that had happened to the global economy since Akzo agreed to buy ICI threatened the cost and efficiency savings derived from combining the two companies.“Year one, we’ll see costs outweighing benefits with restructuring expenses and one-off items but by year two we’ll see some synergies and by year three we will definitely be outgrowing our markets and have above-average ebitda margins,” he said.Akzo has said it expects pre-tax cost synergies of €280m ($415m). “I will eat my hat, or someone else’s, if we do not get there,” said Mr Wijers.He added that it was still possible that once integration began there would be more synergies than initially estimated.“I sincerely hope we will find more and I am an optimistic guy but so far there is no evidence that we will beat what we’ve already said.”Mr Wijers added that along with all the practical work of combining the two businesses there would be a cultural adaptation, as 20,000 people would be joining the group from ICI.He hoped ICI’s skills in marketing would spread throughout the company, so that more of its products could take on luxury status and therefore higher margins.
55;PPG;PPG Industries;2007-06-17T21:04:06Z;Pensions warning to ICI bidder;;"ICI pension trustees are insisting on a central role in any takeover talks between the UK chemicals group and Akzo Nobel, the Dutch conglomerate.The demand came yesterday as ICI rejected a takeover proposal from Akzo valued at £7.2bn (€10.6bn). A spokesman for ICI’s pension trustees said: “We would have expected to have an early and direct conversation with anyone wanting to replace ICI as owner of the company.”He highlighted the power of the trustees to determine the size of the deficit, which could range from £500m up to £2.2bn, depending on their view of a bidders’ financial strength and their confidence in the bidders’ willingness to fund long-term promises to pensioners.The scheme’s liabilities are more than £9.2bn, against a market capitalisation of £6.5bn, according to the company.He said: “If faced with someone who hasn’t talked with us, we would have to form a different, harsher view [of the owner]. That would be another factor in determining the size of the deficit.“We are agnostic about who owns ICI, but not about the strength of the promise.“If we perceive the promise [of whoever sponsors the pension scheme] is legally and financially weaker, that would increase the size of the deficit. It would be better to have an up-front conversation.”Akzo, which has appointed Morgan Stanley as adviser, is understood to have proposed an offer of about 600p a share. This was rejected by ICI’s board as being too low.Analysts, many of whom consider 600p to be an attractive price, said the approach could trigger competing bids from rivals including BASF, DuPont and Dow Chemical, and even possibly from private equity.The Dutch company is sitting on a large cash pile after it sold its pharmaceuticals business to Schering-Plough, the US drugs group, for €11bn in cash in March.Any deal would be likely to raise competition concerns in the paint market, where Akzo owns the Crown brand.Dulux has 40 per cent of the UK paints market and Crown has 14 per cent.The combination of the two paints businesses would create a market leader with more than twice the 4.2 per cent global share of its nearest rival PPG Industries of the US, according to analysts.John McAdam, ICI chief executive, is expected to discuss the approach at the company’s investor day on Wednesday.ICI shares, which have risen almost 25 per cent over the past six months on takeover speculation, closed at 549p, up 2½p,
on Friday."
56;PPG;PPG Industries;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
