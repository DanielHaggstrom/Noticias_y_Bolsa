0;SWKS;Skyworks Solutions;2016-09-15T19:03:03Z;Apple, oil help US stocks extend gains;;US stocks extended their gains on Thursday driven by a fourth day of advances in Apple shares and rise in crude prices.The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 per cent to 2,148.77 by mid-afternoon trading, led by a 1.7 per cent gain in the information technology sector.Skyworks Solutions, a chip supplier to Apple, clocked the biggest gains in the sector, rising more than 6 per cent. But it was a fourth straight day of gains for Apple that caught investors’ attention.Apple shares advanced 3 per cent to $115.05 on Thursday and have climbed nearly 12 per cent over the past four days — adding more than $50bn to its market valuation — amid higher than expected demand for its latest iPhone.US stocks were also buoyed by a rally in shares of energy companies. A leak in the Colonial Pipeline that carries gasoline helped push crude prices higher and in turn prompted a 1.5 per cent gain in the S&P 500 energy sector.Elsewhere, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury climbed to 1.703 per cent from 1.689 per cent on Wednesday.A batch of disappointing economic data also lowered expectations that the Fed may not add to its December rate rise when it meets next week. Indeed, federal fund futures now imply just an 18 per cent chance of a rate rise at the Fed’s September meeting.

Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont has been under pressure from Nelson Peltz, the leader of activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management, to turn round its performance. Mr Peltz failed in a push earlier this year to secure a seat on the company’s board of directors.The blue-chip chemical company also cut its full-year earnings guidance as a result of a stronger dollar and tougher conditions in its agriculture unit. DuPont now expects full-year earnings of $2.75 a share, down from a previous outlook of $3.10.DuPont’s revenues fell 11 per cent in the second quarter from the year before, while operating earnings per-share ticked up 1 per cent on the same basis.The shares climbed 7.7 per cent to $55.23, cutting the year-to-date loss to about 25 per cent.Elsewhere, Freeport-McMoRan shares rallied 6 per cent to $11.85 after the company revealed plans to explore strategic alternatives for its oil and gas business. The company, which also cut the size of its board of directors, said it was considering a potential spin-off, joint venture or more cost cuts. A previously announced strategy to sell a minority stake in the oil and gas segment in a public offering also remains on the table.Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport-McMoRan is one of the world’s biggest copper producers, but generated about 20 per cent of its overall revenue from its oil and gas business in 2014. Its shares have collapsed by half this year amid the swoon in commodity prices.Skyworks Solutions saw its shares dip 1.4 per cent to $80.71. The semiconductor company, which makes chips for Apple, said late Monday it would buy PMC-Sierra for roughly $2bn in cash. The transaction valued PMC at $10.50 a share, a 36.5 per cent premium to the company’s closing price before the deal was announced.Microsoft shares ticked up by 12 cents to $46.75 after the software group took the wraps off a duo of new smartphones. The company also updated its Surface tablet and Band fitness tracker.The healthcare segment was the biggest laggard of the major S&P 500 sectors. The losses were led by a sell-off in the biotechnology segment.Illumina faced some of the steepest losses on the closely tracked Nasdaq biotechnology index, tumbling 10.6 per cent to $145.81. The pharmaceutical company disclosed after the bell on Monday a full-year sales outlook that missed Wall Street forecasts.On the other side of the spectrum, energy shares were lifted by a rally in the price of brent crude oil. Transocean, one of the biggest offshore drilling contractors, jumped 7.3 per cent to $15.76. Oil majors advanced as well: ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $77.89, while Chevron jumped 3.5 per cent to $87.By close, the S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,979.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 16,790.19 and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 0.7 per cent to 4,748.36.

The other suspects are still in China.Mr Zhang and fellow professor Wei Pang are accused of stealing information about a technology used in smartphones, tablets and GPS devices from their US employers, Skyworks Solutions in Massachusetts and Avago Technologies in Colorado, respectively. The technology also has military applications.The charges represent the latest sign of the US ratcheting up pressure on China’s alleged efforts to spy on US companies and steal their trade secrets through cyber attacks or traditional espionage techniques.The charges follow the indictment of five Chinese soldiers in 2014 for cyber attacks and economic espionage on US companies. Tuesday’s announcement marks the 11th time that prosecutors have levelled economic espionage charges since the related law was passed in 1996.In 2014, a consultant called Walter Liew was found guilty of 22 counts of economic espionage for stealing information about how DuPont creates a white pigment found in paper and plastic products, to sell to a Chinese company.In the latest case, the stolen trade secrets include recipes, source code, specifications, presentations, design layouts and other documents, according to the 32-count indictment that was recently unsealed.An attorney for Mr Zhang did not respond to a request for comment. Skyworks and Avago were not immediately available for comment.Messrs Zhang and Pang met when they were studying the technology, known as thin-film bulk acoustic resonator or FBAR, as electrical engineering doctoral students in California. Their research was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, which creates technology used by the US military and national security agencies.FBAR technology, which filters wireless signals to receive and send only what is intended by the user, is also used in military and defence products.Professors Pang and Zhang, along with others, set up a business plan and pitched Chinese universities on manufacturing FBAR technology in China, the indictment said.The conduct reveals a methodical and relentless effort by foreign interests to obtain and exploit sensitive and valuable US technology“The defendants leveraged their access to and knowledge of sensitive US technologies to illegally obtain and share US trade secrets with [China] for economic advantage,” said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin.In 2008, officials from Tianjin University, a Chinese Ministry of Education institution, travelled to California to meet Messrs Pang and Zhang, after which the university decided to establish a FBAR fabrication facility in China, prosecutors charged.The following year, Messrs Pang and Zhang resigned from Avago and Skyworks to become professors at Tianjin University, which formed a joint venture named ROFS Microsystem with the two men and others.The stolen trade secrets helped the university establish a state of the art FBAR fabrication facility and to obtain contracts for providing FBARs to commercial and military entities, according to the indictment.The other Chinese citizens who were indicted include Tianjin professor Jinping Chen, who is also a board director at ROFS Microsystems, and Huisui Zhang, who studied with Messrs Pang and Zhang in California.Also charged were Chong Zhou, a Tianjin graduate student and a design engineer at ROFS Microsystem, and Zhao Gang, general manager of ROFS Microsystem.“The conduct reveals a methodical and relentless effort by foreign interests to obtain and exploit sensitive and valuable US technology through the use of individuals operating within the United States,” said David Johnson, the FBI Special Agent in Charge.Additional reporting by Mark Odell in London
3;SWKS;Skyworks Solutions;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
