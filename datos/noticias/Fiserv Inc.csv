0;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2019-01-16T16:45:34Z;Payments processor Fiserv to buy rival First Data in $39bn deal;Deal comes amid rising M&A activity in payments industry;US payments processor Fiserv has agreed to purchase heavily indebted rival First Data in an all-stock deal that values the company at roughly $39bn, in one of the largest financial services takeovers since the crisis. The deal comes as disruption in the payments industry heats up, with a wave of consolidation seen among traditional financial services providers and technology groups.Fiserv, which has more than 12,000 clients, sells financial processing systems that help banks and other institutions complete debit, credit and cash machine transactions. First Data provides payment processing systems such as credit card readers for small and large businesses as well as ecommerce services.First Data stockholders will receive 0.303 shares of Fiserv for each share of First Data they currently hold, worth roughly $22.74 based on the close of trading on Tuesday. The offer represented a premium of nearly 30 per cent to First Data’s closing share price on Tuesday of $17.54, but was nonetheless below a recent high marked last September when First Data shares climbed to $26.62. The share price dropped sharply a month later after the payments processor missed its profits estimates and trimmed revenue growth targets. Acquisition activity in the payments technology space — which includes the likes of Apple Pay and Square, as well as the back-end infrastructure that enables transactions — has been on the rise as consumers and merchants turn increasingly to cashless payment methods. First Data has been seen at somewhat of a disadvantage in the race, as the company lumbered under a multibillion-dollar debt burden from its $28bn takeover by private equity group KKR. The company struggled with those financial obligations, earning junk ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the US. Its more than $17bn of debts had limited First Data’s ability to invest in its core business, but the takeover by Fiserv would give the combined group a stronger investment grade-rated balance sheet.First Data has found some success in its fierce competition with Square for boutique coffee shops, restaurants and other small businesses owners. Transaction volumes on its tablet-based device — known as Clover — are now running at a $70bn annualised rate, the company said, up 45 per cent from a year ago. Square, by contrast, processed more than $22bn of transactions in the third quarter of 2018, or just under $90bn on an annualised basis.“Through this transformative combination, we expect to redefine the manner in which people and institutions move money and information,” said Jeffery Yabuki, chief executive of Fiserv. The two companies said they expected to complete the deal by the second half of this year. Fiserv hopes to wring $900m of costs out of the two groups over the next five years and plans to refinance First Data’s debts. Fiserv added it would suspend its share repurchase programme until the transaction closes to minimise its debt obligations.First Data shares climbed 19 per cent in early-morning trading to $20.89, while Fiserv declined 6 per cent to $70.83.The deal ranks among the largest acquisitions in the finance industry since the crisis, according to data provider Refinitiv. Within the payments sector, it is second only to the spin-off of PayPal from eBay in 2015, separate data from Dealogic showed. George Mihalos, an analyst with Cowen, said he was surprised by the timing and price at which First Data agreed to the sale. But he added that he believed the deal “makes sense” for Fiserv.“The transaction will increase Fiserv’s exposure to larger and mid-tier banks where the company is currently under represented,” Mr Mihalos said. “The combined entity should be able to sustain organic revenue growth of at least 5 per cent going forward.”JPMorgan Chase and law firm Sullivan & Cromwell advised Fiserv. Bank of America and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett provided advice to First Data.
1;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2017-08-07T16:11:15Z;Fiserv sweetens bid for UK’s Monitise;Investors expected reluctantly to accept offer improved by just £5m;Fiserv, the US financial technology group, improved its offer for its beleaguered UK counterpart Monitise, in a final effort to win over rebellious investors.The Wisconsin-based tech group on Monday tabled a 3.1p a share cash offer for Monitise, up slightly from its previous bid of 2.9p, which was rejected by shareholders as valuing the fintech company at a fraction of its historic worth.Monday’s offer represented a 34.8 per cent premium to the Monitise share price before any takeover approaches. It should pave the way for a deal, after a miserable three years in which the Aim-listed group has lost some of its largest customers and issued a number of sales warnings.“Fiserv firmly believes that the increased and final offer constitutes full and fair value for Monitise given the financial outlook for the group and the structural challenge the group faces,” the US group said.The Monitise board, which unanimously recommended the bid, added: “Monitise directors reiterate their belief that the strategic alternatives to a takeover . . . are accompanied by significant execution risk.”Investors met the £5m increase in Fiserv’s bid with pessimism, but conceded they would likely accept the deal because of a lack of alternatives. Fiserv’s higher bid values Monitise at £75m, just 7.5 per cent of its £1bn valuation in 2014.Paul Mumford, senior investment manager at Cavendish Asset Management, who led the charge against a takeover in June, said Monitise had indicated there were no other potential bidders.“It’s quite disappointing that they haven’t gone for a higher offer . . . I think management should have pushed harder,” he said.“But [they] have thrown in the towel and I don’t want to stand in the way. They feel they can’t progress the company independently.”Mr Mumford said he would withdraw his proxy vote against a takeover by Fiserv if no other bidders emerge. Cavendish owns 112m shares in Monitise.Once considered a pioneer of payments technology in the UK, Monitise has floundered as banks and financial institutions increasingly develop their own software in-house.Since Visa, the card payment company, said in 2014 it would reduce its reliance on the company’s technology and began to sell down its 15 per cent stake, Monitise has issued four sales warnings and seen off two chief executives.Founded by former professional rugby player Alastair Lukies, the company has spent hundreds of millions of pounds developing its technology. But losses have grown as the group has lost clients to larger players. Pre-tax losses for the year to June 2016 rose 7 per cent to £243m and last month, the group warned that revenues next year are likely to decline.
2;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2017-08-07T06:24:06Z;Fiserv and Monitise agree new £75m deal;;Monitise has accepted a new and improved takeover bid from Fiserv, following a shareholder revolt at the British fintech pioneer that looked to have scuppered the deal.Monitise and Fiserve agreed a £70m deal in June, but this immediately drew criticism from shareholders as “too low”, given the tech darling was valued at more than £1bn less than three years ago.Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which owns 112m shares in Monitise, had led the charge against the 2.9p offer after deriding it given the stock peaked at 80p.However, the two companies have now agreed an improved offer of 3.1p per share, valuing the company at £75m. It is also a 35 per cent premium to the Monitise share price before news of a deal first broke. Fiserv said the deal was final and would not be improved, unless a third party submitted a bid.Urging shareholders to accept the new offer, the board of Fiserv pointed out in their press release that “revenue for the [Monitise] continues to decline and outstrip cost-cutting initiatives”, “Monitise’s cash balance continued to decline”, and that the company “has now been in a public offer period since 13 June 2017 without a third party offer or potential offer emerging.”
3;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Fiserv postpones meeting on proposed Monitise takeover;;Fiserv’s takeover of British fintech pioneer Monitise is on shaky ground after an extraordinary general meeting was postponed to buy the US software company more time to convince shareholders to accept its £70m offer.The meeting was due to take place on Tuesday but has been put on ice “in light of the feedback” from certain Monitise shareholders. That sets the clock ticking on the takeover with August 24 the final date for the meeting to take place and shareholders needing two weeks notice. Effectively Fiserv has two weeks to reconvene the meeting and to decide whether to stick with existing offer, raise the bid or walk away.Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which owns 112m shares in Monitise, had led the charge against the 2.9p offer after deriding it as “too low” given the stock peaked at 80p. No other offers have emerged for the former tech darling but there has been little sign that agitated retail investors are willing to accept the bid. The American company has given itself two weeks to corral more support from Monitise shareholders but has not yet chosen to sweeten its offer.Monitise management has continued to recommend the deal having warned of the tough task it faces should Fiserv walk away. The London company has failed to drum up any sales of its FinKit software and could face a fire sale of its assets should the Fiserv bid fail.Monitise were flat at 2.8p. It declined to comment and Fiserv was not immediately available for comment.
4;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2017-06-15T15:24:59Z;Monitise shareholders push back against Fiserv takeover offer;;The proposed £70m takeover of UK fintech company Monitise by Fiserv has already met opposition from shareholders who are angry that the 2.9p-a-share offer price is far below the 80p-per-share peak that valued Monitise at more than £1bn only three years ago.Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which owns 112m shares in Monitise, said he would vote against the offer, which is “too low”. He argued that the value of the technology underpinning Monitise had been distorted by the problems the company has faced over the past two years, as its shares collapsed due to repeated warnings and it struggled to sell any kit.“While the dramatic tale of a once-loved tech company falling from grace makes for good headlines, it obscures the fact that this offer is far too low. While the company clearly got burned in the mobile payments market and failed to live up to its initial promise, its newer FinKIT offering is solid and has real potential. The main barrier to adoption so far has simply been Monitise’s history and size. So a company with the resources of Fiserv could be looking at a real bargain,” he said.The fund manager questioned whether companies like IBM, which works with Monitise, would want to see the company lose its independence.Monitise has an inchoate investor base, with management only controlling a tiny portion and former large shareholders like Visa having sold out.The shares trade at 2.83p, which is below the offer price.
5;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2017-06-13T15:57:50Z;Monitise humbled by £70m sale to Fiserv;‘Grandfather’ of UK fintech sold for fraction of former billion-pound-plus valuation;Monitise, once a favoured UK technology stock with a valuation topping £1bn, has been sold for just £70m, after failing to find buyers for its latest fintech software.Fiserv, the US financial services technology company, will acquire its UK counterpart for a sum only marginally higher than its annual revenue. The 2.9p-a-share offer in cash represents a 26 per cent premium on its closing price on Monday.The offer is far below the 80p level at which Monitise traded in 2014, when it appeared to be on the cusp of becoming a major player in mobile payments technology. The company was then backed by Visa, which had around a 15 per cent stake, and its software was used by dozens of banks — including most of the major British brands. It looked to be on the cusp of leading the “fintech” revolution.However, Visa sold its shares in September 2014 and said it would develop its own in-house mobile payments software. That instigated a downward spiral for Monitise, which issued four separate revenue warnings following the Visa sale. It changed management repeatedly and failed to find a buyer after putting itself up for sale in 2015.The company founded by former professional rugby player Alastair Lukies spent hundreds of millions of pounds building its technology, but failed to turn a meaningful profit. It reported a pre-tax loss of £243m in the year to June 2016, an increase on the £227m it lost the year before.Monitise celebrates its tenth anniversary as a listed company this month. Lee Cameron, who has been with the business since its inception and is currently chief executive, said he had “mixed emotions” about the sale, given the company’s initial success. He argued that the “world caught up” with Monitise, which was viewed as a “grandfather” in the fintech sector competing against well-funded start-ups with exciting products.He also admitted that large banks were reluctant to buy its FinKit technology because of the travails of the past two years. “To be frank, with our tumultuous history we are seen as a small, fragile business with a balance sheet that does not tick the box,” he said.Monitise was working with Fiserv to resell the software before the US company, which was previously linked with a bid for Misys, opted to make an offer.Peter Roe, an analyst with TechMarketView, said Monitise’s technology was sound, but the “toxic history of the Monitise brand” had stalled its progress. “Looking back to the early days, the founding team had a real vision of transformation across banking and e-commerce. Yes, it all went horribly wrong and this denouement is a million miles away from their ambition, but they were surely right to try,” he said.

No valuation was given.“Blockchain technology represents a fundamental, generational shift for financial services, and Chain’s platform is enabling and accelerating this transformation,” said Ramneek Gupta, co-head of global venture investing at Citi Ventures. “We hope to leverage Chain’s platform to rapidly test and develop applications as part of Citi’s multi-faceted blockchain strategy which has the potential to greatly enhance our customers’ experience well beyond just currencies and payments.”Chain’s new investors will also form a working group with the company, which launched just over a year ago, to explore the application of the technology in various markets.Jim Robinson, a former chief executive at American Express, is joining Chain’s board of directors, the company also said on Wednesday.Nasdaq already has said it will use Chain’s blockchain technology to underpin its new private share-trading market, in one of its most high-profile applications to date. Former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer and former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters have also lent their support to start-ups exploring its use.Former Merrill Lynch executive Bob Wigley recently hailed the cost-cutting potential of bitcoin and the technology underpinning the controversial currency.The group’s former head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa called bitcoin a potential “leading global payments system”, saying he had invested an undisclosed amount in Blockchain, a UK-based company that derives its name from the underlying technology, and was now advising the group.Blockchain claims to be the leading supplier of consumer bitcoin “wallets” — software used for receiving and making payments with the currency. Last year, the company raised $30m in funding from investors including Sir Richard Branson, Lightspeed Ventures and Wicklow Capital, which at the time was the largest single funding round by a bitcoin business.

The latest data releases send mixed signals about an economic recovery even as consumer confidence rose sharply.The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index fell 4 per cent against the same month in 2010. The index tracks monthly changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the US.Prices fell in 18 of the 20 cities in December. The index declined 1.1 per cent, but dipped 0.5 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis. Analysts had expected prices to decline by 0.7 per cent. Miami and Phoenix were the only cities to record rises for the month, up 0.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis.On a year-on-year basis, Detroit was the only city where prices rose, up 0.5 per cent. Atlanta had the steepest fall, with prices declining 12.8 per cent compared with December 2010.“In terms of prices, the housing market ended 2011 on a very disappointing note,” said David Blitzer, S&P’s index committee chairman. “While we thought we saw some signs of stabilisation in the middle of 2011, it appears that neither the economy nor consumer confidence was strong enough to move the market in a positive direction as the year ended.”While some analysts believe home prices might have entered into a renewed period of decline, others are adamant that prices will stop falling in the second half of 2012.David Stiff, chief economist at Fiserv, the financial services technology solutions company, said: “Our expectation is that prices will stabilise this summer and there are a number of positives that will put a floor under home prices, including an increase in employment, improvement in consumer confidence and thus home sales. House prices lag home sales data by about nine to 12 months.”Consumer confidence data also released on Tuesday showed a sharp rise in sentiment in February to 70.8, significantly better than the forecast of 64, after the Conference Board’s index dipped in January to 61.1.The Conference Board, which compiles a survey of consumer attitudes on the economy, said that there was big decline in those describing jobs as hard to get, down to 38.7 per cent versus January’s 43.3 per cent. February is the first reading below 40 per cent since November 2008, helped by a rise in employment and optimism for income prospects. The index is measured on a scale of 100 pegged to the level of confidence in 1985.“The index is now close to levels last seen a year ago. Consumers are considerably less pessimistic about current business and labour market conditions than they were in January. And, despite further increases in gas prices, they are more optimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy, job prospects, and their financial situation,” says Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center.Separate figures showed durable goods orders in the US fell sharply in January, in spite of the recent positive reports of an upturn in the manufacturing sector.Orders for long-lasting factory goods fell 4 per cent last month, significantly worse than expected, according to the commerce department. This follows a revised 3.2 per cent jump in December and 4.2 per cent surge in November. Durable goods orders were expected to fall 0.7 per cent month on month in January following the surge of the previous month, after a robust jump in aircraft orders.Transportation equipment orders declined the most after two consecutive months of rises, falling 6.1 per cent.The data, which are seen as volatile compared with other indicators, reflect new orders placed with domestic manufacturers for immediate and future delivery of factory hard goods.“The expiry at the end of last year of the accelerated tax allowances for capital depreciation may have been a bigger factor than we previously thought,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.“It now looks like any gain in business investment in equipment and software in the first quarter will be pretty modest, supporting our view that overall gross domestic product growth will be a modest 1 per cent to 2 per cent annualised,” he added.Analysts were concerned by the 3.2 per cent decline in orders excluding transportation and 4.5 per cent fall in orders, excluding defence.“While a large proportion of this decline is from a 19 per cent month-on-month drop in non-defence aircraft, there is a very steep drop in machinery orders of 10.4 per cent,” said David Semmens, US economist at Standard Chartered.“This is at odds with the ISM and regional surveys which have been promising to say the least, but this is hard data and although the series is volatile the drop in machinery spending is too great to be an anomaly,” he said.Overall shipments increased 0.4 per cent, while capital goods shipments fell 1.1 per cent. Unfilled orders were up 0.5 per cent.Inventories of manufactured durable goods rose by 0.7 per cent last month.
8;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
9;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2011-06-21T15:46:05Z;Approach for Foster’s hits SABMiller’s shares;;London equities found support on Tuesday, with a frisson of bid activity providing some welcome relief from the continuing uncertainty of the Greek debt crisis.SABMiller, the international brewer, fell 3.6 per cent to £21.03 and the bottom of the FTSE 100 after news of its offer for Australian brewer Foster’s.The offer was priced at A$4.90, valuing the target company’s existing share capital at A$9,5bn, ($10m) and a premium of 145 per cent to the share price at June 2, before market speculation of bid interest began. Foster’s rejected the approach, saying it undervalued the company.Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers, said: “Given the tough time that they have experienced in some saturated markets this deal would be a good fit for SAB’s business model.“There is a large cash pile at SAB and there have been no significant acquisitions in the last few years.“Some suggest that keeping a strong balance sheet will be safer, others suggest organic growth will be more beneficial but we feel that the M&A route would enhance shareholder returns to a greater extent.”At the other end of the FTSE 100, Whitbread made the day’s best gain, rising 6.9 per cent to £15.87 after a well-received first-quarter trading update.The owner of Premier Inn budget hotels said strong demand in London helped sales at the chain rise 3 per cent. Like-for-like sales across the group rose 1.7 per cent, with total sales up 9.2 per cent.The numbers were also strong enough to provide wider cheer. InterContinental Hotels rose 2.6 per cent to £11.97.Overall, London’s benchmark index rose 81 points to 5,775.31, a rise of 1.4 per cent. Traders were prepared to buy back into resource stocks after the recent bout of risk aversion looked to have taken the sector too far. Antofagasta rose 5.1 per cent to £12.66, the second-strongest gain on the top tier of the market.But lingering uncertainty about the ability of the political leadership of the eurozone to draw a line under the Greek debt crisis kept gains for financial stocks modest. Lloyds Banking Group rose 0.2 per cent to 47.12p.“Today’s session will be laced with the nervousness surrounding the Greek bail-out yet again,” predicted James Hughes, senior market analyst at online dealer Alpari.“The longer we have no resolution to the problem the more likely we are to see more unpredictable big swings in the markets.”There was also bid activity on the FTSE 250. Misys topped the mid-cap index, rising 8 per cent to 415.1p, after it confirmed receipt of a preliminary bid approach.Bid speculation has surrounded Misys for some time and a number of US companies including Sungard, FIS Global and Fiserv have been suggested as possible bidders. Indian IT services companies such as Infosys and HCL are also possibilities
10;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2011-05-10T19:51:46Z;Vodafone skips Footsie gains ahead of results;;Vodafone missed out on the FTSE 100’s biggest gain in three weeks amid concerns that its results next week might disappoint the market. Its shares were one of only three blue-chip fallers in London as analysts cut numbers.Credit Suisse, Nomura and Exane BNP Paribas all trimmed earnings forecasts by about 3 per cent to reflect competition in Europe.Profit warnings from KPN and Belgacom have pointed to smartphones cannibalising voice usage, suggesting consensus expectations for Vodafone’s margins still need to fall, Nomura said.It cut forecasts to “pre-empt cautious margin guidance” at full-year results next Tuesday.Credit Suisse also predicted that Vodafone Europe would miss forecasts for 2011, though it expected US and Indian operations to compensate.Vodafone ended weaker by 0.3 per cent to 169½p even as all three brokers kept “buy” advice.“We do not see results as a great positive catalyst but believe that consensus is now sufficiently cautious,” said BNP.Strong corporate earnings and gains among the commodity stocks helped lift the wider market, sending the FTSE 100 higher by 76.2 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 6,018.89.A better than expected US performance lifted InterContinental Hotels by 3.9 per cent to £12.98 while Imperial Tobacco gained 3.1 per cent to £22.24 after boosting investor returns.Schroders’ voting shares rose 5.6 per cent to £17.50 after Numis Securities added the fund manager to its “buy” list.Quarterly results last week were disappointing but the stock had fallen to 13 times forward earnings, compared with a historical average of 15.5 times, analyst David McCann said.Reed Elsevier climbed 3.3 per cent to 549½p after it hosted a seminar on its risk information unit, the publisher’s first investor day for four years. The meeting “marked a significant turning point in the company’s communication strategy”, said Credit Suisse.Sage Group rose 3.6 per cent to 296p on talk that the accounting software maker was a takeover target for Oracle or SAP.Dealers doubted the talk and noted that Sage management was on a US investor roadshow this week. But they added that the disposal of Sage’s perennially underperforming US healthcare unit looked more plausible.Misys, which has also been the subject of rumours about a bid or the disposal of a division, added a further 1.4 per cent to 348¼p.Fiserv and SunGard Data Systems would be potential bidders, though they might need more evidence that Misys’ banking unit had been turned round, said analysts.Premier Foods led the mid-cap gainers, up 6.4 per cent to 38¾p, after Citigroup turned positive with a 40p price target.A debt restructuring last October cleaned up the company structure but left investors nonplussed, it said, and added: “We believe that as performance stabilises, the market will be increasingly willing to ascribe a ‘sensible’ valuation to the stock.”EnQuest, the North Sea oil producer, rose 5.2 per cent to 136¾p on news that it had taken majority control of the 26.8m-barrel Crawford oil field.

11;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2010-09-26T19:51:36Z;Basel threat to small business;;Tough rules that require investment banks to hold additional capital against risky assets will hit lending to smaller companies by making it more expensive to securitise loans, bankers and analysts have warned.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision voted two weeks ago to increase the capital banks must hold against future losses from 2 to 7 per cent of their assets adjusted for risk.That headline change understates the effect for banks with large trading books and securitisation businesses because the regulators also approved changes in the way banks calculate risk.JPMorgan became the first bank to disclose the impact when Jamie Dimon, chief executive, disclosed that its risk-weighted assets would rise by close to a quarter from $1,100bn to $1,400bn under the rules.Mr Dimon said JPMorgan had “not not made a loan because of any of this” but did warn that the financial system could react to the rules by increasing the cost of loans for individuals and companies.Research from Morgan Stanley reveals that the big European investment banks will see their risk-weighted assets rise by an average of 24 per cent, with UBS facing a 60 per cent rise and Barclays expecting 44 per cent.“As drafted, securitisations, an important transmission of credit into the US economy, are heavily penalised,” Huw van Steenis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said.One banker described the combined effect of the risk-weighting rules and the higher capital charges as a “hockey stick” that sharply penalises efforts to restart the securitisation market.This would hit lending to riskier borrowers such as small businesses and consumers with less than perfect credit.“It may be inevitable that the cost of providing credit has to go up,” Luigi De Ghenghi, attorney with Davis, Polk & Wardwell, said.Some industry experts hope national regulators that apply the rules will make adjustments to the risk weighting.“I cannot see France or Germany signing up for something that will make [small and medium-sized business] lending more difficult,” Suresh Sankaran, who heads strategic risk consulting at Fiserv, said.“The regulators will have to moderate it.”Regulators counter that banks can reduce the sharply higher capital charges by doing more detailed risk assessments or by cutting back on trading.“Nothing has changed in the treatment of small business lending,” one regulator said.“What has changed is the weighting of their capital markets operations, and if they are too risky, they should de-risk them.”

The S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,472.20 while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.9 per cent higher at 2,575.98The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent at 13,463.33. The gains added to Wednesday’s strong last-minute rally which took place amid near-record trading volumes on most equity and derivatives exchanges.Solid earnings from Nokia sent shares in the mobile phone maker 8.8 per cent higher at $30.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.Viacom reported higher revenues and a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, aided by strong DVD sales and the success of the hit film Shrek The Third. Its shares gained 1.9 per cent at $38.50. These results came closely on the heels of strong figures from Walt Disney and Starbucks after Wednesday’s market close.Walt Disney reported a rise in quarterly profit, lifted by strength in its TV and theme park businesses. Shares in the group rose
1.6 per cent to $34.36.Starbucks also posted higher profit and sales. Its shares rose 2.9 percent to as high as $28.00, though by late morning they were down 0.2 percent at $27.15 on the Nasdaq.Eastman Kodak swung to a profit, helped by continued cost-cutting efforts and a hefty gain from the sale of its healthcare group. It rose 5.4 per cent to $26.93.CVS Caremarkrose 3.5 per cent to $36.79 after the company said its second-quarter net income more than doubled in its first full quarter as a combined company.However, the market remained pre-occupied with subprime-related issues as mortgage lender Accredited Home Lenders said it was not certain it would continue to operate due to the adverse conditions in the subprime mortgage market. AHL shares plunged 35.32 per cent to $5.31.Analysts cautioned that stock markets were likely to continue to display significant volatility. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said the CBOE’s Vix index of market volatility had retreated from Wednesday’s peak of 26.22 as investors braced for “peak-
selling”.“Although a sense of calm returned as the Dow rang up a 1.1 per cent gain [on Wednesday], the Vix remains notably elevated and is now set to close above a value of 20 for the sixth straight session,” Mr Wilkinson said.“Judging by the fact that the Vix is lower by 9.6 per cent today [on Thursday], while index values are mixed, makes it hard to tell whether investors are stepping back or adding new positions,” he added.NYSE Euronext shares fell 2.7 per cent to $74.91 after the transatlantic stock exchange reported a rise in second quarter earnings.The earnings report reflected the first time that the pan-European exchange Euronext, which was bought by the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year, contributed to earnings.In deals news, financial data processor Fiserv said it would acquire the electronic payment processing company Checkfree for $4.4bn in cash, soothing recent concerns that dealmaking would wane on Wall Street amid credit market troubles.

13;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2006-10-16T14:21:10Z;Misys names Lawrie as new chief;;Misys has named Mike Lawrie, a veteran of the software and IT industry, as its new chief executive.The appointment follows the collapse of takeover talks and the departure of Kevin Lomax, chief executive and co-founder of the UK software company, earlier this month.Mr Lawrie spent 27 years with IBM, where he rose to become senior vice-president and group executive of sales and distribution. Most recently he was a partner with ValueAct Capital, a private investment firm based in San Francisco, after a stint as chief executive of Siebel Systems, the international software company. He was ousted from Siebel after a year in charge in April 2005.Mr Lawrie said in a statement he was excited to be taking on the “challenge of returning Misys to levels of sustained growth and success”.Sir Dominic Cadbury, chairman, said: “His significant experience of refocusing international organisations and driving operational excellence across complex businesses will be invaluable to take Misys forward.”Sir Dominic has been under fire from shareholders for not securing a deal from General Atlantic and Permira, the private equity firms that were the last potential bidders after the withdrawal of SunGard and Fiserv, two US trade buyers.Sir Dominic, who led the sales process, said he had held meetings with a rival “management walk-in” team comprising Ross Graham, John Sussens and Mike O’Leary, three fomer Misys directors. Takeover talks began in June, when Mr Lomax expressed an interset in taking Misys private.Investors have been keen to see the arrival of a high quality successor to Mr Lomax.Mr Lomax enjoyed mixed fortunes as chief executive of the company which he helped found in 1979, with a stellar rise in the dotcom boom and a series of profit warnings afterwards. He remains a significant shareholder.Shares in Misys were up 2.5 per cent following the news, at 194½p, by mid afternoon.
14;FISV;Fiserv Inc;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Fiserv steps back from expressing interest in Misys;;Fiserv has become the second company to drop its interest in Misys, the banking and healthcare software group.The US technology group conducted due diligence when the UK group agreed to open its books in July to parties interested in buying the business.However, Fiserv is understood to have had reservations about integrating Misys’s banking unit into its own operations.It also had little interest in the UK group’s healthcare software business.Fiserv joined the consortium led by Silver Lake Partners, a specialist technology investor, and including Sungard Data Systems, the US financial data group, in dropping its interest.Fiserv was also believed to be part of the “various” parties that Misys referred to in its statement to the market last week.However, a person familiar with the situation said that Misys was still talking to more than one party.The independent board of Misys is believed to be holding out for an offer in the region of 260p to 265p a share but approaches have fallen short of their valuation.An approach led by Kevin Lomax, founding investor and chief executive, in partnership with General Atlantic and Permira, the private equity groups, is believed to be unwilling to offer more than 255p per share.Misys is hoping to have the issue resolved before the group’s annual meeting on October 4, when Mr Lomax is standing for re-election as a director.Misys set up an independent committee, chaired by Sir Dominic Cadbury, to consider takeover approaches in June.However, last week’s announcement that there was no guarantee of a formal offer on terms that the committee was prepared to accept saw the shares drop 10 per cent on fears that a takeover would not materialise.Two shareholders, who preferred not to be identified and together own about 5 per cent of Misys’s equity, have indicated to the Financial Times that they would be prepared to accept an offer of about 255p per share.On Friday, shares in Misys closed down 1¼p at 230¾p.
