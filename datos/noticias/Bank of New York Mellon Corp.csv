He also did a stint as chief risk officer and led BNY’s clearing, markets and client management division until 2019.BNY missed analysts' expectations in the fourth quarter, as interest revenue fell 8 per cent on lower interest rates; at the time, Mr Gibbons said the bank was “intensely focused on carefully managing costs”.Mr Gibbons was appointed after a “comprehensive search process”, said Joseph Echevarria, BNY’s chairman. Mr Echevarria said Mr Gibbons performed “exceptionally well” in the interim role."

RWC has not struck a deal to transfer the team’s existing assets to its organisation.The appointments are a boon for newly independent RWC, which last year bought back a stake in itself previously owned by Schroders.Across the City, investment managers are becoming frustrated that they don’t have access to the resources they need to actively manage moneyThe FTSE 100 group purchased a 49 per cent holding in 2010 and maintained close links with the boutique until disposing of its stake last year. Peter Harrison left RWC in 2013 to become Schroders chief executive and was RWC chairman until 2016.RWC is now owned by its management, alongside US investment group Lincoln Peak Capital, which holds a 27 per cent stake.Dan Mannix, chief executive of RWC, said that his company’s independent structure and boutique culture were “a significant component” of the Newton managers’ decision to join.He declined to comment on Mr Clay’s reasons for leaving BNY Mellon, where he had worked for 20 years. However, he said that independent boutiques such as RWC were able to give portfolio managers the freedom and investment to do their job in a way that fund groups owned by large companies could not.“Across the City, investment managers are becoming increasingly frustrated that they don’t have access to the resources they need to actively manage money,” said Mr Mannix.He pointed to a “divergence” in the interests of asset managers’ shareholders and those of their portfolio managers and investors.Managers that were bound to annual profit targets set by shareholders were forced to embark on cost cutting or corporate upheaval, such as mergers and acquisitions, which was “distracting” for their investment staff and risked compromising returns, he said.Mr Mannix added that RWC’s structure allowed it to “focus on the long term” and provide its investment professionals with “commitment and stability”.Sign up to the weekly FTfm newsletter and receive the best of the FT’s asset management coverage delivered to your inbox every Monday morning.Sign up here with one clickInvestment team liftouts are common in asset management and enable their new employers to bring on board professionals with a proven record of working together without resorting to M&A.BNY Mellon has appointed Ilga Haubelt, who recently joined Newton as head of equity opportunities, to take over the management of Mr Clay’s fund.The US investment group, which operates a multi-boutique structure, acquired London-based equity specialist Newton in 1998. Mr Clay’s fund is one of Newton’s best performers, delivering higher returns than its peers over one, three and five years.Newton hit the headlines last year when the City regulator fined one of its UK equity managers for breaching competition law. Paul Stephany, who was later dismissed, was found to have encouraged 14 rivals to cap their orders for shares in an initial public offering. Newton escaped a fine after assisting the watchdog with its probe.** The article has been updated to clarify the reason for the FCA fine.
2;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BNY Mellon steps in to support money market fund after outflows;Bank swaps $1.2bn of assets for cash to cover redemptions at Dreyfus Cash Management fund;BNY Mellon stepped in to support one of its money market funds amid sharp outflows from parts of the sector this week, buying $1.2bn of the fund’s assets so it had cash to help cover redemptions.The US bank made the liquidity injection as investors withdrew $6bn from the Dreyfus Cash Management fund in the week ending Thursday, around half of its assets, according to Crane Data.The fund is a “prime” money market fund that invests in short-term corporate debt, including commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Outflows from these funds have heaped pressure on short-term funding markets as concern about coronavirus has grown, sending borrowing costs higher for companies and US municipalities and prompting a series of interventions from the Federal Reserve.Investors have shifted instead to the safety of money market funds that invest only in short-term government debt, which are used as a proxy for cash.BNY Mellon’s move to take $1.2bn of short-term debt held by the Dreyfus fund on to its own balance sheet came after outflows dragged the fund’s assets close to an important liquidity threshold. If prime money market funds’ so-called weekly liquidity falls below 30 per cent, they are allowed to impose restrictions on investors withdrawing funds, including added fees — something that severely crimps the fund’s attractiveness to investors.“Given the current challenging market environment, money market investors are moving out of prime funds that include commercial debt . . . and into government or Treasury funds,” BNY Mellon said in a statement explaining its support for the Dreyfus fund.Its action was first reported by Ignites, a Financial Times news service.“It tells you that the stresses are very acute,” said Mark Cabana, an interest rate strategist at Bank of America. “It tells you that money market funds are under severe stress due to the lack of liquidity in markets and it tells you that all the programs that the Fed is setting up are very much needed.”The Fed’s interventions to stabilise markets this week included a lending facility to backstop money markets, which it announced on Wednesday and expanded on Friday.After a run on money market funds in the days after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, the sector was split into two buckets — ultra-safe funds that invest only in short-term government debt and a smaller category of “prime” funds that invest in both sovereign debt and short-term commercial paper and bank credit deposits, which offer slightly higher yields but whose value may fluctuate.Prime funds suffered $85bn in outflows for the week ending Wednesday, while government debt money market funds attracted $249bn, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. Government funds now have assets totalling $2.75tn, compared with $798bn in prime funds.Outflows from prime funds should begin to reverse once the monetary and fiscal support from the Federal Reserve works its way into the financial system, Mr Crane said. “Outflows have been slowing in the last few days. As long as outflows don’t accelerate, [prime funds] should be able to handle it.”Additional reporting by Joe Rennison
3;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-02-24T05:00:27Z;BlackRock’s black box: the technology hub of modern finance;Used by rival fund managers, the reach of the Aladdin platform raises possible conflicts of interest;As toxic mortgage-backed securities tore through the financial system more than a decade ago, the US government turned to Larry Fink, one of their earliest pioneers, for help. Mr Fink made a fortune packaging mortgages together and selling off slices of the combined pools in the 1980s before founding BlackRock, which today stands as the world’s largest asset manager.As the crisis deepened, Mr Fink spoke to Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, more often than some chief executives of the big Wall Street banks, in brief, urgent calls. He offered the Treasury and Federal Reserve a powerful tool to gauge risk in the assets at the centre of the havoc. The arrangement would net BlackRock tens of millions of dollars in government contracts, awarded largely without a tender process, put it at the forefront of the fintech revolution and cement Mr Fink’s standing at the intersection of politics and finance.At the heart of this exchange was Aladdin, BlackRock’s vast technology platform. The system links investors to the markets, ensures portfolios hold the right assets and measures risk in the world’s stocks, bonds and derivatives, currencies and private equity.Aladdin’s influence has surged since the financial crisis. Today, it acts as the central nervous system for many of the largest players in the investment management industry — and, as the Financial Times has discovered, for several huge non-financial companies.Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors, the largest fund managers after BlackRock, are users, as are half the top 10 insurers by assets, as well as Japan’s $1.5tn government pension fund, the world’s largest. Apple, Microsoft and Google’s parent firm, Alphabet — the three biggest US public companies — all rely on the system to steward hundreds of billions of dollars in their corporate treasury investment portfolios.Yet the true reach of Aladdin is unknown outside of BlackRock. The New York-based manager last revealed exactly how much of the world’s assets sit on the system in February 2017, when they reached $20tn. BlackRock told the FT that total assets do not reflect how clients use the system. One former employee says the figure is no longer disclosed because of the negative attention the enormous sums attracted. In the past three years, Aladdin has added scores of new clients, the stock market has gained a third in value and the bond market is 13 per cent larger.Today, $21.6tn sits on the platform from just a third of its 240 clients, according to public documents verified with the companies and first-hand accounts. That figure alone is equivalent to 10 per cent of global stocks and bonds.“Aladdin has become a mainstay of the marketplace,” says Peter Kraus, chief executive of Aperture Investors and former head of AllianceBernstein, the $600bn investment group. “It has a huge historic client base.”Aladdin has fuelled BlackRock’s all-conquering rise by tightening its links with customers and diversifying its revenues. But the platform’s success has opened up new challenges. Competitors are fast developing rival platforms that are taking some of its business. The system’s scale — unparalleled for technology offered by a fund manager — has also created possible conflicts of interest. Most of all, its importance as a fintech hub has raised the prospect of a regulatory backlash.The world’s most powerful risk management system threatens to become a liability for its owner.After the financial crisis, a US regulatory push sought to label certain large banks and insurers as systemically important. Asset managers were expected to be included in this list, but the larger companies lobbied hard to avoid the outcome. They were ultimately successful, based on one single argument — investors who entrust fund managers with their assets technically hold them with one of a small group of specialist banks, so the assets are never on fund managers’ balance sheets.Platforms like Aladdin were not factored into the ruling, but as markets and investing become more reliant on technology the functions of these systems could play a role in future decisions.“Regulators will have to confront this issue as technology becomes more important and intertwined with the investment process,” says Monica Summerville, director of fintech research for Tabb Group, a consultancy. “They are going to have to take a stand.”Aladdin’s sprawling influence has prompted fears that it, or BlackRock, could act as a chokepoint if either faced a shock — a cyber attack, a rogue line of code or a sudden crisis for the company — destabilising the financial system.In January, the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, said the failure of a large portfolio and risk system, like Aladdin, “could cause serious consumer harm” or even “damage market integrity”.“The industry is becoming reliant on a small number of players such as Aladdin,” says Jon Little, former head of BNY Mellon’s international asset management business. “Yet [regulators] seem reluctant to regulate or intervene to supervise these key service providers directly.”Though Aladdin does not tell asset managers what to buy or sell, some argue that if a large portion of global assets respond to the warnings that Aladdin gives off, trillions of dollars will react to events — such as the outbreak of a pandemic or war in the Middle East — in the same way, causing dangerous herding behaviour. The more investment managers and asset owners rely on Aladdin to gauge risk, the less responsible they become for their portfolio decisions.This concern was highlighted by the Los Angeles County Employees’ Retirement Association, the $58bn US pension fund, in January. It cited the potential for “groupthink” as one reason it declined Aladdin’s risk capabilities.“Anything close to an oligopoly in risk management would be especially dangerous if there were any weakness in the system,” says Jim McCaughan, former chief executive of Principal Global Investors, the $476bn fund manager.Aladdin’s critical role within high-profile companies also makes it a prime target for cyber crime. Ryan Dodd, a former fund manager and founder of risk consultant Cyberhedge, says BlackRock and Aladdin are enticing targets for hackers, including those backed by nation states. “They provide a master key to unlock credentials of thousands of other high-value targets, such as the users of Aladdin,” he says.These risks are compounded by Aladdin’s complexity. Moving on and off the system can take years, because it often entails replacing a range of different systems and users have to contort the way they operate to fit Aladdin’s model. One recent client whose business transitioned to Aladdin over three years likened the process to “changing a tyre while speeding round a racetrack”.Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer for BlackRock, says Aladdin’s risk tools are designed to support, rather than replace, portfolio managers, adding that rival platforms offer an alternative, negating the idea the financial system was overly reliant on Aladdin.“Even though it’s a critical piece of infrastructure, there are many critical pieces of infrastructures that clients have in their inner workings,” Mr Goldstein says. “We live in an incredibly competitive environment.”The scale of BlackRock’s dominance in both the investment industry and in providing its plumbing has led to potential conflicts of interest. As the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock is among the top shareholders of most listed companies globally, including many Aladdin clients.BlackRock is the largest shareholder of Santander, for example, whose asset management unit joined the platform last year, and a major shareholder of HSBC and Credit Suisse, other recent clients. This has drawn concern from rivals that BlackRock’s influence over the companies as a major investor has helped convince them to choose Aladdin, an idea BlackRock rejects.In some cases, the potential conflicts are multi-layered. BlackRock is the third-largest shareholder in Apple, giving it clout over the tech company’s shareholder votes, while Sue Wagner, a co-founder of the fund manager, is a board member of both companies.Ms Wagner is also on the board of Swiss Re, another Aladdin client whose former vice-chairman, Mathis Cabiallavetta, is a BlackRock board member. Mark Wilson, former chief executive of Aviva, which uses Aladdin, accepted a seat on BlackRock’s board in 2018 while in his former role. This decision angered the UK insurer’s shareholders who worried it created a conflict of interest, as Aviva’s investment arm competes with BlackRock. He left Aviva six months later and remains on BlackRock’s board.Aladdin — which stands for asset, liability, debt and derivative investment network — began as a simple ledger for bond portfolios shortly after BlackRock was founded in 1988. As it grew, BlackRock extended its use for certain clients. The first was General Electric, which in 1994 was selling Kidder Peabody, the beleaguered brokerage, but was unsure how to price the assets on its balance sheet. A series of similar one-off arrangements eventually led BlackRock to offer Aladdin as a product in 2000.“When we did Kidder Peabody, it was an X-ray machine,” says Mr Goldstein. “When we had the opportunity to work on the most recent [financial] crisis, it was an MRI machine.”The system has expanded rapidly. BlackRock’s 2015 deal to acquire FutureAdvisor spawned an offshoot of the platform for financial advisers today used by Morgan Stanley and UBS. BlackRock also offers a version of Aladdin for custody banks, including BNY Mellon, that safeguard assets managed by fund groups like BlackRock. Last year, BlackRock acquired eFront, a private equity tech platform, for $1.3bn, extending Aladdin’s reach into less liquid assets.Powerful trends have buffeted Aladdin’s rise. Investing has become more electronic and reliant on big data. As the tools that process the information have become more complex, investors, fund managers and insurers have turned to larger platforms such as Aladdin to replace multiple specialised systems.Aladdin’s growth is reflected on BlackRock’s balance sheet. Technology revenue, dominated by Aladdin, hit $974m last year, just 7 per cent of the company’s total, but among the firm’s fastest growing areas. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict this revenue will more than double in the next six years.Mr Fink has said he wants a third of BlackRock revenue to come from technology by 2022. This includes money from Aladdin but also fees from funds that clients select on the platform. The company offers discounts to institutions that invest in BlackRock funds and sign up to Aladdin.Aladdin’s income, locked up in steady, multiyear contracts, diversifies BlackRock’s income away from the fees it charges on assets, which dip during a market downturn.“It’s the tech subscription model that investors love,” says Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones. “It’s not sensitive to the market.”Aladdin’s dominance has attracted heightened competition. State Street, which runs $3tn of assets, bought Charles River, a popular platform for fund managers, for $2.6bn in 2018. It has since signed up four new clients, including Lazard Asset Management.Dimension, a platform from Copenhagen-based SimCorp, has also won a series of US clients, including the World Bank, and has a stable of European users, such as the investment units of Axa and UBS.In January, MSCI, an analytics provider, paid $190m for a minority stake in Burgiss Group, which specialises in private asset data. The deal is a direct response to Aladdin’s push beyond stocks and bonds.So far, BlackRock has conceded little ground to competitors, despite some offering cheaper and more flexible terms. Just one big client has publicly defected so far, the Italian fund house Pioneer when it was bought by Amundi, the €1.6tn French manager.“We chose to have complete control of our software,” says Yves Perrier, chief executive of Amundi, Europe’s biggest investment group. “I don’t want to be dependent on a competitor.”In 1986, Larry Fink led the mortgage department of First Boston, a large investment bank, and was on track to become its chief executive. Then, he lost $100m and was soon pushed out. Mr Fink had joined a decade earlier as a graduate trainee and rose rapidly. He generated hundreds of millions of dollars in part by selling mortgage-backed securities, but then made a fateful error. He misjudged a fall in interest rates, which allow mortgages to be repaid quicker, reducing their value to investors.The tale has become an origin story for Mr Fink’s second act at BlackRock and the genesis of its risk platform, Aladdin. But he leaves out one crucial detail.The scale of the loss was driven by his desire to beat his counterpart at Salomon Brothers, Lewis Ranieri. Mr Ranieri was later immortalised as a “big swinging dick” by Michael Lewis in Liar’s Poker, and was aggressively selling mortgage-backed securities. As the rivalry deepened, Mr Fink issued more than First Boston could sell, ending up with a large inventory on its balance sheet that would lose value when rates fell.For Mr Fink the episode proved the need for a portfolio management tool like Aladdin to assess risk. It also reveals the competitive drive behind Mr Fink and the group of First Boston colleagues who left to found BlackRock, many of whom remain today.“These are dynamite business people,” says one former First Boston colleague. “They can smell blood up the river.”
4;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2019-11-23T11:00:43Z;Absolute return funds suffer £15bn of outflows;Once popular products are now UK’s worst selling funds group after chronic underperformance  ;UK funds that promised retail investors positive returns in all markets have been hit by a tide of redemptions, having once been feted as the ideal product for wary savers scarred by the financial crisis.Absolute return funds, which use a range of assets and derivatives, were promoted on the promise of a set level of returns above cash, in exchange for higher fees than standard equity funds. But after several years of failing to deliver, they have become the worst selling fund group in the UK with £15bn of net outflows over the past 12 months, according to Morningstar data.“The sector saw an extended period of underperformance from late December last year to June 2019,” said Charles Younes, research manager at FE Investments. “Many of these funds did not have enough protection on the downturn, which made periods of negative performance stand out even more.”The best-known in the category, Standard Life Aberdeen’s Global Absolute Return Strategies, or Gars, was once Europe’s largest investment vehicle. But its assets have shrunk from £13.7bn to £6.1bn in the past year.Three years ago the UK Gars fund managed more than £26bn, while the overall strategy — including a Luxembourg version and segregated mandates — had €60bn (£51bn) of assets. Persistent outflows have dogged the £11bn merger in 2017 of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management.SLA changed the Gars manager from Guy Stern to Aymeric Forest in February, but the move has failed to quell outflows, which totalled £8.2bn over the past 12 months.The company said performance had improved under Mr Forest and that returns were less volatile than equities.“Existing clients noted this improvement has persisted and have started to increase their investments,” SLA said. “It will naturally take longer for those not currently invested to be aware of these improvements and to be attracted to the fund.”Several of the other biggest absolute return funds in the UK market have also suffered heavy outflows. Invesco’s Global Targeted Returns fund dropped by a fifth in that period to £9.9bn having suffered £2.5bn of outflows. BNY Mellon’s Real Return fund also shrunk by a fifth to £6.4bn, mainly due to £2.3bn of outflows.Clive Emery, multi asset portfolio strategist at Invesco, said the fund had suffered 18 months of poor performance up to last December, but over the past 12 months it had achieved a gross cash plus 5 per cent return. “We expect this recovery in performance, combined with the fund’s positive performance during the market sell-offs in December 2018 and May of this year, to give investors renewed confidence in the strategy,” he said.BNY Mellon said its strategy had performed strongly in absolute terms, but its UK fund had “not been immune to the more jaded perception of diversified growth funds, with some assets being reallocated into different areas”.It added: “The picture overseas is somewhat different, where the strategy is less mature and investors adopt a slightly varied perspective.”Two Aviva Investors absolute return funds have also suffered in the past year. The UK Aviva Investors Multi-Strategy (Aims) Target Return fund has dropped a fifth to £4.3bn due to £1bn of outflows, while the UK Aims Target Income fund fell a quarter to £1.2bn, having bled £500m.The funds were launched by Euan Munro, chief executive of Aviva Investors, in 2014 after he moved from SLA, where he had been the architect of Gars.Aviva Investors said it had hired several fund managers to its Aims teams last year. This led to an 8.5 per cent return for the Target Return fund and 10.5 per cent return for the Target Income fund so far in 2019.“While we experienced outflows earlier in the year, we continue to see interest from new and existing clients and this is translating into an improved outlook for future flows,” it said.
5;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2019-10-24T14:25:42Z;William Fouse, quantitative analyst, 1928-2019;‘Father of the index fund’ who co-founded Mellon Capital Management;Today, computers are ubiquitous on Wall Street. Few have done more to make this so than William Fouse, one of the finance industry’s original “quants” and an inventor of the index fund.At Wells Fargo in the 1970s, Fouse, who has died aged 91, was instrumental in launching the first ever passive investment fund, a groundbreaking development that continues to reverberate through the investment industry. The Wells Fargo fund unit that Fouse helped shape, and ultimately lead, is now the crown jewel of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager. He went on to co-found Mellon Capital Management in 1983, which is now a $521bn investment group owned by Bank of New York Mellon.At the heart of his career was rigorous, dispassionate application of data to the investment process. “Our industry has drifted to a point close to conceptual and logical bankruptcy,” he told a conference in Wells Fargo’s heyday, according to a 1980 article in Institutional Investor, the industry’s bible. “I, for one, cannot be happy as a virtually helpless actor in a theatre of the absurd.”When it comes to integrating the ideas of academia with the practical realities of managing money, Fouse has few equals, according to Thomas Loeb, his colleague over more than 40 years at Wells Fargo and Mellon. “In the world of investing, I’d say he’s right up there,” he said. “He was a really unusual guy”.There was little in Fouse’s earlier years that indicated he would go on to be one of the finance industry’s leading quants, before that term for quantitative analysts would even be coined.William Fouse was born on September 20 1928, and helped pay for degrees in industrial administration and business administration from the University of Kentucky by playing jazz clarinet and saxophone. He joined the trust department of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, slowly moving up the ranks to become assistant director of investment research, a “bastion of orthodoxy in its purest form”, according to Peter Bernstein, the financial historian.Yet despite the impression cut by his chubby figure and drooping moustache, Fouse was no orthodox thinker. He became entranced with the mass of groundbreaking financial research that was coming out of academia at the time, and hired IBM consultants to analyse the stock market and measure the performance of Mellon’s money managers. The results were unnerving.In early 1970, he therefore pitched the idea of a fund that would merely try to mimic the US stock market to the head of Mellon’s trust department, but the reception was frosty. “He accused me of trying to turn his job into a science,” Fouse recalled to the Financial Times last year. “So I fled.”He picked up the phone and called an acquaintance, John McQuown, who was working at Wells Fargo, attempting to implement many of the then zany ideas being churned out by an all-star cast of economists, such as Harry Markowitz, Bill Sharpe, Merton Miller and Eugene Fama. The arrival of the affable Kentuckian was fortuitous. Wells Fargo was in discussion with Samsonite’s pension fund about creating something akin to Fouse’s proposal to Mellon. And on July 1 1971, the first passive investment fund went live with $6m — and the era of index funds began in earnest.An array of other innovative products followed, all based on academic ideas, exhaustive research, computer calculations and systematic implementation rather than gut feeling — presaging the swelling quantitative investing trend now sweeping through markets.Perhaps nothing sums up Fouse as well as Institutional Investor’s 1980 cover story in which the bespectacled Fouse smilingly embraces a Prime computer. At the time, the Wells Fargo folks were seen as madmen. “It was a hotbed of investment radicalism,” Mr Loeb recalls. “The guild was very unhappy with us when we spoke at conferences.”Fouse ended up leading the bank’s trust department. But mounting budget battles with the bank led him and Mr Loeb to defect to Mellon and set up Mellon Capital Management in 1983, continuing Fouse’s life-long quest for the optimal way of managing money.There he remained until retiring in 2014, when he became chairman emeritus. Despite a bevy of accolades, he remained little known outside a narrow group of financial geeks, but he lived to see his beloved computers and scientific approach slowly conquer the business of money management.“He believed it was about quality not quantity when it came to living,” Mr Loeb said. Luckily, with nine decades of life largely spent reshaping investing for the better, Fouse enjoyed both.Robin Wigglesworth
6;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2019-07-24T04:00:28Z;KPMG fined £5m over ‘exceptional’ breach in BNY Mellon audit;FRC had called for record penalty of £12.5m over botched reports;KPMG has been handed a £5m fine for misconduct in work for BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, over breaches that were described as “truly exceptional” by regulators.The fine was awarded by an independent disciplinary tribunal and is due to be announced this week, according to two people familiar with the matter, dealing another blow to the reputation of the Big Four accounting firm.The sanction, which follows an investigation from the UK Financial Reporting Council, brings the total fines levied on KPMG in UK to about £20m since June 2018. That is more than the FRC imposed in fines on the entire accounting industry last year.However, the size of the fine will also disappoint the FRC, the audit watchdog, which had called for KPMG to be fined a record £12.5m over the botched reports. KPMG may also be granted a discount from the headline amount for admitting misconduct.KPMG and the FRC declined to comment.The FRC said at a tribunal hearing in May that KPMG had “defeated” the British regulatory system by signing off BNY Mellon reports between 2007 and 2011 that failed to comply with rules on safeguarding client assets during the financial crisis.The case related to work done by KPMG on reports that were submitted to the UK financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. These reports detailed how the US group complied with rules on safeguarding around £1tn of client assets.KPMG and one of its employees admitted they had acted improperly but lawyers for the firm attacked the FRC’s proposed penalty as “extravagant” and “gargantuan” at the disciplinary tribunal hearing in May. They argued the fine should be no more than £1.4m as the misconduct was unintentional and none of BNY Mellon’s clients had lost money or assets as a result.The size of the fine was decided by the tribunal after a three-day hearing. The largest sanction imposed by the FRC to date is the £6.5m penalty PwC paid last year for misconduct in its audit of department store chain BHS.The FRC said errors by KPMG when checking whether BNY Mellon had complied with rules on properly segregating client assets left customers and the broader financial system exposed to risk in the event of the bank’s failure. The watchdog also accused KPMG of “misinforming” regulators over BNY Mellon’s compliance with the rules on safeguarding client assets.BNY Mellon was itself fined a record £126m by the FCA in 2015 for failing to comply with rules that required it to properly ringfence customer accounts at its London branch and in its international unit between 2007 and 2013.KPMG has already been fined twice this year, receiving a £5m penalty for “failing to exercise sufficient professional scepticism” during a 2009 audit of the Co-op Bank, and a £6m penalty for a failed audit of motor insurer Equity Red Star. In 2018, it received a fine of £2m over its work for retailer Ted Baker and a £3m fine relating to its work for insurance software firm Quindell.The accounting giant is also under investigation by the FRC for its work at collapsed government contractor Carillion, which was audited by the firm for 19 years, and has been hit by scandals in the US and South Africa.
7;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2019-07-17T12:05:04Z;BNY Mellon results hit by tepid markets and negative yield curve;Trust bank says it contended with ‘difficult operating environment’ in second quarter;Bank of New York Mellon continued to battle a “difficult operating environment” in its second quarter, characterised by a negative yield curve, low levels of market volatility and a stronger dollar.The tough conditions combined to see revenue and earnings at the world’s biggest custodian bank fall compared with a year ago, although its assets under custody increased.“The impact of the level and shape of the yield curve, as well as continued low levels of volatility and muted market activity, negatively impacted our results”, Charlie Scharf, chief executive, said.The so-called yield curve turned negative this year, meaning long-term borrowing rates are lower than short-term ones. That represents tougher profit conditions for banks, which make money by borrowing short and lending long.For the three months ended June 30, total revenue fell 5 per cent from a year ago to $3.9bn, which was in line with the median forecast among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The bank pinned the decline in revenue on factors including assets under management outflows since last year, a stronger US dollar and a drop in foreign exchange and securities lending revenue.That filtered down to a 2 per cent decline in earnings from a year ago to $1.01 a diluted share, which was six cents ahead of Wall Street forecasts.In BNY Mellon’s investment services business, assets under custody were 6 per cent higher than 12 months ago to $35.5tn, while in investment management its assets under management rose 2 per cent from a year ago to $1.8tn.Bright spots for the bank in the quarter included a decline in expenses, higher fees in its issuer services division, growth in clearance volumes and collateral management, as well as an increase in client assets and volumes in its financial solutions business, Pershing.BNY Mellon shares were down 0.1 per cent in pre-market trade on Wednesday morning. Three months ago, shares staged a hefty drop after the bank gave a disappointing outlook at its first-quarter results.
8;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2019-05-09T11:41:21Z;Wall Street’s safe bet on trust banks turns sour;State Street and BNY Mellon are getting squeezed as investor clients seek lower fees;"Until recently, the big US trust banks were Wall Street’s idea of a safe bet.The likes of State Street and Bank of New York Mellon have long been the irreplaceable plumbing of the financial system, earning steady fee income by providing back-office services for investors. For years, they traded at wide premiums to their better-known and more risk-taking competitors in banking.But times have changed for State Street and BNY Mellon. Their core business of global custody — executing, settling and clearing trades, custody of securities and so on — is coming under pressure as customers seek lower fees for services and higher yields on deposits, and the more diversified JPMorgan Chase gains market share.In the first quarter, fee revenue from investor clients was down 8 per cent in aggregate at State Street and BNY Mellon. Over the past three months, shares in the two banks have underperformed bank indices by roughly 10 percentage points. In the 52 weeks to Thursday, State Street shares were off 35 per cent, while BNY Mellon stock had fallen 14 per cent.“The revenue yield they earn on assets under administration keeps going down,” said Jeffrey Harte, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, adding that he finds it hard to get excited about companies facing “continual pricing pressure in their core business”.The underlying problem for the trust banks is that their customers are struggling to deal with the rise of low-fee passive investment strategies. Money managers pay the trusts a tiny fraction of a percentage point on the assets moved or held, but as the managers’ margins are squeezed, they have pressed the trusts for ever-lower fees.In its first-quarter calls with analysts, State Street, which is the most exposed to the big asset managers that are suffering acute margin pressure, said it “continue[d] to see the ongoing impact of fee concessions”. BNY attributed soft fee income more to reduced client activity and a stronger dollar.One longtime investor in BNY Mellon said the trust banks boast “wonderful returns on equity and offer an incredible service at a very low price — we’re talking 1 basis point — but the thing I get agitated by is why they can’t have more pricing discipline”.JPMorgan has added to the pressure, drawing on its markets expertise to help clients with performance measurement and complex derivates portfolios. The bank won $1tn of custody assets from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in 2017, and it increased custody fees faster than State Street or BNY Mellon last year.“We have had a multiyear investment programme in securities services technology,” said Teresa Heitsenrether, who leads the business for JPMorgan. “The combination of technology investments and operational knowhow has certainly contributed to our share growth.”At the same time, the end of the Federal Reserve’s rate-raising cycle poses particular problems for the trust banks. The general problem is that yields on loans and bonds stop increasing while deposit rates, which tend to lag behind, continue to rise. The effect is pronounced at the trust banks as they have few if any sticky retail deposits. Their institutional clients care about the last basis point.The situation is more acute still because the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet. When the Fed was buying Treasuries as part of its quantitative easing programme, it pushed cash into the hands of investors, and some of that cash ended up parked, interest-free, at trust banks. As the Fed has shrunk its balance sheet — quantitative tightening — the opposite has happened, draining the trusts’ balance sheets of cheap funding.The net result: interest-free deposits at State Street, BNY and Northern Trust, a smaller trust bank, have fallen by a whopping 28 per cent, or $44bn, in the past 12 months.“With QE you had a massive influx of liquidity and deposits into the system; with QT, you have seen the opposite of that,” said Steven Chubak, an analyst with Wolfe Research. As a result, “the trusts have seen a massive decline in non-interest bearing deposits”.Since December, when the market started to anticipate a pause in rate rises at the Fed, and to reflect investor nerves about QT, the three big trust banks have all underperformed banks in general, and their price-to-book ratios have fallen.The main strategy of the trusts in the face of the pressure on revenue has been to take out costs while offering more services to clients. But, as Mr Harte puts it: “You have to work pretty hard to win the arms race — providing more services for the same dollar.”"
9;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

It makes for a tougher operating environment for banks, which make money by borrowing at low short-term rates and lending at higher longer-term ones.BNY shares ended 9.7 per cent lower on Wednesday at a three-month low of $48.20, and trimming its 2019 gain to 2.6 per cent. The drop was its biggest one-day fall since August 2011, although the stock had been down as much as 10 per cent during intraday trade.
11;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2018-12-14T04:00:32Z;BNY Mellon shelves new London office search ahead of Brexit;US bank will instead seek to extend lease on its current Queen Victoria Street base;BNY Mellon has shelved plans to move to a new headquarters in London and will instead extend the lease on its current office as it opts for a softer commitment in the run-up to Brexit.The US bank had spent the past year drawing up a shortlist of possible new flagship London buildings, including one in Canary Wharf, London’s eastern financial district, as preparation for a potential move in the early 2020s.However it is now in discussions with landlord Blackstone to extend its lease at 160 Queen Victoria Street, its current London base, which expires in 2023, according to two people briefed on the situation.A lease extension would represent a shorter, potentially less expensive commitment than a deal to lease a new headquarters building, which would also incur relocation and fit-out costs.One person briefed on the situation said uncertainty surrounding Brexit had been a factor in BNY Mellon’s shift to a lease extension, although they cautioned that it was not the only reason.BNY Mellon said: “We have been exploring our options and having conversations regarding our office requirements in London for a while, but we are not in a position to confirm any details at this time.”In addition to the City building, BNY Mellon has a 150,000 square foot site in the One Canada Square tower in Canary Wharf, where the lease expires in 2022 after being extended four years ago.The New York-based lender had been seeking a new London base of about 300,000 sq ft.A year ago, research by the Financial Times found that the UK’s biggest international banks were set to move fewer than 4,600 jobs from London in preparation for Brexit, just 6 per cent of their total workforce in the city.BNY Mellon said last year that it expected to create fewer than 20 extra markets-related jobs in continental Europe as a result of Brexit, since it already has a fully licensed bank in Brussels from which it can sell services around the EU.However, the government’s failure to secure parliamentary support for its Brexit deal has increased concerns over the effects of a disruptive no-deal exit.The Bank of England warned in October that “it is not possible for companies on their own to mitigate fully the risks of disruption to cross-border financial services” if there is no “implementation period” following the UK’s departure.Some overseas banks have committed to consolidate staff in new London buildings despite the uncertainties.Deutsche Bank last year committed to take at least 469,000 sq ft in a new City of London development due to be completed in 2021, bringing together staff from several London locations. It will, however, transfer hundreds of billions of assets to Frankfurt, however.Goldman Sachs is building a new 826,000 sq ft headquarters on which it made a sale-and-leaseback deal with Korea’s National Pension Service in August, taking out a 25-year lease.* This article has been amended since original publication to correct the current UK address of BNY Mellon

Specifically Jersey cows, which are famed for their docility, petite size and prodigious output. Mr Harris spent four years in the Channel Islands in the 1980s and 1990s, when he ran Citi’s European investment trust and treasury business. He became a connoisseur of bovines.“I can tell you all about Jersey cows,” he says. “They are some of the best milking cows in the world and they have a beautiful brown coat.”The tranquillity of Jersey is a distant memory. Today, Mr Harris works in Manhattan, which is sadly cow-free, and he heads Bank of New York Mellon’s sprawling $1.9tn asset management arm.BNY Investment Management might not enjoy the recognition given to some of its peers in the $1tn club — BlackRock, Fidelity or Capital Group — but it owns boldfaced names including Insight Investment and Newton in London, Standish and Mellon Capital Management in the US, and credit specialist Alcentra.Sitting in a meeting room enlivened only by an 1869 painting by David Johnson — one of the Hudson River school, which created seminal representations of nature in upstate New York — Mr Harris lays out how he was reshaping BNYIM.“We want to focus on where the market is going rather than being trapped in the past,” he says.January 31 1955$9.4m, includes BNY Mellon stock awardsState University of New York at Albany: BA in political science and history; masters in public administration1979-93

CEO, BNY Mellon Investment ManagementMr Harris came to BNYIM in 2004 when Mellon Financial bought Pareto Partners, the currency-focused asset manager he chaired. Mr Harris moved up the company and won the top job in 2016. His experience makes him appreciate BNYIM’s multi-boutique model — and also what is needed to reshape the organisation to respond to fierce competition.The biggest step came late last year, when BNYIM said it would smash together three of its US investment arms. Although the industry is nowadays abuzz with rumour of mergers and acquisitions, the combination of Mellon Capital, Standish and the Boston Company is a rare example of internal consolidationThe merger reduced the number of asset management entities within BNYIM to 10, from 27 a decade previously. With more than $577bn in assets, the combined business would rank as one of the 10 biggest institutional asset managers in the US and one of the top 50 globally.The move underscores how executives predict the industry will split between smaller, specialist, boutique fund managers, and giants that have the heft to offer investors a one-stop shop and fund the investment in compliance, distribution and technology needed to thrive.While the investment teams will remain untouched, the three asset managers “weren’t of sufficient scale . . . that it made sense to have three CEOs, three CTOs, three compliance teams and legal departments”, says Mr Harris. This will free up resources to reinvest.“Strategically, they were in the traditional equity and fixed income spaces where people are pouring out of, from active to passive,” he says. “Do you revise three businesses or do you consolidate and repivot one business by developing products more attuned to where the business is going?”By the end of this year the “newco” will have a name. “You don’t rebrand Coke until you’ve changed the formula,” Mr Harris quips.The internal merger is the most obvious part of a broader effort to retool BNYIM. It has shuttered, consolidated or reshaped 84 products in two years, while launching 80 lines designed to fit evolving demand. Institutional investors may be shifting into passive products but evaporating bond yields and a dimmer outlook for long-term returns have also spurred them into riskier strategies.“Everyone talks about the active-to-passive shift, and it’s real, but the part they don’t talk about is that it’s a barbell,” says Mr Harris. “They’re moving to emerging markets, to multi-asset products, to distressed debt . . . there are still some good fees to be made in differentiated products.”Technology and data are also in focus. Mr Harris is enthusiastic about how machine learning can trim costs and improve processes. Predictive analytics may also bring more rigour to the fund sales and distribution process. “Sales used to be about golf balls and beer drinking, now there is a science to sales,” he says.The chief executive is also excited about the potential of the parent company’s “mother lode” of data. As well as its $1.9tn of assets under management, BNY Mellon is custodian or administrator of a further $33.3tn, giving it a unique, instantaneous insight into the flow of money in the global financial system.Artificial intelligence will allow its asset management subsidiary to harness that. “To see the world’s movements on a daily basis can tell you an awful lot,” says Mr Harris.1983$1.9tnNew York CityBNY MellonHe cautions, however, that some of the hype over “big data” and AI was overdone.He fetches from his office an Economist article from 1995 that details how Pareto Partners was even then managing an AI-aided $100m bond strategy. So AI is not new and does not always work, Mr Harris says.“Models are good until they’re not. They can’t handle things that are outside the norms,” he points out. “This is like when the internet [was] launched. We knew it was powerful but we had no clue how far it would go. I think people’s excitement far exceeds our ability to harness it.”One area that Mr Harris feels the industry is not overhyping is cyber security. He personally has been the victim of a data breach, an episode that brought home its importance.Institutions such as BNYIM have an edge over smaller rivals in the race to stay a step ahead of hackers, he says, but he still frets over the potential for disaster.Mr Harris compares the cyber security threat to how Earth is constantly pummelled by meteors, with most being vaporised by the atmosphere. “It’s kind of frightening when you think . . . about which one is going to penetrate,” he says.It is a different challenge from his days in Jersey, with its low crime rate. “You didn’t even need to lock your door,” Mr Harris recalls wistfully."
15;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2018-04-12T02:43:18Z;Fed proposes cuts to capital requirements for largest banks;Tweak to controversial leverage ratio will benefit custody banks in particular;The Federal Reserve is proposing to reduce the amount of capital the US’s biggest banks are required to hold by modifying the way a key leverage ratio is calculated.The more relaxed regime would benefit all eight US banks branded as systemically important, but it would do most for the custody banks State Street, BNY Mellon and Northern Trust.On Wednesday the Fed and another bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, announced a plan to revise a metric known as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, which has long been a source of discontent at big banks.The Fed said: “The proposed changes seek to retain a meaningful calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards while not discouraging firms from participating in low-risk activities.”The central bank, which is now led by appointees of Donald Trump, announced the proposal with no fanfare.But Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, which wants tougher regulation of Wall Street, said: “This rule would be easily the most significant rollback of post-crisis risk controls for the largest banks since Trump took office.”The central bank said the changes would reduce the aggregate amount of tier one capital required by the US’s eight systemically important banks by a net $400m, or approximately 0.04 per cent, at the level of their holding companies.But that figure was described as “wildly misleading” by Mr Stanley. He said $400m was the amount of capital the banks could immediately return to their shareholders if the proposal were finalised today.“But this rule could lower capital requirements by many tens or even hundreds of billions in capital if the banks change their balance sheets to load up on assets that regulators assign a low risk weight — such as AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities before the crisis, or Greek debt today,” Mr Stanley said.The change would replace a static leverage ratio with a more “dynamic” metric that takes into account the different risk profiles of banks. The custody banks, which specialise in keeping financial assets safe, tend to engage in mostly low-risk activity.Work on the proposal began under the Fed’s former regulatory chief, Dan Tarullo, an appointee of Barack Obama. He has now been replaced by Trump pick Randal Quarles.Big banks are currently required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of more than 5 per cent — comprising a minimum 3 per cent plus a 2 per cent buffer. For lower-risk institutions the proposal would reduce the buffer to 1 per cent.The Fed did not release estimates of how the proposal would reduce the capital requirements of individual banks.Mr Stanley said: “During the 2008 crisis leverage capital was by far the best protection against bank failure . . . This action is short-sighted and irresponsible and shows that regulators are caving in to the agenda of too big to fail banks.” 
16;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2018-03-28T18:31:34Z;Regulator warns bank reforms threaten financial stability;Tom Hoenig says relaxation of post-crisis constraints could undermine US economy;A top US bank regulator has fired a parting shot at lawmakers by warning that a bank-deregulation bill that has passed the Senate could pose a threat to financial stability.Tom Hoenig, who is due to step down as vice-chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in coming weeks, said in a speech on Wednesday that relaxing constraints put in place since the financial crisis could “undermine the long-term resilience of not only the banking system, but the broader economy as well.” *In particular, he took aim at efforts to loosen capital rules for custody banks, which play a vital role in financial markets by keeping tens of trillions of dollars of financial assets safe and accounted for. Under a bill that passed the Senate this month and is now in the House of Representatives, custody-focused banks would be allowed to deduct cash held on behalf of clients from the calculation of a key metric known as the supplementary leverage ratio, which measures capital as a percentage of gross assets.Doing so would lower the amount of capital the banks need to meet the requirements of the SLR, allowing them to return more cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.Top executives at the three biggest custody banks — BNY Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust — have consistently argued that the rule unfairly penalises banks which absorbed a lot of client cash during the Lehman crisis as big asset-manager clients liquidated their holdings.Memories are short and, with an improving economy, these laws and regulations . . . are eventually recast as burdensome constraints. And here we are again.But Mr Hoenig told an audience in Washington: “These trusted custodians must remain pillars of strength and should be retaining capital, not reducing it.”He added: “How unfortunate that during the last crisis these custody banks were seriously undercapitalised and as confidence in them ebbed, the government found itself supporting them under emergency conditions at levels reaching $60bn to $90bn a day.”The banking bill moved smoothly through the Senate with the backing of a handful of moderate Democrats, but it has since been held up in the House of Representatives, where conservative lawmakers want to impose more radical reforms.Liberal Democrats led by Senator Elizabeth Warren have voiced criticisms of the bill that echo Mr Hoenig’s concerns.The three most powerful US bank regulators — the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC — imposed a 3 per cent SLR in 2013 as part of the Basel III capital accords, applying it to all banks with more than $250bn in total consolidated assets.For the eight banks deemed to be “global systemically important”, including BNY and State Street, the US regulators went a step further, requiring them to meet a 5 per cent SLR at the holding company level and a 6 per cent SLR at the bank level.Mr Hoenig is expected to stand down from the FDIC in April after six years, capping a 44-year career in bank supervision, largely at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.During his speech he noted that one common element of financial crises is the aftermath, in which new rules are enacted with the aim of preventing a recurrence.“But memories are short and with an improving economy, these laws and regulations — which early in the recovery are viewed as essential — are eventually recast as burdensome constraints that need to be eased or ended,” he said. “And here we are again.”
17;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2018-03-09T00:11:19Z;BNY Mellon’s Scharf plays it pragmatic at debut investor day;New chief executive says tough backdrop is unlikely to change at US’s oldest bank;Expectations were high for Charlie Scharf’s debut investor day at BNY Mellon. The former JPMorgan Chase banker, an acolyte of Jamie Dimon, had been hired as chief executive last summer from Visa, the San Francisco-based payments group, with a mandate to inject new life in to the oldest bank in America.Mr Scharf began the triennial event brightly, saying how much he admired BNY’s main business lines of investment services and investment management, while stressing there were no “silver bullets” to transform the company’s outlook.But as the morning wore on, senior executives painted a gloomier picture, with Mike Santomassimo, chief financial officer, disclosing for the first time that organic revenue growth over the past few years, excluding fee waivers and other external factors, had been about 0.5 per cent. By 2019, BNY said, total top-line growth should be “slightly” better than last year’s 4 per cent, assuming a gently rising stock market and continued normalisation of interest rates. That was on the low end of estimates from Wall Street analysts such as Susan Roth Katzke of Credit Suisse, who had outlined a range of 4 to 6 per cent in a preview note.It was reasonable for [Charlie Scharf] to take a balanced and hopefully conservative stance in his first investor dayOne analyst in the room, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that by the end the mood was somewhat deflated. “Where’s the drama? This is Jamie Dimon’s right-hand guy and you’re coming in to say revenue sucked in the past and will be only ‘slightly’ better in the future?”The shares closed down 2.1 per cent, having dipped as much as 4 per cent during the day. The rest of the big US banks moved fractionally higher, with the broader market.Generating a sense of excitement around BNY, founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, will not be easy. The bank essentially serves as a giant back office for the world’s capital markets, providing custody, clearing and other functions to help keep financial assets safe and accounted for. The core investment services division, looking after $33.3tn of assets in total, made up about three-quarters of the bank’s $15.5bn in revenues last year.That is low-octane and mostly low-margin stuff. High barriers to entry because of tight regulation and expensive technology, combined with fierce pressure on margins, makes the custody business “the world’s worst oligopoly”, in the words of Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo. He noted that overall revenue growth across the industry has fallen steadily over the past 30 years, slipping from a compound annual rate of about 12 per cent to 4 per cent in the decade-to-date.Mr Scharf, striking a contrast from past chief executives by appearing tieless in a button-down shirt, said on Thursday that the backdrop is unlikely to change. Pricing pressures are “not a new phenomenon”, he said, noting that the typical contract with an asset manager runs from five to seven years. “And as you’ll hear throughout the day, nothing leads us to believe that anything is different there.”But he stressed that BNY could drive revenue growth through its investment management business, the seventh-biggest in the world by assets under management, and particularly through its wealth arm, focused on the US.And after years of intensive cost cuts there was still some “juice” left, Mr Scharf said, citing a probable flattening of compliance expenses and a consolidation of office space. “Getting to efficiency, getting to the core of the expense base, it is like an onion. You just peel it back and you see things that you didn’t see,” he said.Regulatory changes could be a tailwind too, added Mr Santomassimo, if a more “open-minded” cast of characters at the Federal Reserve begins to loosen requirements on capital and liquidity.But given the tough outlook in the core business, analysts said that it probably made sense for the new chief executive to set the bar low.“It was reasonable for him to take a balanced and hopefully conservative stance in his first investor day,” said Ken Usdin, analyst at Jefferies.“There’s a lot to get your arms around with this company and a lot of complex business lines which all need to move together. He did a good job of demonstrating where the building blocks can improve from here.”

19;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2018-02-05T03:30:34Z;State Street chief takes aim at the cost of servicing;Bank’s chief executive-to-be says activities will move to front office;"Not long before Ron O’Hanley was named the next chief executive of State Street, the world’s second-biggest trust bank, a New York analyst set out his challenge in blunt terms. The business of keeping financial assets safe and accounted for, he said, is “the world’s worst oligopoly”.There are a handful of big players, high barriers to entry due to tight regulation and expensive technology — and unrelenting pressure on margins. Every cent an investor spends on the humdrum business of custody and record-keeping is a cent that doesn’t accrue, ultimately, to a nurse or a firefighter with a pension fund.The pressure to do everything for less results in “terrible, sometimes value-destroying pricing,” said the analyst, Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mr O’Hanley doesn’t see it that way. Appointed as president and chief operating officer in November, he is due to step up to be chief executive of the 226-year-old bank, the second oldest in the US, by the end of the year. He accepts that the core business of servicing assets can be tough, but says that is where the creativity is.He cites a recent example in which State Street worked with a quantitative hedge fund to develop a dynamic trading plan, so the fund could adapt the day’s scheduled orders according to the flow of news. In another case, the company helped a big public pension fund to shift from a defined-benefit to a defined-contribution scheme, “unitising” its pool of assets.In other words, the company is moving beyond the humdrum business of custody. Or as Mr O’Hanley puts it, from the middle office to the front office.He’s been in charge of 20% of the business; now it’s the rest he has to worry about“That’s what the industry needs to be able to do,” he says, during an interview in his office overlooking the trading floor at State Street’s art deco headquarters in Boston. A day later the bank reported fourth-quarter results showing a 7 per cent spike in servicing fees from a year earlier, on $33tn of assets.“It’s no longer enough to just say that we’re a great custodian or a great accountant,” he says, noting that servicing accounts for about four-fifths of State Street’s revenues, which came to $11.2bn last year. “Now it really is around information and information management and data; how do I make it available and useful to [clients] in their investment process.”Other big trust banks are in the grip of management changes. At Bank of New York Mellon, the biggest with $15.5bn in revenues, new chief executive Charlie Scharf, 52, is trying to fuse skills he learnt while running JPMorgan Chase’s retail bank with technology insights he picked up during a four-year spell on the west coast with Visa. At Northern Trust in Chicago, Michael O’Grady, 52, the former finance chief and head of the asset-servicing unit, has recently replaced Frederick “Rick” Waddell, 64.Mr O’Hanley — who joined State Street in 2015 following stints at Fidelity Investments, BNY Mellon and McKinsey — was previously chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, the bank’s investment arm which is the world’s third-biggest fund manager by assets.The key question is how much performance is alpha, or factor-based — and whether the client can get a similar result more cheaplyIt will be up to the 60-year-old asset-management veteran to show that he can get a grip on servicing, says Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. According to Wells Fargo figures, combined assets under custody at the top three independent trust banks, plus JPMorgan, rose from about $23tn in 2001 to $82tn last year but fees as a percentage of those assets dropped from 3.5 basis points to 2.3bps over that period, on a trailing 12-month basis.“He’s been in charge of 20 per cent of the business; now it’s the rest he has to worry about,” says Mr Kleinhanzl.By his side will be Cyrus Taraporevala, the new president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. He will have challenges of his own. The exchange-traded fund business, for example, lost ground last year to BlackRock and Vanguard. That’s tough to take for a company that launched the first US-listed ETF in 1993.Year founded: 1792Assets: $2.8 trillion, Dec 31 2017Employees: 37,000Headquarters: BostonOwnership: Publicly listedTicker: STTBetsy Graseck, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says Mr O’Hanley showed he was “a long-term thinker” during his spell at SSGA, pushing it into higher-margin products. Active strategies now account for less than 8 per cent of SSGA’s $2.8tn in AUM.The key question, says Mr Taraporevala, is how much performance is alpha, or factor-based — and whether the client can get a similar result more cheaply. “How much can we deliver in an index, what can we deliver in a factor-based way, what are the true active pieces that the client couldn’t get in a more cost-effective way?” he asks.Putting all that together “is the new active,” Mr Taraporevala says.Both men say they are generally pleased at the direction of financial-regulatory reform under the Donald Trump administration. As Mr Taraporevala says, there’s a recognition that the “pendulum” had swung too far after the financial crisis, penalising banks with overzealous rules.We’re actually helping investors get their job done at a lower costMr O’Hanley expects relief for the specialist custody banks on a metric known as the supplementary leverage ratio, for example, which calculates capital as a percentage of total assets. That was not a constraint during the crisis, he notes, when State Street’s balance sheet was swollen with cash as big asset-manager clients liquidated their holdings.“You really don’t want us in a time of crisis trying to push that stuff off,” he says. “It was very beneficial to regulators to kind of know where that cash was; it was a daily barometer on investment sentiment.”Meanwhile Mr O’Hanley will keep pushing on a decade-long technology upgrade. Wave one involved moving a fifth of applications to the cloud; wave two (2015-20) is about meeting client needs in real time.If all goes to plan, State Street’s return on equity could be an industry-leading 15 per cent by 2020, says Mr Mayo, from 10.6 per cent last year.“We’re actually helping investors get their job done at a lower cost and therefore to higher benefits to themselves,” says Mr O’Hanley. “There’s not any place I’d rather be.”Age 60Total pay $9mEducation Syracuse university; MBA, Harvard Business SchoolCareer

20;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2018-01-18T22:00:00Z;American Express suspends buybacks after tax hit;Credit card issuer posts quarterly loss;American Express on Thursday said it plans to suspend its share buyback programme as a result of the tax reform that resulted in a $2.6bn charge and pushed it to a quarterly loss.“The upfront charge triggered by the Tax Act reduced our capital ratios and, as a result, while we will be continuing our quarterly dividends at the current level, we plan to suspend our share buyback program for the first half of 2018 in order to rebuild our capital,” outgoing chief executive Kenneth Chenault, said.The decision comes after regulators last summer gave American Express a yellow card over its plans to hand cash back to shareholders. The company was forced to rewrite its capital distribution plan after the first round of the Federal Reserve’s stress tests, although regulators gave their blessing to a more conservative payout proposal.The New York-based company also said it swung to a net loss of $1.2bn or $1.41 a share in the three months ended in December, compared with a profit of $825m or 88 cents a share in the year ago period.American Express had previously warned that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act pushed through by Republicans in December would reduce its earnings and on Thursday estimated a $2.6bn tax-related charge, including taxes on deemed repatriations of overseas earnings, up from $2.4bn previously.Stripping out the impact of the tax overhaul, the company reported quarterly earnings of $1.58 a share, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.54 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts.The loss accompanied a 10 per cent increase in consolidated revenues to $8.8bn, which also topped expectations. The increase reflected higher card member spending, loans and fees. Consolidated expenses fell 1 per cent to $6.2bn, reflecting lower spending on marketing and lower technology costs and consulting fees.The earnings season has already been muddied because of the biggest change to the US tax system since 1986, which among other things includes a cut in the domestic corporate rate to 21 per cent from 35 per cent and lowers the tax rate for repatriated assets. Several other companies have taken accounting hits. Citi, for instance, took a $22bn writedown. Most groups, however, have signalled they can easily absorb the charges.American Express shares are up 0.7 per cent so far this year following a 34 per cent rally last year. Shares were down more than 2 per cent in extended trade.Also on Thursday, shares in Bank of New York Mellon dropped 4.4 per cent after it pledged to spend much of an expected tax windfall on staff and investments in the business instead of returning the cash to shareholders.Taken together, the developments are a sign of pressures on boardrooms arising from the tax reforms — including how to handle the immediate accounting fallout and tensions over how to divvy up the long-term spoils.Mr Chenault said he expects the tax changes to be a “positive development” for both the US and the company. American Express now expects to invest an additional $200m in customer-facing initiatives this year than previously thought. The company has also made a contribution to its employee profit-sharing plans and expects to use the remaining benefits “to build capital and support earnings growth”.The company now expects to earn between $6.90 to $7.30 a share in 2018.
21;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BNY Mellon shares fall on plan to use tax savings on wages, investments;;Shares in Bank of New York Mellon dropped about 5 per cent on Thursday after it pledged to spend much of its tax windfall on staff and investments in the business, a sign of emerging tensions at big US companies over how to divvy up the spoils of the new law.Charles Scharf, appointed chief executive last summer, said he expected to reinvest the “vast majority” of gains this year from Washington’s sweeping tax reforms in “our employees and our businesses”.“We’ve got a responsibility to our employees to share the benefit, as well as to invest as much as we intelligently can to build the company for the future”.The bank would “meaningfully increase” spending on technology and also raise the minimum wage for lower-paid US employees to $15 an hour. It estimated its effective tax rate would drop from 25 per cent to about 21 per cent this year.BNY’s plans stand in contrast to those of other banks, which have told investors they will reap much of the rewards. Bank of America was among the most explicit, telling shareholders this week they were in line for “the largest portion” of the gains through higher dividends and share buybacks.In a note on Thursday, Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI, said that while he understands BNY’s “need to invest for growth, investors will be bummed in the short term”. Hopes over a tax boost pushed the group’s shares up as much as 15 per cent since the middle of the November.Mr Scharf has made clear his desire to lead a technological shake-up at 230-year-old BNY, which maintains records, tracks performance and lends securities for institutional investors. He formerly led a digital push at Visa.BNY had come under pressure from activist investors who encouraged it to do more to deal with the profit-damping impact of low interest rates.

22;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2018-01-16T20:06:47Z;Charts that matter: Pound rising towards major level;;If there is a tipping point for cable — the nickname for the pound’s value against the dollar — it is the $1.40 level. Historically, the market tends to see $1.40 as a floor for the currency, and in the post-Brexit era, that floor is coming into view.Cable breached $1.38 on Monday for the first time since the EU referendum, taking its rise in the past three trading days to 2 per cent. Since early November, cable has risen 5.5 per cent.The pound is enjoying some respite from traders selling the dollar across the board, although some evidence that a softer Brexit appears likely has also helped. The pound’s climb from $1.35 to above $1.38 since the start of January has also been accompanied by the two-year gilt yield rising towards 0.60 per cent, a level not seen since early 2016.Brexit developments will also have a strong say on the pound’s ability to get to $1.40 and beyond, but there are three periods in recent history when sterling has had a spurt on the back of a recovery around this level. During the era of free-floating currencies after the collapse of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s, sterling has rarely strayed below $1.40 and, until Brexit, bounced back.Crédit Agricole has a long-term fair value for cable at $1.40, which is its year-end forecast, though forex strategist Valentin Marinov says Brexit uncertainty, the weak UK economic outlook and a likely cautious Bank of England will make it hard to get there.The focus for cable will really be on the US side, according to Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon. Although the pound has climbed against the dollar, it has moved very little against the euro. That suggests cable’s move is “all about the dollar”.Read more FT markets charts that matter to investors here.
23;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Euro testing three-year highs in buoyant start to 2018;;"Happy new euro!The opening trading hours of 2018 are proving to be very rosy for the euro, which is tickling a three-year high at $1.2079. Just a few fractions of a percentage point more will mark the highest level since January 2015.Broad weakness in the dollar is of course helping here; the dollar index is down by 0.37 per cent so far today. But the euro’s rise is outstripping that of sterling, which is up by 0.34 per cent. (The euro is 0.55 per cent higher.) Sparkling data on the health of the region’s manufacturers certainly appear to be adding fuel to the move.Neil Mellor at BNY Mellon points out that this taste of dollar weakness, if it sticks, could become problematic for central banks around the world:At a potentially pivotal point in many economic cycles across the G20, marked currency appreciation has the potential to eviscerate forecasts for reviving inflation, which points to the possibility of any tentative plans for policy changes being placed on ice."
24;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-12-19T23:38:08Z;US banks pass new post-crisis milestone;Regulators approve living wills designed to avert future bailouts;The biggest US banks got another boost from Washington on Tuesday when watchdogs gave them passing grades on a test designed to prevent the kind of meltdown triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers.The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found that “living wills” drawn up by eight of the country’s largest and most complex banks, which show how they could be wound up in a crisis without taxpayer support, were satisfactory.While the regulators found the plans from Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had some “shortcomings”, the problems were not as serious as those identified in previous years.The findings, which the Fed said reflected “significant progress”, cap a year of regulatory wins for the industry that have helped push shares in S&P 500 banks up by a fifth in 2017 to record highs. Higher interest rates and tax cuts that are on the brink of becoming law this week have also fuelled the rally.The living will regime, a central pillar of the Dodd-Frank reforms introduced after the Lehman crisis, is aimed at improving the safety and soundness of the financial system and avoiding the need for government bailouts. Regulators have powers to force banks to shed chunks of their business if they persistently fail to meet the required standard.Last year, only Citigroup received an entirely passing grade. Then, the two regulators ruled that five banks’ living wills had “deficiencies”, meaning they were “not credible, or would not facilitate an orderly resolution”.One of those five, Wells Fargo, failed to fix the problems, prompting watchdogs to place restrictions on its business, although these have since been lifted.This year, none of the plans had “deficiencies”. Four banks — Citi, JPMorgan Chase, State Street and Bank of New York Mellon — got the all clear. The others have been told that their subsequent submissions require “additional work”.The Fed has signalled it is open to letting banks submit their resolution plans every two years, instead of annually.
25;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-12-05T05:15:25Z;Investors fail to back votes on greater climate change disclosure;Vanguard, BlackRock and BNY Mellon have weak record holding US utilities to account;The world’s largest asset managers have failed to back motions seeking greater climate change disclosure at America’s biggest utility groups, putting a question mark over the depth of their commitment to combating the issue.Vanguard, BlackRock, BNYMellon and Invesco all voted against resolutions aimed at forcing the companies to report on how efforts to keep a global temperature rise this century to below 2 degrees Celsius will affect them, according to Preventable Surprises, a campaign group.The 2 degree limit, above pre-industrial levels, was the benchmark agreed by global leaders in Paris in 2015.Nine of the 10 big investors examined by Preventable Surprises are signatories to the UN’s responsible investment initiative, the Principles for Responsible Investment, which includes a pledge that they will “seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest”.However an analysis of shareholder votes at this year’s annual meetings showed they have a mixed scorecard when it comes to holding US utilities to account.Nine of the ten biggest groups — including FirstEnergy, Dominion Energy and Southern — had resolutions for greater climate change disclosure in the spring of 2017, eight of which failed to pass.Vanguard, BlackRock and BNY Mellon voted against all nine resolutions.“Some investment firms’ proxy voting lacks the sense of urgency required for transitioning to a 2°C economy,” the report said. “Public support of shareholder resolutions at laggard companies is critical because behind-closed-doors engagement lacks transparency, accountability and meaningful metrics.”Northern Trust was the only investor to consistently support increased disclosure on climate risk according to Preventable Surprises.Utility groups accounted for 63 per cent of CO2 emissions reported to the US’s Environmental Protection Agency last year, compared to 15 per cent from the oil and gas sector.There is increasing pressure on energy companies to spell out their financial exposure to climate change.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that investors face “potentially huge” losses due to tougher rules to curb climate change and a task force by the G20’s Financial Stability Board has recommended that listed companies disclose their exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities.Yet the voting record of big investors for utilities this year stands in contrast to that for energy groups.Rob Main, head of company engagement and voting for Vanguard, said the $4.7tn asset manager’s preferred approach was to press for change in face-to-face meetings with company executives. “It is important for us to see how companies are assessing this kind of risk,” he said. “We do believe we can have significant impact through engagement.”BlackRock also stressed its belief that engagement with companies can lead to positive changes.BNY Mellon Investment Management said each of its investment boutiques made “investment and proxy voting decisions that are in the best economic interest of the client, consistent with each particular client’s investment guidelines, rather than BNY Mellon’s,” but added that the group was “an advocate for climate change action”.Invesco declined to comment.BlackRock and Vanguard were among those earlier his year which stepped up pressure on US energy companies to address the risks associated with climate change. In votes at seven of the largest US energy companies, the 30 largest investors switched their votes to support disclosure on climate risk, having opposed similar resolutions a year earlier, according to a recent study.
26;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-11-29T16:57:11Z;Fund houses probed by FCA for IPO price collusion;Artemis, Hargreave Hale, Newton and River & Mercantile investigated by UK watchdog;"Four asset managers have allegedly broken competition law by colluding on prices for flotations and a share placement, as the financial watchdog revealed the identities of companies that risk swingeing fines under its first price-fixing investigation.Artemis Investment Management, Hargreave Hale, BNY Mellon’s Newton Investment Management and River & Mercantile Asset Management were named on Wednesday in the Financial Conduct Authority’s first so-called statement of objections, a formal step in antitrust probes that lays out initial findings of alleged rule breaches.The companies ultimately risk fines of as much as 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover in a particular market if the FCA proves its case, which it opened in 2015. A number of individuals also face investigation under the FCA’s financial-regulatory rather than competition powers, people familiar with the case said.The case turns on small-cap companies’ IPOs in 2014 and 2015. By allegedly colluding rather than competing on price, the asset managers may have pushed down the value at which the companies were listed.The FCA alleged that Newton, Hargreave Hale and River & Mercantile disclosed or accepted information on prices relating to one IPO and a placing, while Artemis and Newton shared information on prices they were willing to pay in relation to another offering.“The sharing generally occurred on a bilateral basis and allowed firms to know the other’s plans during the IPO or placing process when they should have been competing for shares,” the regulator said in the statement of objections.The companies now have an opportunity to try to rebut the objections in front of a special regulatory committee before the FCA publishes its final decision.Artemis and River & Mercantile said they were co-operating with the investigation.“The FCA’s investigation is focused on a very small number of Newton’s UK equity-focused strategies which can invest in small and mid-cap UK equities. Specifically, it relates to activity surrounding two initial public offerings and a placement in 2014 and 2015,” said a Newton spokeswoman, who added the asset manager was co-operating with the FCA. “There has to date been no loss to any clients/investors as a result of the activity and we do not anticipate any loss in the future.”Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, which acquired Hargreave Hale in September, said: “This matter . . . was disclosed to us during our due diligence process. Hargreave Hale has fully co-operated with the FCA and will be making further representations to the FCA for its review.”The FCA inherited competition powers in 2015 and is one of the only financial regulators in the world to have both financial regulatory and antitrust powers; a particularly potent combination. It has not wasted time using its powers and has launched a series of sweeping market studies.One of these was into the asset-management sector, which led to proposals for a radical shake-up of the £7tn sector. As a result of the study it also referred investment consultants, a key part of the asset-management industry, for a full-blown probe by the Competition & Markets Authority. This can recommend a break-up of companies even if no technical breach of competition law has occurred.The FCA began investigating alleged collusion on IPOs two years ago, according to people familiar with the situation. In the interim, it also launched a separate competition probe into aviation brokers including Aon and Jardine Lloyd Thompson, which became public earlier this year. European antitrust authorities have since taken over the investigation."

But with investments in technology and research rising across the industry, insiders and analysts say bulking up is increasingly vital to share the costs, and expect more consolidation as a result.There have been a smattering of big combinations recently, such as Standard Life merging with Aberdeen and Henderson with Janus. But BNY Mellon’s decision to merge its three biggest US money management arms – Mellon Capital Management, Standish Mellon Asset Management and The Boston Company Asset Management — is an unusual example of internal consolidation in one of the world’s biggest investment groups.Mitchell Harris, CEO of BNY Mellon Investment Management, said in a statement:Clients are increasingly looking for specialist managers with differentiated investment strategies and competitive pricing. This requires scale in risk management, technology and operations to deliver upon these needs…. Today’s investment environment is evolving rapidly, and BNY Mellon’s multi-boutique model is well positioned to offer specialist active and passive solutions from our bench of leading investment managers.Mellon Capital Management, often shortened to MCM, is a largely passive investment arm. Standish is a big bond house, while TBCAM is an active equity fund manager.With over $560bn in assets under management, the combined business will rank as a top-10 institutional asset manager in the US and a top 50 manager globally, BNYM said.

The Fed is expected to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at 1-1.25 per cent while signalling the start of a multiyear process of paring back its $4.5tn balance sheet.Then, next month, the European Central Bank takes its turn to signal its intentions for the first steps on its road to tighter monetary policy.As Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon puts it:This week could see the Federal Reserve announce that it plans to start reducing its balance sheet at some point in the near future while the October meeting of the European Central Bank could see it announce a further reduction in its monthly asset purchases.

31;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-09-05T15:55:18Z;Treasuries jump, banks fall as geopolitical risks weigh on markets;;Financials were trailing the broader market on Tuesday morning, with bank stocks slumping in early trading as Treasuries rallied amid renewed concerns about North Korea.Goldman Sachs shares dropped nearly 3 per cent, while Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America all declined more than 2 per cent apiece in early trading. Bank of New York Mellon, PNC and Wells Fargo each were down more than 1 per cent as well.The declines come as investors digest geopolitical events over the long weekend, when North Korea ratcheted up tensions even further with reports that it has conducted its largest nuclear test to date.That has contributed to a decreased appetite for riskier assets after trading resumed on Tuesday, which was compounded by comments from a Federal Reserve senior policymaker, Lael Brainard, who said that weakness of price growth over the past five years was “troubling” and suggested the US central bank should be cautious about lifting rates again until inflation was firmly back on track.Even as Wall Street shunned banks, they piled into US Treasuries, pushing yields on the 10-year benchmark note down to 2.08 per cent, its lowest point since just after US President Donald Trump’s election in November, according to Factset data. Yields move in the opposite direction of prices.
32;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-08-31T04:02:04Z;Six global banks join forces to create digital currency;‘Utility settlement coin’ aims to launch next year for blockchain settlements;Six of the world’s biggest banks have joined a project to create a new form of digital cash that they hope to launch next year for clearing and settling financial transactions over blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin.Barclays, Credit Suisse, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC, MUFG and State Street have teamed up to work on the “ utility settlement coin” which was created by Switzerland’s UBS to make financial markets more efficient.The move comes as the project shifts into a new phase of development, in which its members aim to deepen discussions with central banks and to work on tightening up its data privacy and cyber security protections.Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investment and fintech innovation at UBS, said: “We have been in discussions with central banks and regulators and we will continue that over the next 12 months with the aim of a limited ‘go live’ at the back end of 2018.”Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms that allows so-called cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — to be traded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger.Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets.“The distributed ledger is one of the most innovative technologies out there,” said Lee Braine from the chief technology office of Barclays’ investment bank. “From reducing risk to improving capital efficiency in financial markets we see several benefits of this project.”The utility settlement coin, based on a product developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial groups pay each other or to buy securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed.Instead they would use digital coins that are directly convertible into cash at central banks, cutting the time, cost and capital required in post-trade settlement and clearing.The coins, each convertible into different currencies, would be stored using blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, allowing them to be swapped quickly for the financial securities being traded. Existing members of the project are Deutsche Bank, Banco Santander, BNY Mellon and NEX.Mr Jaffrey said: “This isn’t going to come in with a big bang, it is going to come in with a series of developments over time.”He said that in the first instance, from the end of next year, he expected the utility settlement coin to be used for banks to pay each other in different currencies. For instance, if one bank owed $100m to a rival with a £50m debt in the other direction, the two institutions could transfer the money almost instantly using the new coins.Before the coins could be used for settling securities trades, he said the securities themselves will need to be transferred to blockchain systems, otherwise the benefits of speed and reduced capital requirements will be lost.Peter Randall, founder of the UK-based rival Setl, said there were still questions over whether payments using a quasi- central bank currency would be considered certain and risk-free enough to achieve “settlement finality” — reducing the capital and liquid assets that need to be held against them.But Mr Jaffrey said that “following legal, regulatory and accounting viewpoints, we now feel we have a structure that gives us a basis to move on to phase three with a workable structure” for achieving “settlement finality”.He admitted the utility settlement coin could be rendered obsolete if enough central banks issued their own blockchain-based digital currencies, yet he added that was likely to take “many years”, especially given the “public policy questions” involved.
33;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-08-18T08:18:24Z;Euro picks up after knock from ECB;;The euro has shaken off the dent it suffered on signs that the European Central Bank is uneasy about the risk of an overshoot.The currency dipped on Thursday after minutes of the central bank’s latest policy-setting meeting showed concern that pulling back from stimulus measures could fuel an uncomfortable rally.“Concerns were expressed about a possible overshooting in the repricing by … markets, notably the foreign exchange markets, in the future,” the minutes said. (More on that here.)But on Friday, the currency was steady on the day against the dollar, at $1.1728, up from its $1.1660 low struck on Thursday.Naturally, analysts have been chewing over the implications of the ECB’s stance.HSBC’s Daragh Maher thinks the currency is looking “vulnerable”:The rally this year has been impressive but August has seen some of the upward momentum fade. Positive news is generating less of an impact and the latest batch of ECB minutes show a growing disquiet with euro strength. Such sentiments could be repeated by ECB President Draghi in upcoming speeches, including at the high profile Jackson Hole symposium. As a result, we are exiting our long position in [the euro against sterling] at £0.9110 for a total return of 2.50%.Rabobank writes:There had been a discussion about the exchange rate, [with] concerns mainly focused on future risks of overshooting. At the same time, the Council noted that the sovereign and corporate markets have been fairly resilient to the repricing of the risk-free curve. In that sense, the Council members did not seem overly concerned about immediate risks and we continue to believe that current financial conditions will allow them to proceed with a ‘tapering’ announcement in autumn.Crucially, we believe that the mention of ‘risks of overshooting in the future’ lends support to our view that the Governing Council will use its other instruments to contain the risks of an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions as a side-effect of such a ‘tapering’ plan. More specifically, we believe that the ECB will have to further decouple the interest rate policy from its asset purchases.We believe… the ECB may need to keep interest rates at very low levels for a substantial period after the asset purchases have stopped.Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon says the market is “not quite listening” to the ECB, and it’s worth watching closely:While it seems unlikely that Draghi will use his speech at Jackson Hole to address policy issues it is also clear that the most effective way the central bank can tackle unwanted euro strength will be to start downplaying the likelihood of any reduction in the asset purchase programme.Given that ECB policy decisions have been behind a number of the more volatile sessions seen over the past three years it would therefore seem to make sense to listen particularly closely for any rhetoric on this theme over the next few weeks.
34;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-08-11T07:26:08Z;Wobbly open for European stocks but analysts ask: ‘why so muted?’;;To reiterate, this is not run-to-the-hills mode. But markets are showing their nerves.In early trading:As we noted earlier, Bunds are also on the up, though gold, the Swiss franc and yen – big barometers of stress – are not really moving.Rabobank asks: “Why so muted?The VIX index is now at its highest level since April 2017 but this level is still very low in the context of developments since the financial crisis. 10yr Treasury and Bund yields have moved lower but these moves are still small even in the context of 2017. The S&P index has undergone a decline, but this has been small in the context of the stellar gains of 2017.Even the decline in the South Korean exchange looks relatively small given how exposed the country obviously is to developments in North Korea.We would suggest that the small size of the moves (on a historic basis) is reflective of the extreme difficulty the market faces in pricing in the ramifications of a nuclear confrontation.On that note, Lutz Karpowitz at Commerzbank says:The role of the yen as a safe haven made no sense during the debt crisis in Europe (as Japanese debt is much higher), but now Japan is at the epicentre of a possible catastrophe. If we were to see a military conflict it is difficult to imagine how Japan would not be directly involved. No matter which expert reporting on the status of North Korean rockets one wants to believe: there is no safe haven in Japan in case of a conflict with North Korea – only in the minds of the global FX traders. And they will continue to [buy the yen] while tensions continue.Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon also writes:It is noticeable that the current relative insensitivity to geopolitical risk is not an isolated phenomenon but, rather, has been a common feature of markets over the past fourteen years. The annexation of Crimea, for example, in the first quarter of 2014 had only the most passing impact on anything but regional markets. This indifference stood in marked contrast to the high sensitivity seen to more direct financial market risks such as the Eurozone crisis or fears of currency devaluation by China.It is also apparent that attitudes to specific kinds of risk can change rapidly. While electoral or referendum risks didn’t particularly resonate with investors pre-2016 (bar a brief flurry of concerns around the vote on Scottish independence) this changed following the UK plebiscite on EU membership and the US presidential election. With the perceived collective wisdom within markets about the likely outcome of both events proving to be flawed, each significant referendum (Italy at the end of the year) or election (the Netherlands, France, the UK) since then has received a great deal of attention.The most compelling argument as to why markets have become so indifferent to geopolitics is that, broadly speaking, this has proved to be a winning strategy since 2003.Memories of the market impact of the Gulf War between August 1990 and February 1991 meant that when the invasion of Iraq began in March of 2003 investors spent a good deal of time considering possible outcomes. However, to a large degree, this proved a waste of time with the VIX falling steadily from the moment of the invasion onwards while US equity indices entered a bull market that would effectively last until the summer of 2007. In the event the only thing that appeared to matter was the fact that the FOMC was continuing to ease monetary policy.Given the extraordinary levels of monetary policy easing by all major central banks seen since them and that no geopolitical event has led to an outcome that was perceived as being a direct threat to mainstream markets, it makes sense that investors collectively have learnt to ignore these risks. However, as last year proved, it takes just one or two events occurring that show the perceived wisdom to be wrong for a profound shift in investor behaviour to emerge.
35;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-07-17T17:19:17Z;BNY Mellon taps former Visa chief to head bank;Charles Scharf led credit card group through digital push;BNY Mellon has appointed the banker who led a digital push at Visa to put the 230-year-old institution that has come under pressure from activist investors through a technology-driven shake-up.Newly appointed chief executive, Charles Scharf, who is also a Microsoft director, said he would bring a “fresh set of eyes every day” to BNY, where he is replacing Gerald Hassell, a 44 year company veteran.Mr Scharf — a JPMorgan Chase veteran who left Visa in December because family reasons made it “difficult” for him to spend enough time in California where the payments company is based — is joining BNY, which is based in Manhattan, with immediate effect. BNY, which maintains records, tracks performance and lends securities for institutional investors, had been encouraged by activist investors to do more to deal with the profit-dampening impact of persistently low interest rates.However, Mr Hassell said on Monday that there had been “no undue influence” from the activists. Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners won a board seat in 2014 and, according to S&P Capital IQ data, is BNY’s eighth biggest shareholder.“Technology is changing almost any industry across the world today — anyone who doesn’t think so hasn’t caught up with reality,” Mr Scharf said. “It’s certainly true for this company.”“There’s even more opportunity to use technology in different ways — for incumbents and newcomers,” he addedThe rapid change of leadership and the bank’s decision to choose an external candidate surprised some Wall Street analysts. Gerard Cassidy, at RBC Capital Markets, said he thought that chief financial officer Todd Gibbons or a head of one of the bank’s business lines “could have replaced Mr Hassell”.However, Mr Hassell, who turns 66 in October and has been chief executive since 2011, said: “It all sort of came together in the right way at the right time. There was no timeline pressure associated with it.”He added: “We have some truly outstanding people internally who are going to complement Charlie, and Charlie is going to complement them.”Before his four years at the helm of Visa, Mr Scharf was head of JPMorgan Chase’s retail financial services and served as managing director of One Equity Partners, the bank’s private investment arm.Asked about the possibility of acquisitions and disposals, Mr Scharf said he was not arriving at BNY with “any preconceived notion that something [a part of the business] needs to go, or that we need to do something else”. He added, however, that BNY should “continue to not rest on the past”.Analysts at KBW said that while the appointment was a positive, it was challenging to see “where Mr Scharf can accelerate growth relative to the growth prospects that were available to Gerald Hassell”.Last month, the bank brought in a new chief information officer, Bridget Engle, from Bank of America.Mr Hassell is staying on at BNY as chairman until the end of the year, after which Mr Scharf will hold both senior positions. Korn Ferry, the executive search firm, led the hunt for his successor.BNY shares were up 2 per cent in lunchtime trading in New York.

He will be replacing 65-year old Gerald Hassell, who is retiring but will continue to serve as chairman of the board until the end of the year. After that, Mr Scharf will also assume the role of board chairman.“Today’s announcement is the culmination of the Board of Directors’ robust and long-term succession planning process,” said Mr Hassell. “Charlie is an accomplished and distinguished leader, with a record of profitably growing businesses, driving innovation and managing complex, large-scale global financial services organizations.”Mr Scharf, 52, was most recently chief executive of Visa and prior to that has done stints at JPMorgan Chase, first as head of the bank’s retail financial services and later as managing director of One Equity Partners, the bank’s private investment arm.“Under Charlie’s leadership, Visa transformed its technology platform by opening access to its network and capabilities, partnered with the world’s leading technology companies to drive new payment experiences, introduced new technologies to improve payment system security and built a world-class management team,” added Mr Hassell. “Charlie is ideally suited to lead BNY Mellon through the next phase of growth.”Mr Hassell became BNY Mellon’s CEO in August 2011. Under his tenure, shares in the company have more than doubled from $25 a share to a record high of $52.50 last Friday, giving it a market value of $54.8bn.The stock added another 2.4 per cent in pre-market trading on Monday on news of Mr Scharf’s appointment.
37;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-07-13T21:43:32Z;Yellen signals Fed may relax crisis-era bank safety rule;Custody banks could be biggest winners if regulator eases bank leverage ratio;Janet Yellen has given the strongest signal yet that regulators are planning to relax a contentious financial safety standard for big banks that executives have complained could perversely encourage them to take more risk.Custody banks including State Street and Bank of New York Mellon would be among the potential beneficiaries of the move by the Federal Reserve to reduce requirements under the “enhanced supplementary leverage ratio” (eSLR).Devised as part of the global Basel III reforms, the ratio tries to pick up on potential threats to the financial system that are not covered by other measures of bank capital.Backers say it is an important way for regulators to ensure banks have big enough buffers to absorb unexpected losses. Critics counter the metric is too blunt and has perverse consequences. It treats risky assets, such as subprime car loans, the same as safe holdings, such as cash parked with the Fed.Ms Yellen, the Fed chair, was asked by senators during testimony on Capitol Hill about the measure, which they said was negatively affecting custody banks and could lead to higher costs for customers. Ms Yellen suggested the Fed was considering whether to lower these levels for the biggest banks.“Perhaps it is too high relative to risk based capital requirements,” she said. “It is something where perhaps our regulations had an unintended consequence and we are looking at that carefully . . . It should not be what drives decision making in firms.”The supplementary leverage ratio and its enhanced version are new “catch all” measures that require banks to have enough loss-absorbing capital to cover their total leverage exposure. That makes them tougher than other standards because they prevent banks from assigning less capital to activities deemed to be lower risk. They also include exposure to assets banks hold off balance sheet. Custody banks, which hold a high proportion of low risk assets, are seen as being particularly hard hit.Executives at some large American banks are particularly unhappy about the “enhanced” version that is being adopted by Washington. US regulators are requiring the eight US banks that are considered to be “systemically important” — including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as well as the big custodians — to have additional cushions under the standard. Their capital must be worth at least 6 per cent of their total leverage exposure, double that of smaller banking groups.While the eSLR does not formally take effect until next year, the Fed tested bank balance sheets under the SLR in its recent stress test*. All banks tested would continue to meet the required standard in a simulated market meltdown, but the margin of safety for some banks — Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and State Street — came within a couple of percentage points of breaching required levels.The Trump administration has already warned the ratio could undermine market stability. In a paper on financial deregulation last month, the Treasury said it was “important to address unfavourable impacts these requirements may have on market liquidity and low-risk assets”. Under the Treasury’s mooted liberalisation, safe assets including central bank deposits would be excluded from the calculation.Ms Yellen’s response suggested the Fed was minded to reduce the level of the requirement, instead of how it is calculated. Particular relief could be targeted at custodians, she indicated. “We are in touch and aware of issues faced by the custody banks,” she said. “It is one of the reasons we are looking at the issue of the appropriate calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for those banks.”Before he left the Fed in April, Daniel Tarullo, the central bank’s former regulation chief, suggested regulators could create a sliding scale for the eSLR to ease the burden on custody banks. He said he opposed going down an alternative route that would strip out riskless assets such as ultra-safe central bank reserves from requirement. The Fed is considering ways of easing the burden of financial regulations as both the Trump administration and Congress seek ways of dialling back crisis-era reforms. The Fed has opened the door to change to the central bank’s stress tests, and Ms Yellen has suggested there may be ways of simplifying the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from gambling with their own customers’ money. Ms Yellen said a lot of the suggestions in the Treasury’s report on regulation were similar to measures the Fed was pursuing to better target the central bank’s regulations. However asked by Democratic senator Sherrod Brown whether some of the suggestions could go too far and increase the danger of a new financial crisis, Ms Yellen said certain of them could.* An earlier version of this article said the banks were tested against the eSLR. It has been amended.
38;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-07-08T05:02:54Z;Fund manager performance fees under attack;UK regulator, advisers and consumer groups say charges do not benefit investors;There were many elements of the UK regulator’s sweeping investigation of the asset management industry that senior investment professionals anticipated. But there was one small section of the regulator’s 114-page summary of its investigation, released last month, that caught asset managers by surprise: its stinging attack on the performance fees charged by some UK fund managers.These fees, which are typically triggered when a fund manager outperforms a benchmark or beats a specified return target, have long been criticised by consumer advocates and a number of financial advisers as being opaque, confusing and rarely beneficial for investors. Mark Dampier, research director at Hargreaves Lansdown, the FTSE 100 investment company, says: “You have to be careful with the great majority of performance fees. They are not transparent at all, and no one understands them. I don’t think [these fees] align the interests of the fund manager with their clients’. They align the interests of the fund manager with their profits.” The Financial Conduct Authority has added weight to such claims. It said some fund managers claimed their objective was to beat an ambitious benchmark, but charged a performance fee — typically 10 to 20 per cent of any outperformance — against a much lower target. Other UK funds take a performance fee before costs, such as trading charges or stamp duty, are applied, according to the watchdog. This contravenes FCA guidelines, which state that performance fees should be calculated “after consideration of all other payments”. The watchdog intends to consult on whether the rules around performance fees need tightening to end such practices. For many in the industry who are concerned about retail investors’ ability to comprehend these fees, this consultation could not come soon enough. Ryan Hughes, head of fund selection at AJ Bell, the online investment company, says: “Philosophically, I much prefer those funds without performance fees. There is absolutely room for reform in this part of the industry.” A retail investor would not understand the intricacies of how these fees workAlan Miller, co-founder of SCM Direct, the investment boutique that has long campaigned against hidden charges, adds that performance fees are incredibly complex. “If you are a professional investor, you go in with your eyes wide open. A retail investor would not understand the intricacies of how these fees work.” FTfm analysis of performance fees charged by funds across Europe demonstrates widespread differences in how these structures are applied. It also highlighted confusing terminology, a lack of information on how these charges are triggered and the use of benchmarks that many financial advisers consider inappropriate. The £591m Absolute Insight fund run by Insight Investments, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon, is one example of a product that comes with confusing performance-fee disclosures, according to an investment analyst who requested anonymity.The fund states on the first page of its key investor information document (Kiid) — which is meant to provide a simple overview of a fund’s characteristics — that its objective is to deliver returns of cash plus 4 per cent. On the second page of the document, it states that a 10 per cent performance fee will apply “on any returns the fund achieves above 3 month GBP Libor minus 0.125 per cent”. With the three-month sterling Libor rate currently at 0.3 per cent, this means the fund needs to achieve a return of 0.175 per cent in order to trigger a performance fee.“Not exactly stretching,” says the analyst. “It is easy to see why the FCA wants to look at performance fees when you see this ambiguity.” Another version of the same fund is benchmarked against the one-month Euribor index, which is currently at -0.37 per cent.This means the fund could theoretically earn a performance fee even if it returned 0 per cent. A spokesperson for Insight Investments says: “The Absolute Insight fund’s investment objective and approach is, we believe, clearly described in the fund’s documentation.” Janus Henderson’s £2.1bn Absolute Return Fund has also been criticised for a lack of clarity around its charging structure. Its Kiid states that it takes a 20 per cent performance fee under “certain conditions”. Its fact sheet says this fee is applied on returns “relative to the hurdle rate and high water mark”, without explaining there what these metrics are.On page 82 of the fund’s 127-page prospectus, Janus Henderson clarifies that its hurdle — the target it must beat to trigger a performance fee — is the Bank of England base rate, which is currently 0.25 per cent.By contrast, Old Mutual’s £6bn Absolute Return fund states its hurdle — the three-month Swiss franc Libor interest rate — in its Kiid.The investment analyst says: “There is a broader point for regulators everywhere to make sure performance fees are fair, transparent and written in a way everyone can understand. The language that is written around performance fees could be much, much clearer.” 6%Proportion of equity funds in Europe that charge a performance fee using an easy-to-beat cash benchmarkThe performance-fee criticisms are not limited to the UK market. According to Fitz Partners, the consultancy, 6 per cent of equity funds in Europe that charge a performance fee use an easy-to-beat cash benchmark, such as Libor or Euribor, to earn this additional income. “Performance fees are not inherently bad, but some are not structured properly,” says Hugues Gillibert, chief executive of Fitz. “Using a cash index should just not happen.” The €96m UBS long/short equity fund is one example of a product that charges a performance fee against an extremely low target. Its 20 per cent performance fee is paid on any return above the Euro OverNight Index Average benchmark, which is currently at -0.357 per cent. The performance fee is not referenced at all in the fund’s fact sheet, although it is explained in the Kiid. UBS declined to comment. And it is not just unsophisticated investors who struggle to understand performance-fee structures. A European investor who has worked in financial services for more than two decades says he felt misled by a small Luxembourg asset management company called Vam when he invested in its emerging market equity fund three years ago. The fund’s fact sheet stated that it applies a 15 per cent performance fee “on growth in excess of a hurdle rate of 12 per cent per annum”. According to the fund’s annual report, it produced a negative performance of -13.2 per cent in 2015, marginally better than the benchmark return of -14.6 per cent. The fund applied a performance fee of $408,749 for that year’s return. The investor says: “[Fund] managers need to be clear on what their fees actually are. Retail clients look at a fact sheet that says there is a 1 per cent annual management charge, and they have no concept of what the total expenses are.”A financial adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, says it took him more than an hour to understand the fund’s performance fee by reading its fact sheet, prospectus and annual report. He concluded that the fund uses an unusual but legal mechanism that means its managers receive a performance fee when the fund is up more than 12 per cent over any 365 day period and this is assessed every single day. The performance fee is paid to its managers every quarter, and is not reduced in periods of negative performance. This means the fund will charge a performance fee even if it has underperformed its benchmark, as has been the case on a regular basis.Vam says the fee formula “was implemented after detailed discussion and approval from both the board of directors and the Luxembourg regulator, and is similar to fees levied by several other, much larger, funds”.But the adviser believes the fee structure’s formula is “way outside the norm”. He adds: “Here we have a serial underperformer with very high charges and a structure that is not necessarily in investors’ best interests. Then investors are paying through the nose for that consistent underperformance.” To address such issues, many in the industry believe the practice of charging a performance fee against a cash benchmark should be outlawed, and that no fund should be able to earn such a fee gross of other charges.Fund fact sheets and investor documents also ought to include more information explaining when a performance fee is applied and whether it could be triggered after incurring negative or flat returns.“It does not stand up to any form of justice that you can charge a performance fee for not making the client any money,” Mr Miller says.

This week authorities notified a Chinese bank that it would be unable to access the US financial system because of allegations it was helping the regime launder money.All eight banks declined to comment apart from HSBC, which said in a statement: “We are co-operating with the authorities and have no further comment on an ongoing legal matter.”
40;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-04-23T16:42:14Z;UK watchdog warns against scrapping US rules for failing lenders;FCA chief says regulators will lose faith in how US handles crises if regime changes;Global regulatory co-operation would be threatened if the US dismantled its regime for failing banks, the UK financial watchdog has warned as the Trump administration takes aim at “too big to fail” lenders.Andrew Bailey, head of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, said foreign regulators would lose confidence in the way the US dealt with a banking crisis if it scrapped its system for the orderly handling of collapsing banks.President Donald Trump signed an order on Friday that opens the door to overhauling the fund set up in the Dodd-Frank reforms to help regulators shut failing banks, following claims by Republican lawmakers that the regime encouraged dangerous risk-taking. The UK is watching developments closely, given that its financial sector hosts big US banking groups. “We would have to say do we really think there is a resolution mechanism in there that we would have confidence . . . has got what it needs to be effective?” Mr Bailey said in an interview with the Financial Times on Friday in Washington. “Unfortunately, if you can’t answer that question in the affirmative then you are undermining . . . the consensus in terms of direction of travel that has emerged in recent years. It is quite fundamental.” Mr Bailey’s concerns expose a broader anxiety among policymakers over the potential unravelling of global collaboration on financial regulation amid Mr Trump’s “America First” campaign. Speaking at an event on the sidelines of the IMF’s twice-yearly meetings in Washington on Thursday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England and chair of the Financial Stability Board, which advises on the co-ordination of global financial regulation, urged policymakers not to take the “low road” towards fragmenting global rules. His stance was supported by Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of Banque de France, who said “any temptation of competitive deregulation will be a lose-lose game”.Tim Adams, chief executive of the Institute for International Finance lobby group, wrote last week to US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, saying a repeal of Title II — the orderly liquidation element of Dodd-Frank — would destroy the ability of foreign authorities to count on well-co-ordinated resolution planning with the US.Jennifer Xi, managing director in the office of regulatory affairs at BNY Mellon, told a conference last week it would be a “nightmare” if the bank had to manage its business subject to different standards in different parts of the world. Mr Bailey said relations between the UK and US regulators following Mr Trump’s inauguration were continuing as normal, pointing to recent work with US counterparts over swaps. It was not the UK’s place to say “which pieces of Dodd-Frank they should lift up and examine”, he said. However, he warned that Title II had global ramifications. “Frankly, if we were left with a bankruptcy code-only solution there it would be worrying,” he said. Tackling “too big to fail” was going to take time, and it was important to let the work run. “If that got disrupted badly, and I hope it won’t, I really hope it won’t, that would be the element that I think would be problematic internationally.” Some Republicans argue provisions to handle banks that capsize need to be rewritten because they unfairly shelter them from bankruptcy and institutionalise bailouts. Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House financial services committee, on Friday welcomed Mr Trump’s review, saying the existing system was “absurd and unfair to hardworking taxpayers”.But this logic was attacked by Paul Volcker, former chair of the Federal Reserve. “Under the [orderly liquidation provisions] the failing institution will, by any reasonable definition of the word, have in fact failed,” he said. “It is the absence of the resolution framework that might inexorably lead some future government to rescue big failing financial institutions. Apparently that is not fully understood or felt to be credible by some in Congress.”Mr Volcker added: “What needs to be understood is that the existing approach has been developed in concert with other leading international regulatory authorities . . . This is an area where a common methodology is critically important internationally.” Another preoccupation for Mr Bailey as he surveys the international regulatory landscape is preparation for Brexit. While stressing the complexity of the forthcoming negotiations, the FCA chief said he had become more optimistic about an arrangement ultimately being struck that would ease the impact on the City of London. “There was quite a lot of angry rhetoric in the post-referendum period,” he said. “Some of that has calmed down, and you do get more people saying we really need to find a solution to this which preserves open markets.” While stressing that nothing was in the bag, he commented that “the mood music has changed a bit”. “Were that to translate into an agreement which has equivalence and open markets it means the significance of Brexit for the City is substantially lessened.”

42;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-03-10T05:01:55Z;Why directed trusts can be effective in asset management;Its objective is to prevent misunderstandings and lawsuits by spelling out the responsibilities of trustees more clearly;Encouraged by some bitter and expensive battles between beneficiaries and trustees, directed trusts have spread in recent years like the prairie wildfires of South Dakota, one of the leading states in this field.The directed trust is an initiative designed to prevent misunderstandings and lawsuits by spelling out the responsibilities of trustees more clearly.David Diamond, president of the Wilmington, Delaware office of Northern Trust Wealth Management, says that about half of the trusts he has helped set up for clients in recent years have been directed, at least in part and he thinks the proportion is growing.Todd Flubacher, trust specialist and partner at Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell, a Wilmington law firm, estimates that the “overwhelming majority” of trust cases he now deals with involve directed trusts.The purpose and nature of directed trusts can perhaps be understood best by considering what can happen when trusts are not directed.Experts cite Matter of Hunter, a 2010 case in which the trust beneficiary won damages against the trustees for failing to sell stock in Kodak, which accounted for the bulk of the trust’s assets, even while the company edged ever closer towards bankruptcy. The court found that a prudent trustee should have diversified the trust’s assets.Responding to cases such as these, trustees have sought clearer direction about what they should do — aware of the tension arising from the fact that many trusts have a concentration in a single stock or high-value asset. Worse still, if that asset is a functioning company set up by the person who established the trust, a wealth manager acting as a trustee may have no capacity to monitor it competently, though some wealth managers, including Northern Trust, have specialist teams to do this.The solution is the directed trust, described by Joan Crain, global family wealth strategist at BNY Mellon, as a reaction “first and foremost to the litigious nature of the US”.Most commonly, the wealth manager has discretionary power to manage the part of the trust made up of liquid securities. For other assets, however, often termed “special assets”, the trustee acts only at the written direction of another adviser.This might, for example, be a member of the family who knows how to monitor the family company. Crain, who helped draft a directed trust law for Florida, says: “What pushed me into getting involved was the fact that I was getting calls from families’ attorneys saying: ‘BNY Mellon, we’d love you to be trustee and by the way there’s a family business that will be part of what you’re trustee for, but the family doesn’t want you getting involved with that.’”Other common cases where directed trusts are used are for property and for a large holding in a single company, as in the Hunter case.Advocates of directed trusts say that they are good for the trustee, as they protect them from being sued successfully. A recent case in Delaware, the most common jurisdiction for US trusts, R Leigh Duemler versus Wilmington Trust Company, confirmed this. Advocates argue that the trust beneficiary gains too. This is partly because, by clearly defining responsibilities, directed trusts lead to better management of assets.Advocates of directed trusts say that they are good for the trustee, as they protect them from being sued successfullyIt is also because trustees may enjoy lower fees. “One of the advantages of directed trusts is that in a state with a good directed trust statute, trustees do not monitor or second-guess the investment adviser in charge of special assets,” says Flubacher.“Let’s say you have a family business worth $50m and you put it in a trust. If the trustee had overall responsibility, they would conduct exhaustive due diligence over every stockholder decision and charge you 1 per cent a year, or $500,000. In the case of a directed trust, where there was no duty to monitor, they might only charge you $10,000.”Flubacher says that 22 states, including Delaware, do not require the trustees to monitor the assets even if a separate adviser is tasked with managing them. He says that the 21 jurisdictions (including Washington DC) with “pretty ineffective” laws that require monitoring are best avoided by people setting up trusts. That leaves only eight states with no directed trust statutes at all.There are, however, sceptics about directed trusts. These include, to a degree, Crain of BNY Mellon, whose experience is different from Diamond’s and Flubacher’s. “It’s popular as a concept, but in terms of people actually going ahead, it’s not as common as one might have thought,” she says.Crain estimates that directed trusts are considered for about one-third of the trusts she sees, but created for only about one-quarter of such cases. She cites the double layer of fees in instances where the trustee is still under an obligation to monitor the asset, as they are in her home state of Florida, and the lack of testing of the directed trusts in case law, notwithstanding the Duemler case.Most of all, Crain cites the “really good market”, in recent years, in the sale of family-owned small and medium-sized companies to larger corporations. If the market becomes less buoyant, more of these businesses may end up in directed trusts.

44;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2017-01-25T16:41:05Z;JPMorgan wins $1tn custody mandate from BlackRock;Wall Street group to overtake State Street as world’s No 2 custodian bank;JPMorgan Chase looks set to leapfrog State Street to become the world’s No 2 custody bank after picking up $1tn of new assets from BlackRock.The mandate, one of the largest in the industry’s history, is a blow to State Street, which currently looks after the assets, sending its shares lower on Wednesday.Jay Hooley, chief executive of State Street, said he was disappointed at BlackRock’s decision, but understood that it wanted to diversify its custodian banks after many years of growth. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with more than $5tn in assets.“We have been joined at the hip with them through their successful journey of asset growth,” Mr Hooley told analysts on a conference call, adding that BlackRock’s fast-growing iShares exchange traded funds business would continue to use State Street’s services.BlackRock presented the shift as a simple matter of cost. “Today’s action is yet another example of BlackRock’s commitment to maximise the benefits of scale,” said Derek Stein, head of business operations and technology. “Many of BlackRock’s clients will experience cost savings through decreased operating expenses at the fund level.”State Street reported custody assets of $21.7tn on Wednesday, while JPMorgan said earlier this month that it looked after assets of $20.5tn. It will take up to two years to transfer the $1tn of BlackRock assets, the companies said.BNY Mellon continues to be market leader, although it does not break out a number for assets under custody specifically. Last week it said that its assets under custody and administration were $29.9tn.Custody banks’ services to asset owners and fund managers include the safekeeping and settlement of securities and other administration, and as such they are central to the plumbing of the financial system.Mr Hooley predicted the loss of BlackRock’s business would be a “one-off” and that the big custody banks would continue to win market share, as clients reduce the number of providers to cut costs.State Street countered the BlackRock news with a press release saying that Allianz Global Investors, another client, was expanding the services it buys from State Street, which include fund administration, custody, share class hedging and data services covering €450bn of Allianz GI assets.Nonetheless, the bank’s shares were down 4 per cent in mid-morning trading. “There are always some puts and takes, but I cannot remember the last one this big,” said Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI.State Street reported net income of $557m for the fourth quarter, up 1.8 per cent on the previous year, on flat revenue of $2.5bn. Within that, fee revenue was down 1.5 per cent at $2bn.JPMorgan has been trying to expand its custody business — and eyeing State Street’s No 2 slot — to generate revenues that can be less volatile than retail and investment banking. At its last investor day, Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s commercial and investment bank, called custody “a very good, very stable earning business”.Analysts said the BlackRock transfer could have an outsized impact. “Investors will fear that this is a ‘statement win’ by JPMorgan, proving their capabilities are on par with the big trust banks and that they could be coming after this business in a bigger way,” said Glenn Schorr at Evercore.

46;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-12-01T06:03:17Z;The next frontier for greater inclusion in financial services;Networks, temporary teams and two kinds of mentor all help new faces to fit in;Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO), a New York non-profit organisation, has been offering training and mentoring to junior investment banking analysts from under-represented groups since 2009.Its aim, along with its sister organisation in London, is to enable them to secure posts in private equity firms and other alternative investment companies, such as venture capital firms and hedge funds.“We reverse-engineered it. We looked at the knowledge and skills gaps [in the sector] and built the programme to address them,” says Julian Johnson, executive vice-president at SEO, which developed the programme with private equity groups KKR and TPG.However, acquiring technical skills is only one of the hurdles that minority groups may face when entering the financial sector.“One of the biggest challenges people from under-represented backgrounds have is fitting in. They don’t feel part of the club, whether that is the boys’ club, the white club or the wealthy club,” says Lauren Rivera, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management, who studies class, gender and racial bias in hiring and promotion decisions at investment banks and consulting and law firms.Fitting in matters because informal networks help people gain access to useful information and resources. “It presents a barrier not only to their work but also to being promoted,” says Prof Rivera.Researching her book Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs, she noted that, beyond core skills, hirers looked for what they might describe as “polish” — or “pedigree” — revealed in tiny social cues and cultural patterns.The financial services sector tends to be dominated by white men, often from privileged backgrounds. In 2014, a report by Mercer found that while 17 per cent of Chicago’s population was African-American and 21 per cent was Latino, the figures for their employment in the financial services sector were 12 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.Pamela Sandy, president of the US’s Financial Planning Association, a trade body, says her industry has been slower than others to increase workforce diversity because of “a culture that’s having a hard time changing”. She also cites vested interests: “When you have successful white males who have easily stepped into this profession and made a very good living because there was little competition, they’re protecting their territory.”Many financial services companies are working to counter this. Barclays, for example, measures diversity and inclusion in its balanced scorecard, its business performance management tool.Make sure people change offices so they can make connections with different peopleOne way institutions can support diverse groups is with workplace networks that connect employees of similar backgrounds, interests and experiences. JPMorgan Chase’s Adelante business resource group promotes professional development and leadership opportunities for Latino employees and provides networking across the US.Support groups exist outside the workplace, too. In the US, the Urban Financial Services Coalition backs career development for financial services professionals from minority groups by offering education and networking opportunities, as well as scholarships.Companies should also mix up the workforce, however. “Proximity is important,” says Prof Rivera. “It [involves] making sure people aren’t isolated physically and that they change offices regularly so they can make connections with people they wouldn’t normally interact with.”This should be the goal in mentoring too, she says. While mentors from similar backgrounds to their mentees provide insights into navigating an organisation, “often they don’t have connections with people in positions of power”.Prof Rivera advises companies to take a dual approach. “Individuals get a mentor who can give them social support but also one from a majority group, so they can get access to people who control the power in the organisation.”BNY Mellon enables access to senior executives through its Signature Leadership Forum, comprising networking events that allow promising employees from a range of backgrounds to highlight their skills. “It gives them opportunities to form peer networks across the company and to get exposure to senior leaders,” says Jyoti Chopra, global head of diversity and inclusion.Assembling teams of people from different backgrounds to work on particular projects also helps, as the bank found with its People Report. A series of stories told by staff, designed to showcase the bank’s talent strategy, it involved about 150 people from around the company, says Ms Chopra.Even more powerful unifiers are projects undertaken outside the office, such as volunteering programmes, says Ms Sandy. “If there is a common goal that is not just driven by work, it allows those walls to break down.”When it comes to staff from disadvantaged backgrounds, she adds, banks can help employees to feel more engaged by involving them in efforts to increase financial inclusion. “Young people from these backgrounds enter the profession with a passion to make a difference,” she says.
47;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-09-22T06:57:37Z;European bond markets get lift from Fed;;Central banks are back.European sovereign bond markets are getting a healthy lift on the back of action in the United States yesterday, where the Federal Reserve held back on a September rate hike and signalled its longer-term outlook for the fed funds rate had lowered.According to its much watched “dot plots” (see chart below) – which tracks where US rate-setters see interest rates up until 2019 – the Fed thinks it will carry out just one rate rise this year and two in 2017, down from an earlier projection of three.Dissent may have returned to the Federal Open Markets Committee – with three vote-setters in favour of a September rise – but the longer-term dovishness has given Europe’s bond prices a boost across the board this morning.“Given that at the start of 2016 the broad view was that the Fed would hike four times this year only for the reality to turn to be one move (at best), experience says there is a good chance that even these modest expectations could be scaled back further,” said Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon.Germany’s 10-year Bund yield, the benchmark for the eurozone, has slipped to a two-week low, shedding 4 basis points (0.04 percentage points) to -0.04 per cent. Its southern counterparts Italy and Spain have also seen yields fall by 5.8bps and 3.9bps respectively. (Yields fall when prices rise. Negative yields bake in a nominal loss for new buyers who hold to maturity.)Portuguese bonds, which have been under selling pressure in recent weeks over renewed fears about the state of its public finances, are also rejoicing in the Fed-induced rally. The yield on its 10-year debt has dropped 5.2bps to 3.351 per cent at publication time.US Treasuries have also continued their overnight rally, shedding 2 bps to a week’s low of 1.649 per cent.The move into sovereign bonds comes after a mini-sell off in the fixed income markets in recent months. According to Fitch ratings, the universe of negative-yielding sovereign debt has dropped by $1tn since June 27 to $10.9tn as investors have pushed up longer-term yields on the back of fears over the limits of global central bank easing and the prospect of higher inflation.
48;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-08-24T16:16:42Z;Blockchain offers banks the chance to rehabilitate their image;The big appeal is that the technology should save financial companies money, writes Patrick Jenkins;It is little wonder that the world’s big banks like to talk about the blockchain. Tarnished by the 2008 financial crisis, and in some cases still struggling to find a profitable business model for the future, it can only help for a UBS or a Deutsche Bank to be associated with cutting-edge technology. Whether there is more to this than good marketing is the question.Blockchain, the technology that facilitates the bitcoin alternative currency, certainly seems to offer opportunities for the financial system to streamline itself. In particular, the blockchain’s underpinning distributed ledger system should allow securities transactions to be settled more quickly and cheaply.UBS, Deutsche, Santander, BNY Mellon and ICAP this week became the latest posse of financial groups to collaborate on the development of a settlement blockchain. The initiative, dubbed the utility settlement coin or USC, is essentially a spinout from a mass blockchain collaboration, R3, which encompasses more than 50 financial groups worldwide. The broader R3 project is looking at dozens of areas in which the blockchain could revolutionise current technology, from identity checks to securities registration. A core securities settlement ledger is in advanced testing.Banks and their technology executives like to talk about the greater safety that will come with a “golden record” of trades — one ledger that updates in real time as trades are executed. They hope to get regulators onside by granting them sight of the ledger, as a result improving the quality and timeliness of regulatory data. But the big appeal to banks is that the new technology should save them money. That, at least, is the theory.First, there should be a cost saving, as a fully synchronised and digitised settlement operation makes cumbersome, labour intensive back offices redundant. Second, there should be a capital saving, as the time delay between transactions being executed and settled is reduced, ensuring assets do not hang around on balance sheets for longer than they need to. With banks under severe pressure on both fronts, any mitigant is welcome.There are snags, though. Testing the technology in laboratory conditions, as has happened so far, is a long way from making it work in a chaotic market environment. Even if it does work, it may not receive a swift go-ahead from the authorities. Some regulators have been gently encouraging up to now but, given that the main beneficiaries will be the banks, watchdogs will be in no rush to approve the initiatives. The latest project’s “early 2018” commercial launch plan looks extremely ambitious.Four of the world’s biggest banks are collaborating on a new blockchain project to transform the way securities trades are processed, with the aim of making it cheaper and safer. Patrick Jenkins asks Martin Arnold, the FT’s banking editor, to explain what’s behind the development.Banks, regulators and everyone else should be worried about some danger areas. Most serious is that the distributed ledger data, though secured through encryption, may be more systemically risky if miscreants or incompetents gain access to the single “golden record”.A similar argument may undermine cost-saving hopes. The whole reliance of the ledger system on automation and models may mean that in case of problems, the unpicking of misreported trades, or system outages, becomes more laborious and disruptive.Innovation in banking is still a tainted concept. Pre-2008 it was code for the absurd financial engineering behind the derivatives that ended up spreading financial crisis around the world. If banks are to have any chance of being rehabilitated, they must prove that blockchain innovation will not help them at the expense of everyone else.patrick.jenkins@ft.comA clear understanding of blockchain’s complexities will be key for banks / From Michael Thomas
49;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-08-24T15:32:36Z;Suits join the hoodies with blockchain push;Cost savings and low returns drive lenders into working with system underpinning bitcoin;Early bitcoin enthusiasts hailed the cryptocurrency as a revolutionary way to sideline banks in a libertarian drive to upend the traditional order of capitalism.Since then the banks have fought back. Nowadays most people attending conferences about the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin are more likely to be wearing suits than the hoodies and ripped jeans of a few years ago.Having kept their distance from bitcoin, fearing the risks of fraud and criminality, big banks now see huge potential benefits from harnessing the blockchain to make the existing financial system more efficient.“In today’s banking world, it is all about cost savings, as they are all struggling with low returns and that is why they are all locking on to the blockchain,” says Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture.The latest example of big banks organising themselves to exploit the potential of blockchain technology came this week with the announcement that four big lenders have teamed up to develop a “utility settlement coin” — a new form of digital cash.The four banks — UBS, Santander, Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon, which are working with UK broker ICAP and developer Clearmatics Technologies — stress that they are not creating a new cryptocurrency.Instead, the system they are developing uses blockchain technology to create different coins that are each directly convertible into existing currencies deposited at central banks. In essence, it is a way of putting dollars, euros and pounds on the blockchain.While other digital cash projects are being examined by banks — such as Citigroup’s Citicoin or Goldman Sachs’ “SETLcoin” — this is the first time several institutions have teamed up to create a digital cash utility for use in financial markets.So how does it work? And what problem is it trying to solve?The coins are stored on a network of computers, all of which must approve that a transaction has taken place before it is recorded in a “chain” of computer code. Cryptography is used to keep transactions secure and costs are shared by members.Details of transfers are recorded on a ledger that anyone on the network can see, eliminating the need for a central authority, which is why the technology has also been dubbed a “distributed ledger”.The aim is to speed up clearing and settlement in financial markets by allowing institutions to pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed in the so-called delivery-versus-payment process.Four of the world’s biggest banks are collaborating on a new blockchain project to transform the way securities trades are processed, with the aim of making it cheaper and safer. Patrick Jenkins asks Martin Arnold, the FT’s banking editor, to explain what’s behind the development.By switching clearing and settlement of financial markets on to a distributed ledger, the banks hope to do away with much of their costly back office operations that process trades and keep records up to date. Quicker settlement should also free up capital that banks hold against trading risk.Hyder Jaffrey, head of fintech innovation at UBS, says: “Every bank, exchange and clearing house, we all have our own sets of the same data, which get out of sync and have to be updated and reconciled.”“The distributed ledger is the first technology which could implement a shared golden copy of that data,” says Mr Jaffrey. “If you have that breakthrough you can really see how that would be revolutionary in the financial world.”Total savings from using blockchain technology in payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance could reach $15bn-$20bn a year by 2022, according to a recent report by Santander, Oliver Wyman and Anthemis.The consortium behind the universal settlement coin is aiming for a commercial launch by early 2018, by which time it expects to add many new members to its ranks, which are being kept small to retain flexibility.It plans to spend the next year winning over central banks and regulators, whose support is essential for the project to succeed. Central bankers are warming to the idea of digital currencies and some, such as the Bank of England, are actively working on creating their own — so they are likely to be supportive.As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currencyThe project, however, still faces many challenges. One is transaction speed. Bitcoin is often criticised for being unable to scale up because its blockchain can handle only about seven transactions a second, as opposed to, say, the 24,000 a second that Visa can. Any solution from the banks will have to be fast and capable of processing heavy loads.There is also a question over whether the banks will lose almost as much revenue as they save in costs. They make $1.7tn a year, or 40 per cent of total revenue, from global payment services, according to McKinsey. How much of that could be replaced by a blockchain payments solution?Finally, the proliferation of various blockchain projects among banks, already numbering in their hundreds, raises fears of whether they will coalesce around a single standard or end up using several incompatible technologies.“Everyone is hoping they can rise up and be the new Microsoft,” says Michael Parsons, a consultant advising big banks on the blockchain. “None of the banks in a consortium has a competitive advantage as they are sharing the information, but if they work separately they haven’t got economies of scale.”Some sceptics reckon the banks are missing the point. “This is banks talking to each other and the point of blockchain is to establish consensus in the presence of potentially untrusted actors, as with bitcoin, on the internet,” says Dave Birch, of payments consultancy Consult Hyperion. “It’s a sorry state of affairs, that technology is not going to fix, if the banks don’t trust each other. “The hoodie-wearing bitcoin pioneers may be despairing to see their creation hijacked by the big banks. But Mr Jaffrey at UBS says many people now working on the blockchain for banks started their careers on bitcoin projects.“In terms of the debate about hoodies versus the suits, a lot of the so-called hoodies are the ones working with the suits on these solutions,” he says. “We need their expertise.”
50;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-08-23T20:00:41Z;Big banks plan to coin new digital currency;Group of major lenders seeks industry standard for settlements;Four of the world’s biggest banks have teamed up to develop a new form of digital cash that they believe will become an industry standard to clear and settle financial trades over blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin.UBS, the Swiss bank, pioneered the “utility settlement coin” and has now joined forces with Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon — as well as the broker ICAP — to pitch the idea to central banks, aiming for its first commercial launch by early 2018.The move, to be announced on Wednesday, is one of the most concrete examples of banks co-operating on a specific blockchain technology to harness the power of decentralised computer networks and improve the efficiency of financial market plumbing.“Today trading between banks and institutions is difficult, time-consuming and costly, which is why we all have big back offices,” said Julio Faura, head of R&D and innovation at Santander. “This is about streamlining it and making it more efficient.”Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms that allows so-called cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — to be traded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger.Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets.The total cost to the finance industry of clearing and settling trades is estimated at $65bn-$80bn a year, according to a report last year by Oliver Wyman.There are several rival digital cash systems being developed. Setl, a London-based group founded by hedge fund investors and trading executives last year, also aims to settle financial market payments with digital cash linked directly to central banks. Citigroup is working on its own “Citicoin” solution, while Goldman Sachs has filed a patent for a “SETLcoin” to allow trades to be settled near-instantaneously. JPMorgan is also working on a similar project.As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currencyThe utility settlement coin, based on a solution developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial institutions pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. Instead they would use digital coins that are directly convertible into cash at central banks, cutting the time and cost of post-trade settlement and clearing.The coins, each convertible into different currencies, would be stored using the blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, allowing them to be quickly swapped for the financial securities being traded.“You need a form of digital cash on the distributed ledger in order to get maximum benefit from these technologies,” said Hyder Jaffrey, head of fintech innovation at UBS. “What that allows us to do is to take away the time these processes take, such as waiting for payment to arrive. That frees up capital trapped during the process.”Four of the world’s biggest banks are collaborating on a new blockchain project to transform the way securities trades are processed, with the aim of making it cheaper and safer. Patrick Jenkins asks Martin Arnold, the FT’s banking editor, to explain what’s behind the development.He said the project team would spend the next year seeking the approval and co-operation of regulators and central banks and aim for a “limited and low-risk” commercial launch by early 2018. The consortium members plan to argue that the system would improve transparency for regulators.The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada are among central banks examining the potential benefits of digital currencies. But concerns include the security and the impact on banking stability.David Treat, head of Accenture’s capital markets blockchain practice, said the technology was still at a stage of having “three to five years before we get things adopted at scale and several more years before it goes mainstream”.Blockchain technology will help auditing process / From Michael Izza

Only time will tell whether OPEC justifies the market’s optimism, but a more prudent approach is definitely warranted in the run up to the meeting next month – a conclusion the market may already have arrived at.
52;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-08-18T17:13:43Z;The hidden pipes of finance may be furring up;JPMorgan’s pullout of tri-party repo market shows impact of banks reshaping their business models;"A decade ago JPMorgan Chase looked like a financial octopus: its tentacles reached into almost every part of the Wall Street money machine. But some of those tentacles are now being trimmed.Take the tri-party repurchase (repo) market — the corner of modern finance where banks and others raise short-term loans backed by collateral while entities such as mutual funds use it to park their cash.Until now, JPMorgan has been a linchpin of this $1.6tn sector, since it settled and cleared these deals, acting as a bridge between clients. Its only rival was the mighty Bank of New York Mellon. But a couple of weeks ago JPMorgan bankers revealed that they plan to withdraw from key parts of this market in the US by the end of 2017 to focus on more profitable activities.The details are complex: essentially JPMorgan will stop settling trades in government bonds for 30 major brokers. But the key point is that most of the crucial tri-party repo sector will sit in the hands of BONY; John Pierpont Morgan might be spinning in his grave.Nobody outside Wall Street has yet paid much attention. To most people the tri-party repo sector is akin to household plumbing — deeply unglamorous and easy to ignore unless the system breaks down and creates a mess.But, just like plumbing, it matters a great deal whether or not tri-party repo works. When the market seized up in 2008, this created panic among banks, investors and the companies that rely on it for funds. And right now there are at least three reasons why we should pay attention to JPMorgan’s move.First, and most obviously, it underscores the pressure on all investment banks — including even the supposedly successful ones — to rethink their business models as financial reforms bite and interest rates sink ever lower. A decade ago it would have been hard to imagine a world where JPMorgan abandoned tri-party repo — just as it was hard to picture Goldman Sachs creating a retail bank. Now all manner of taboos are tumbling on Wall Street.Second, the move also raises questions about the structure of tri-party repo itself. Since JPMorgan announced its withdrawal, US regulators have been trying to reassure financiers and company treasurers that Bony will be able to manage the transition in a calm, orderly way and that it is aware of its systemic responsibilities.Perhaps so. Bony appears to be a strong bank. But it looks odd to have such an important corner of finance organised as a monopoly in the hands of a private-sector bank. After all, Wall Street is supposed to promote free-market competition and regulators are supposed to dislike concentrations of risk.So, if nothing else, this shift calls for a wider debate. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the New York Federal Reserve introduced reforms to make the market function more effectively. It should go further and ask whether it is time to use a big industry-owned utility to settle and clear trades instead, such as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation; alternatively, it could encourage new entrants or look at other solutions.But the third crucial point that JPMorgan’s move highlights is the degree to which some of the hidden pipes of finance may be furring up as the banks reshape their business models. The US repo market (of which the tri-party piece is one part) is $2.2tn, according to a review by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, with a similarly large market in Europe. That sounds impressively big. However, daily turnover is about half the level of a decade ago partly because there is less demand for credit, but also because of a reduction in the numbers of brokers and others who organise deals or provide inventories of collateral.That might not matter immediately; the market is functioning fairly smoothly. But the Bank of England has just published a sobering piece of research suggesting that, if another financial shock hits, it may be hard for the industry to obtain enough high-quality collateral to borrow funds. This, in turn, might cause the wider financing channels in the repo world and elsewhere to freeze in potentially dangerous ways. Models suggest this tipping point is reached if the Vix index — a gauge of investors’ expected volatility — remains at 44 per cent for three months.Thankfully, there is no sign that this is imminent. The Vix is extremely low, and funding is flowing through the financial channels smoothly, in the tri-party repo world and elsewhere. But it is better to do a safety check on a plumbing system before a crisis hits rather than when there is a nasty blockage.JPMorgan’s move could be a perfect excuse for regulators and bankers on both sides of the Atlantic to start a wider debate about the repo world. They should use it.gillian.tett@ft.com"
53;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-08-14T09:02:18Z;The week’s news in brief: August 15;The Investment Association says hidden fees are the ‘Loch Ness monster’ of the investment market;• Helena Morrissey is to step aside as chief executive of Newton Investment Management after 15 years in charge of the UK asset manager to take up the role of non-executive chairman for a limited period. She will be succeeded by Hanneke Smits, a former head of investments at Adams Street Partners, the Chicago-based private equity manager.Well known for her interests outside of asset management, Ms Morrissey established the 30% Club in 2010, an organisation that campaigns for greater gender diversity in boardrooms. She also argued passionately in favour of Brexit, although Newton’s parent company, BNY Mellon, later instructed all staff to avoid commenting publicly on the UK referendum before the June vote. This fuelled speculation of a rift between Ms Morrissey and her employer.• Bill Miller, once the most famous stockpicker in the US, is leaving Legg Mason, the investment manager where he has worked for 35 years.Mr Miller ran the Legg Mason Value Trust, which outperformed the S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years before his run of success came to an abrupt end in 2005. The former military intelligence officer relinquished management of his fund in 2012 after its assets shrank by almost 90 per cent.Mr Miller last week bought Legg Mason’s stake in LMM, their $1.8bn joint venture.• Fund managers hit back at accusations that investors are being penalised by hidden fees and charges, claiming there is “zero evidence” of such a problem in the industry, according to a study published last week by the Investment Association.The trade body, which represents UK asset managers, said hidden fees were the “Loch Ness monster” of the investment market because all charges are stated in the annual reports produced by funds. But the study angered consumer rights campaigners, who accused the IA of publishing self-serving and misleading research.• Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, predicted that blue-collar workers will vote for Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election.Mr Icahn said government regulations were “absolutely killing business” during television interviews and that it was “extremely important” to see Mr Trump win.• The UK’s former pensions minister called for parliament to launch an inquiry into corporate pensions, saying retirement schemes have been pushed into a funding crisis.UK corporate pension deficits have risen to almost £1tn, and Baroness Ros Altmann said the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates and launch a fresh round of bond buying could push some schemes “over the edge”.• Legal & General last week sold Cofunds for £140m to Aegon in a deal that makes the Dutch insurer the biggest player in the UK’s investment platform market. L&G will incur a loss of around £65m on the disposal of Cofunds, the main investment platform for UK financial advisers, which has £77bn in assets under administration.• The amount of new money raised by exchange traded funds exposed to global stock markets dropped 85 per cent in the first half of 2016, in a rare sign of pressure on the passive investment industry.Equity ETFs that track an index attracted a net $15bn from investors in the first half of this year, a significant decline on the $102bn invested over the same period in 2015.Analysts blamed the drop in inflows on volatile trading conditions in January and February, followed by concerns about the impact of the UK’s vote on EU membership.
54;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-08-09T15:02:23Z;Oh so quiet: old-fashioned summer lull sets in;;After a Brexit-fuelled bumpy start, the summer lull has well and truly set in. In fact, it’s turning out to be one of the calmest Augusts of the last decade.In stark contrast to last August, when the renminbi devaluation sent shockwaves through markets, this August has been remarkably placid so far.Global equities rebounded swiftly from the post-referendum plunge. The FTSE 100 has rallied to a 14-month high, the Dax has raced into a bull market and the S&P 500 has surged to all-time highs.The Vix index, which tracks S&P 500 implied volatility, has dived to a two-year low of 11.31, writes Joel Lewin.So far this month it has averaged 12.18, down from an average of 19.42 last August and the lowest August average in at least 16 years, according to fastFT analysis of Bloomberg data.So far this month the S&P500 has gained 0.5 per cent, buoyed by a rotation from bonds into equities and an accelerating rally in tech stocks. Last August it plunged 6.3 per cent, its worst monthly drop in three years and its worst August drop in 14 years as China angst rattled markets.This summer disappointing second quarter US growth data pushed expectations for the next Federal Reserve rate rise back into next year, which has helped bestow calm on currency markets.Euro/dollar two-week implied volatility, which tracks the theoretical price of protecting against swings in the single currency against the greenback, has plunged to a near two-year low of 6.235.So far this month it has averaged 6.715, which is the second lowest August average in the last nine years, according to fastFT analysis of Bloomberg data.Mark Tinker at AXA says:Markets have settled down a little as post Brexit volatility worked its way through the system. The panic over Chinese growth in Q1 has subsided, as have the commodity prices that temporarily spiked in Q2 as the more aggressive macro traders were caught out.Monetary authorities meanwhile continue to remain trapped in a world of ever more monetary loosening even though the efficacy of ultra low rates, and especially of asset purchases, is coming into question.Deutsche Bank’s global currency volatility index has averaged 9.39 so far this month, down from an August average of 9.72 last year.As Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon highlights, the crucial difference has been the relatively sanguine attitude of markets towards renminbi devaluation this summer, a stark contrast to last summer when it sent markets into turmoil.Mr Derrick writes:It is important to note that in recent months the CNY has broadly resumed its weakening trend against a number of currencies (most notably the USD and the JPY). Moreover, in marked contrast to the period between late 2014 and the start of this year, there has been no sign of a significant drain from China’s FX reserves in recent months (they have essentially flat-lined since February).Simply put, with the spotlight having shifted away from Chinese FX policy in recent months (speculators and finance officials globally have had plenty of other issues to focus on) it appears that Beijing has been happy to step back and allow the markets to function normally. A weakening CNY has been the net result of this. Moreover, China appears to have allowed it to happen without stirring any major concerns amongst investors.So what could shake markets out of this sleepy lull?Perhaps the very thing that has helped induce it: easy money.Paul Meggyesi at JPMorgan says the end of relentless central bank stimulus, as hinted at by Japan’s recent emphasis on fiscal over monetary support, could be problematic:Low volatility and a dearth of major policy events over the coming month is not a particularly fertile environment for macro trading. One theme that’s worth pursuing is the end of easy money. This issue has been an intermittent driver of markets since the taper tantrum in 2013, and with investors now more circumspect about the scope for additional ECB and BoJ easing, could sponsor bounded strength in EUR and JPY ahead of next month’s policy meets.Incrementalism has fed a deeper suspicion that easy money policies are nearing their limits, in turn risking a high-volatility spike in yields and/or exchange rates from artificially-low levels.Like Treasuries during the 2013 taper tantrum, Bunds and JGBs are delivering occasional volatility shocks due to overvalued markets and fears of a regime change
55;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

State Street’s rival, BNY Mellon, paid $714m last year to settle similar allegations. State Street’s $2.3tn asset management arm on Wednesday reported net outflows of $35bn from its funds in the second quarter.● Hedge funds suffered net outflows of $20.7bn in June as investors pulled out more money in spite of evidence that market volatility associated with the UK’s Brexit vote had boosted the performance of some managers.Investors pulled $10.7bn from hedge funds over the three months to the end of June amid rising dissatisfaction with high fees and disappointing returns.● Deutsche Bank has appointed Nicolas Moreau to head up its asset management arm following the departure of Quintin Price.Mr Moreau joins Deutsche Asset Management from Axa, where he was in charge of operations in France.
57;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-07-29T15:35:55Z;US Q2 GDP disappointment — economists react;;US second quarter growth came in well below expectations today, fuelling a reassessment of rate rise expectations and hitting the dollar. Here’s a round up of what economists are saying.The US economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.2 per cent in the three months to the end of June, a modest acceleration from 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, but less than half the 2.5 per cent forecast by economists.Steve Murphy at Capital Economics has slashed his 2016 US growth forecast to 1.5 per cent from 2 per cent. He says:What is really worrying is that pace has still been enough to reduce the unemployment rate further, suggesting that the economy’s potential growth rate could conceivably be close to zero. Productivity growth, the single biggest driver of real living standards, has been even weaker than we previously feared.“Janet Yellen will continue to sit on the fence with interest rates for the foreseeable future,” says Alex Lydall at Foenix Partners, the FX services group.Market expectations that the Fed will raise rates before the end of the year have indeed dropped from 45 per cent to 37 per cent in the wake of the data.Mr Lydall adds:Rhetoric from the Federal Reserve lately has been somewhat cautious, meaning the significant miss of growth figures will put the bearish committee members back in the driving seat. With global risk appetite tentative on the back of the EU Referendum results, the global powerhouse of the US is often seen as a precursor to global performance.If these preliminary figures signify a shift on the downside for the domestic economy in the US, not only will rate hikes be unlikely this year, but the benchmark for global risk will be adversely affected in the medium term.Marvin Loh at BNY Mellon highlights a few bright spots:Inventory drawdowns were a large part of the negative results, subtracting almost 1.2% from the results, which theoretically will reverse and provide support for stronger 3Q results. Other positives were the continued strong consumer, with personal consumption increasing 4.2%, just shy of the 4.4%But ultimately he views the data as “further evidence that the economy is just barely chugging along and running well below trend,” and said it raises “the spectre that the weakening employment indicators may not rebound as many expect.”He adds:The results were well below expectations and does not provide much ammunition for the Fed to consider getting more aggressive on its rate hike path. While the market had started to reconsider hikes this year, we think that the Fed is highly data dependent in a post-Brexit environment and interpreted its policy statement this week as such.We still have no rate hike expectations for the remainder of the year and this data point is indicative of how hard it will be for the Fed to confidently raise funds again.On the other hand Johnny Bo Jakobsen at Nordea Bank highlights the fact private sector wages excluding incentive pay rose 2.6 per cent year on year in the second quarter, the strongest pace in seven years.He writes:The clear uptrend in underlying wage pressures is consistent with a labour market fast approaching full employment and an US economy in the later stage of the cycle. The fact that the Fed’s employment and inflation targets appear to have been met (or are close to being met) gives more weight to the view that the Fed will resume normalising monetary policy later this year.
58;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-07-21T13:44:17Z;ECB holds, Draghi speaks out on bank rescues: analysts react;;"Sometimes doing nothing does a lot.As expected, the ECB has kept interest rates steady for the fourth consecutive month, but ECB president Mario Draghi’s subsequent comments about the possibility of setting up a public rescue fund for rescuing banks are making waves, with bank stocks and Italian bond yields both climbing.Here’s what ECB-watchers are making of it all:Pantheon Macroeconomics was unimpressed with the lack of new information, but expects people to focus on the possibility of a public backstop:In one line: on autopilot.Maybe it is just us, but the pace and tone of Mr Draghi’s introductory statement suggests that he and the governing council have already cast their mind on the upcoming Summer holiday. In short, we got no new significant new information from the ECB today.Perhaps the most interesting bit from the press conference was Mr. Draghi’s comments that the trajectory of bank equities are “important” for the central bank because a persistent and strong decline implies a higher cost of capital and lower lending growth. Mr. Draghi also appeared to support the need for a public backstop for banks in “exceptional circumstances.” We doubt that the ECB is planning to add bank equities to QE, but this is a comment that will undoubtedly be revisited by journalists if Eurozone bank equities suffer further.Vacations are clearly becoming a theme, and Carsten Brzeski at ING thinks the lack of action could last past summer:All ECB watchers who had booked a July vacation had clearly taken a wise decision: today’s ECB meeting did not deliver any new insights on the future path of the ECB’s monetary policy. ECB President Draghi kept all options for more monetary action open; nothing more and nothing less.All in all, today’s meeting was one that will quickly disappear from memories. More action in September is possible but not yet a given. It also was a meeting which might have brought back the desire for a relic from the past: a summer ECB meeting without a press briefing.Neil Mellor at BNY Mellon thinks Mr Draghi is getting tired of the lack of action from eurozone governments:In short, Mr Draghi painted a picture of a recovery that is perhaps faring as well as might be hoped, all things considered and that the Bank, like many of its counterparts, will be in a better position to judge matters once the Brexit dust has fully settled.Clearly, however, Mr Draghi believes more could be done from regional government. Draghi has on numerous occasions stressed that monetary policy buys time not sustainable recovery.The ECB is willing to do what it takes to ensure economic and financial stability; the sub-text is that the Bank has for some time patiently waited for Euro-zone government to take the baton of responsibility from it, seemingly to no avail.Ian Kernohan at Royal London Asset Management expects more quantitative easing news in September, when the ECB releases its latest set of forecasts for growth and inflation:While we think Brexit uncertainty is mainly an issue for the UK economy, there is also bound to be some knock-on impact on the Eurozone. With post-Brexit evidence still patchy, we think the ECB will wait until the September meeting before extending its QE timetable.Inflation remains far below the ECB’s target of 2% and while headline inflation will rise later in the year, thanks to the fading impact of a lower oil price, underlying inflationary pressures still remain very low. Delaying until September will allow an assessment of any Brexit impact to be outlined in the new ECB staff forecastsTim Graf at State Street was surprised by Mr Draghi’s unsually upbeat outlook in his first major comments following the UK’s vote to leave the EU (even if he hides it well):As we expected, the ECB held to their current set of policies. We were a bit surprised by the relatively upbeat take on current events and their impact on inflation and inflation expectations. While we think they will stand pat on major innovations for now, as previously announced programmes unfold, we suspect the need to ease may emerge later this yearAberdeen Asset Management’s Luke Hickmore said the ECB didn’t have much choice but to hold steady in July as economic data on the impact of the referendum have yet to trickle in:This month is all about central banks sitting on their hands and the ECB is no exception. They are waiting for some hard economic data to indicate what harm the UK’s referendum might have on Eurozone growth. The trouble is that there’s not much more that they can do and it wouldn’t make a huge amount of difference if they did it.It will take some tough political moves to increase the purchase programme and ease policy further.In stressing policymakers’ data dependence, Mr Draghi is in concert with Bank of England policymakers Martin Weale and Kristin Forbes, notes Neil Mellor at BNY Mellon:Mr Draghi painted a picture of a recovery that is perhaps faring as well as might be hoped, all things considered and that the Bank, like many of its counterparts, will be in a better position to judge matters once the Brexit dust has fully settled."
59;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-07-11T12:42:32Z;Pound gives up gains and slips into red;;The pound racked up some hefty gains as some of the uncertainty plaguing British politics of late dissipated with the conclusion of the Conservative leadership race. But those gains disappeared almost as quickly as they came.The pound is now down slightly on the day, having fallen as much as 0.8 per cent in the morning, before rising as much as 0.2 per cent against the dollar after Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race to lead the Conservative party.At pixel time, sterling is 0.2 per cent lower against the greenback at $1.2920.Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon writes:The decision by Andrea Leadsom to withdraw from the race this morning seems likely to remove one significant political uncertainty.It is worth noting however that other factors may well weigh on sterling from here. Firstly, today’s announcement is unlikely to materially alter the outcome of this week’s meeting of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee. It is therefore worth recalling BoE Governor Mark Carney’s comment of June 30 that “The economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer.”The second factor to note is that resolving the leadership race for the Conservative party does not entirely remove the political uncertainty. Some speculation has emerged that Theresa May and her new government (when it is finally chosen) may decide to call a general election in order to cement her mandateIn other words, sterling isn’t entirely out of the woods just yet.Chart courtesy of Bloomberg

61;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-06-29T13:37:24Z;Dead cat bounce lifts sterling up to $1.35;;"The pound’s pick-up from multi-decade lows continues.Sterling just hit $1.35 against the dollar, still a level more typical of the 2009 financial crisis, but a handy pick-up from the 31-year low it reached in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU.It’s not that the newsflow has become more positive; if anything, the opposite is true, with still no clear path forward for negotiations with the country’s former European partners.But the drop on Friday was truly off the charts. Unprecedented. And big moves always lead to a spot of profit taking.As Kit Juckes at SocGen said yesterday:Sterling can bounce to $1.35 for example, but the UK has no government and no plan for the future.Are the currency’s woes over? Be lucky.Rabobank is certainly not convinced:Despite the optimism in the market, the bleak reality is that the UK has a political system led by a lame duck PM and undermined by a split governing party and a dysfunctional opposition. The economy which last year boasted one of the best growth rates in the G7 is currently faced with the risk of recession. Amid this backdrop there is plenty of scope for the current round of short covering in the pound to dissolve rapidly. We are maintaining the view that sterling could drop sharply in the weeks ahead. Our 3 mth forecast is $1.24.And as Grant Lewis at Daiwa said earlier today:Yesterday was a better day for markets, with some sense of calm restored for now at least. But this was perhaps not surprising given the violence of the moves in the previous two trading days. And it would fit with the pattern seen in previous crises.Mr Lewis points to sterling’s performance after the currency’s ejection from the ERM. (Here’s his chart.)He says:After the initial fall it staged a not insignificant rally. But that didn’t last and the trough (which was around 30 cents lower than where the initial rally occurred) was not reached until five months later. Certainly, uncertainty over the UK’s future looks set to be more persistent this time than the turmoil seen in the immediate aftermath of the ERM debacle, while the economy seems bound to slip into recession over coming months, with corresponding downside risks for UK assets.Read more: Will the blow to sterling boost UK exports?BNY Mellon on the lessons from past crises(Top chart: Bloomberg.)"
62;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-06-24T02:29:29Z;New lows for sterling under $1.39;;"So far, the vote count night has been punctuated by bursts of frantic sterling selling and then short spells of stability. We’re back in another break lower.At pixel time, we’re at $1.3821, having traded as high as over $1.50 earlier. (Yes, you read that correctly.) It’s down by over 7 per cent so far today, and we’re several hours away from normal European trading.The reason:(You can track the results as we get them here.)Bilal Hafeez at Nomura writes:With the results so far moving more towards exit than expected, markets have reacted accordingly. The pound is down 6% since polling closed at 10pm (UK). Other big losers have been the South African rand, the Mexican peso and the Polish zloty. At the other end, the yen has rallied by close to 3%. Poor liquidity is causing “gappy” moves, so the “true” market price is difficult to determine.Says Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon:While sterling might be trading at competitive levels relative to historic norms this may end up mattering for nothing.We need to ask whether any official action might be taken to support UK markets. Firstly, we need to remember that the minutes of the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee ending on June 15 emphasised that the referendum was the largest immediate risk facing British financial markets. They added that “through financial market and confidence channels, there are also risks of adverse spill-overs to the global economy.”
That certainly suggests they would wish to take action of some form if they became sufficiently concerned about spill-over.Secondly, we need to remember what Chancellor George Osborne had to say on LBC radio earlier this week. When asked “If the financial markets do plummet on Friday would you have to consider suspending trading on the FTSE?” he replied: “Well look, the Bank of England and the Treasury – Governor Carney and myself – we have of course discussed contingency plans. But the sensible thing is to keep those secret and make sure you are well prepared for whatever happens but if you set them all out in advance then you rather undermine the power of those plans.” When asked again about the contingency plans, he replied: “I have a responsibility to the people listening to this programme to do all I can to protect them.More generally, there seems a good chance that other G7 members will be prepared to take actionFinally, and possibly most importantly, it is worth asking what this means for the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed in the near future. While a July move already seemed unlikely, it is entirely possible (given the recent comments about international concerns) that a September shift starts to look a little more remote as well."
63;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-06-24T00:26:43Z;Sterling’s hurling: Today’s huge FX move in context;;Polls from Sunderland showing voters favoured leaving the European Union prompted some huge moves in currency markets, with the British pound experiencing one of its biggest intraday swings on record.Those poll results saw sterling drop as much as 3.9 per cent against the US dollar to a session low of $1.4295, writes Peter Wells. Previously, it had been as much as 1 per cent higher at $1.5018, the first time above $1.50 since December 17.That equates to an intraday range of 4.9 per cent, trailing only October 24 2008 and Black Wednesday in 1992, according to FT analysis of intraday Bloomberg data going back to 1989.Overnight volatility in the pound rose to a record high as polls opened on Thursday.Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon says a narrow Leave victory could prove “a record-breaker” for sterling, adding:Beyond sterling, we need to start thinking about how nations such as Switzerland and Japan will react should save haven flows begin to head their way.
64;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-06-02T17:45:55Z;Federal Reserve to toughen stress tests for big US banks;Daniel Tarullo says capital surcharges will be incorporated into annual examinations;Federal Reserve officials have confirmed plans to toughen the annual round of stress tests for the biggest, most complex banks, while extending relief to smaller lenders with less than $250bn in assets.Daniel Tarullo, the Fed’s lead banking supervisor, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday that the eight banks deemed to be “global systemically important financial institutions”, will be required to incorporate capital surcharges into their minimum capital thresholds in the tests.Separately, at a banking-industry event, Fed governor Jerome Powell said the central bank’s move — which is likely to take effect in the 2018 stress tests — would make big banks “fully internalise the risk” they pose to the economy. According to Mr Powell, the point is to raise capital requirements to a level at which banks consider selling assets and relying less on wholesale funding.The eight Sifis — which face capital surcharges ranging from 1 per cent to 3.5 per cent of their total risk-weighted assets — are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street.These banks will see a “significant increase” in capital levels once the surcharges are fed into the stress-testing process, Mr Tarullo said. “We need to have those …institutions more resilient than other banks in the economy.”Since the introduction of the stress tests — known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis & Review — as an annual ritual in 2011, it has become Washington’s preferred way of keeping the biggest banks on a tight leash. The Fed is anxious not to see a repeat of 2008, when banks brought the financial system to the brink of collapse and dozens of institutions had to be bailed out by taxpayers.Banks taking the test have grown more comfortable with the process in recent years, increasing requests to return capital by about 50 per cent, as a proportion of their stressed capital, between 2013 and 2015. Fitch, the rating agency, expects that ratio to rise again in the 2016 test, pushing closer to a 30 per cent dividend payout threshold that the Fed has said will receive closer scrutiny.But by layering on extra capital requirements for the biggest banks, the Fed will check those ambitions and prompt banks to reduce their footprints further. JPMorgan announced in January that it had shrunk its balance sheet by about $220bn in 2015 by cutting customer deposits and reducing its use of derivatives.The surcharges, which go beyond international minimums set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are to be phased in to the end of 2018. The Fed had previously indicated that it planned to apply the surcharges, but had not set out a timetable.Mr Tarullo also said that banks with less than $250bn in assets will no longer be subject to the full, two-part CCAR. Rather than undergo a qualitative assessment of their grip over the risks they face, the midsized banks would instead just take the quantitative test, which measures whether they have enough capital to withstand a severe shock to the system.The change, effective for the 2017 CCAR, could affect about 23 of the 33 banks taking this year’s two-part test.“This feature of the CCAR has posed a particular challenge for some of the regional banks,” Mr Tarullo said. “We can achieve what we need on risk management and capital planning with those regional banks in the normal supervisory programme that we have over the course of the year.”Greg Carmichael, chief executive of Fifth Third Bancorp, a $121bn-in-assets bank based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said he welcomed the exemption, noting that the bank’s CCAR submission had grown from 2,000 pages in 2011 to 19,000 pages last year.“It’s one less concern,” he said. “It takes some risk off the table, in respect of getting approval for our [capital-return] plan.”

Mr Worah, chief investment officer for asset allocation and real return at Pimco, is due to take his place on the committee once he is confirmed by the US Treasury. Mr Rodosky’s name has been removed from the list of TBAC members published online, report Joe Rennison and Mary Childs in New York.The TBAC is an important point of interaction between the US Treasury and the financial industry. Mr Worah’s appointment extends Pimco’s long-held relationship with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.In the fall of 2008, Pimco, which oversees $1.5tn, was among institutions tapped by the New York Fed to buy mortgage bonds to help damp interest rates, and helped the US government evaluate the soundness of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America before their shotgun wedding.When Alan Greenspan retired after 18 years as the Fed chairman, he joined Pimco as a consultant, and in 2015, his successor Ben Bernanke followed suit.A number of other changes to the TBAC have also taken place in recent months. Isaac Chang stepped down from his post when he left KCG recently, where he was global head of fixed income. Curtis Arledge left BNY Mellon in February and has subsequently stepped down from TBAC.

69;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;New Federal Reserve push to limit fallout from bank failures;Central bank proposes pause in unwinding of derivatives contracts at foundering institutions;"The Federal Reserve is proposing new measures to prevent a chaotic bank collapse by asking institutions that trade with a failing lender to pause before demanding their money back. In an effort to prevent a re-run of Lehman Brothers’ collapse in 2008, the Fed unveiled a proposal for lenders to stop counterparties from immediately exercising certain contractual rights when a bank goes into bankruptcy. The move on Tuesday marks the US’s latest effort to end “too big to fail” lenders by finding ways to handle a bank collapse without jeopardising financial stability or requiring a taxpayer-funded bailout. The proposal would require the rewriting of contracts so that counterparties such as fund managers waive their right to terminate contracts, and thus claim payments, for a period of up to 48 hours when a bank enters bankruptcy.Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, said it would help manage the risks around a big bank’s collapse by allowing time to transfer certain contracts — notably derivatives, repo and securities lending transactions — from a failed institution to a solvent one. “When these contracts . . . unravel all at once at a failed, large banking organisation; an orderly resolution of the bank may become far more difficult, sparking asset fire sales that may consume many firms,” she said at a Fed public meeting to discuss the rule on Tuesday. The move would have implications for asset managers, hedge funds and insurance companies that do business regularly with banks through contracts known as qualified financial contracts, or QFCs.Don Hawthorne, a partner at law firm Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider, said that the proposal could be counter-productive. “Holding the show up” for 48 hours “may not seem a major burden for creditors, but in reality, your options change dramatically based on what happens in that period,” he said.“If institutional investors do not have that flexibility, when they see a bank that is not insolvent but looking vulnerable, they may start to terminate positions and move their business elsewhere — which will cause the very problems regulators are trying to remedy.”If institutional investors do not have that flexibility, when they see a bank that is not insolvent but looking vulnerable, they may start to terminate positions and move their business elsewhereLehman’s collapse triggered bedlam that tipped the world into recession as market players scrambled to figure out how the fallen bank’s financial exposures would be unwound. The requirement to alter contracts would apply to eight US banks tagged as institutions that have the potential to cause systemic disruption: Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo. The proposal would only suspend, not eliminate, some of their counterparties’ rights. Federal Reserve officials said they were not being asked to do business with big banks on terms they found unacceptable and could choose to transact elsewhere.The Fed’s proposal is largely consistent with a voluntary protocol introduced in 2014 by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade group."
70;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-04-27T10:15:27Z;Tradition to launch collateral trading;Swiss interdealer broker sets sights on European repo market;"Tradition, the Swiss interdealer broker, is to launch a new collateral trading platform from next month that aims to shore up Europe’s misfiring repo market.The new venue, called Elixium, will replace planned venue DBV-X, which is set to move to BNY Mellon, the US custodian bank. It will be run by Nick McCall, a long-serving fixed income trader at Tradition, and will start with what the company calls a “soft rollout”.The venue is aiming to fill a gap in the repo, or repurchase, market left by retreating banks. The market is for short-term financing, in which asset managers and pension funds lend out assets like government bonds for 48 hours to brokers. It is the main place to source and mobilise collateral, also acting to link securities and derivatives markets.The market has contracted by more than a fifth in Europe since the financial crisis as regulation and persistent low interest rates have made it unprofitable for some banks. That has raised fears that a key financial market can no longer function normally, as broker dealers may not be able to fund long positions or cover short sales.However, others have questioned whether the market is suited to electronic trading. A report by the International Capital Markets Association, a trade body, last week said many in the market still liked the “colour, experience and discretion” an interbank electronic order book could not provide.Investors will be able to raise cash on Elixium against collateral or provide it for investors that need it, against euro, sterling or US dollars via a periodic fixed auction similar to an order book run by an exchange. It will be marketed to corporate treasurers, clearing houses, asset managers, banks and hedge funds.The move will also represent an effort to differentiate itself from larger rivals BGC Partners, which bought GFI last year, and Tullett Prebon and ICAP, whose broking arms are merging.“Elixium will build upon and augment our successful voice and electronic trading offerings and that, going forward, will be an integral arm to our developing business model,” said Dan Marcus, global head of strategy and business development at Tradition.The venue will be owned by Tradition and run in the UK as a “multilateral trading facility”, a European legal designation for lightly-regulated markets.It will initially begin trading standardised baskets of sterling-denominated maturities but it plans to trade more than 40 collateral baskets covering fixed income and equities in euros, US and Canadian dollars, yen and some emerging market currencies.It has also hired Roberto Verrillo, the former Nomura sterling rates trader, as head of strategy and markets; Gabrielli Frediani will become chief business development officer; Nick Van Overstraeten, former director of fixed income at Citi, joins as director of product development; while Iona Levine, the former LCH Clearing general counsel, will be its special adviser.Euroclear, the Belgian-based settlement house, is expected to be one of the tri-party repo agents for the service."
71;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-04-26T17:21:52Z;Bank of New York Mellon in talks over DBV-X deal;US bank plans to move into repo trading by taking over start-up trading venue from Tradition;Bank of New York Mellon is planning to move into repurchase trading in Europe with the purchase of start-up trading venue DBV-X, formerly of Tradition, the Swiss interdealer broker.The US bank is in talks to take over the venue, which was founded by former RBS and Newedge clearing executive John Wilson. Despite an extensive roadshow to attract investors, DBV-X did not launch last year as planned after it failed to reach commercial terms with Tradition.“BNY Mellon . . . confirms that it is currently conducting due diligence and in talks with DBV-X,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.BNY Mellon’s move extends its reach into the repo market, where institutions like banks temporarily borrow cash from investors in exchange for pledging bonds as collateral.The US bank is already one of the world’s largest custodian banks providing intermediaries with temporary credit and collateral, to help them roll over loans. DBV-X plans to launch a centralised venue for market participants to exchange collateral, a radical departure for market that has historically been conducted directly between banks.It also highlights how the market, typically dominated by investment banks, is being fractured and recast by new banking and markets rules.Banks are required to hold more capital on their balance sheets to cover their market trades, making the cost of trading less profitable. The repo market in Europe has declined by a fifth since the height of the financial crisis.At the same time investors and banks must find more margin, which protects against defaults, to back their over-the-counter derivatives trades.DBV-X aims to match treasurers and asset managers sitting on billions of high-quality assets with investors like hedge funds and pension funds in need of short-term funds. It confirmed on Tuesday it was separating from Tradition with immediate effect. “Both parties acknowledge the assistance provided to each other during their period of collaboration,” it said in a statement.However there are doubts whether the repo market will embrace more electronic trading, where deals are executed over a centralised order book akin to an exchange.A report last week by the International Capital Markets Association highlighted a trend of younger and more inexperienced employees replacing older staff across fixed income trading. The repo market was the only possible exception, ICMA said, as “older experienced traders are still seen as adding value, and providing something that the interbank order book cannot: knowledge, flow, colour, experience and discretion.”

The increase meant that BNY’s net interest margin improved by 4 basis points to 1.01 per cent, while in the US it started to reimpose some of the management fees it had been forced to waive on its money-market funds.Revenues came to $3.72bn, down 2 per cent from a year earlier, but expenses dropped 3 per cent, helping to push net income up 5 per cent for the period to $804m. Earnings per share were 75 cents, better than expectations of 68 cents. The shares rose 2 per cent to $40.50 in late morning trade.Expenses will remain in focus, said Todd Gibbons, chief financial officer, citing further reductions in real estate costs and travel costs, due to greater use of videoconferencing.“It was nice to see [the rate increase] come, but we can’t control it,” he said, adding that he was “no longer in the game of betting on the direction” of central banks around the world. “We have to operate with the environment we’ve got.”The comments were in tune with other senior executives during the US bank earnings season, in which many have stressed their determination to cut costs in the face of volatile markets, sluggish growth in core markets and spillover effects from rising bankruptcies in the energy sector.All those forces suggest that the Fed may be reluctant to push up rates any further, having finally achieved “lift-off” four months ago.BNY's efforts to trim expenses showed “very good progress” in the period, said Ken Usdin, analyst at Jefferies in New York.But some analysts say the bank needs to do more to cut its bloated global workforce of 52,100. One of them, Mike Mayo of CLSA, used the opportunity of last week’s annual meeting of shareholders to challenge Ed Garden, who has represented Mr Peltz’s Trian on BNY’s board for just over a year.Mr Garden — the son-in-law of Mr Peltz — said that he was confident that the bank was building a more durable business. Trian held about 3 per cent of BNY’s stock as of February.“Do we have more work to do? Absolutely,” he said. “The board holds management accountable and is not interested in mediocrity.”The results came a day after the US Department of Treasury had decided to feature Civil War-era abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, and abandoned a plan to remove Alexander Hamilton, founder of The Bank of New York 232 years ago, from the $10 bill.Treasury secretary Jack Lew said the about-face came in response to an unexpected backlash over the removal of Mr Hamilton after the plan was announced last June — a response fuelled, in part, by the popularity of the Broadway musical based on the life of the Founding Father.On a call with analysts on Thursday, chairman and chief executive Gerald Hassell said he was “very, very pleased” with the outcome.

Shareholders have moved on;It has been so long since the financial crisis that Citigroup has emerged as a model institution. Perhaps the distinction is just a modest one, however. On Wednesday morning the US Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released their review of the 2015 “resolution” plans submitted by the US banks. Popularly referred to as living wills, the plans explain how banks would unwind themselves when approaching a bankruptcy without destabilising the broader financial system (see: Lehman Brothers circa 2008).The regulators’ verdict matters — the ultimate sanction for a weak plan is a break-up. The original submissions of every financial institution came up short. This time, the collective results were somewhat better, with Citi leading the pack. Five other banks received notice of deficiencies from both agencies: Bank of America, BNY Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, State Street and Wells Fargo. This group has until October to improve in areas such as liquidity, corporate governance, operations and legal organisation. The Fed and FDIC could not agree on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.Awkwardly enough, JPMorgan’s first-quarter earnings were released almost simultaneously with the living will feedback. The bank acknowledged the results and vowed to make amends. But it quickly moved on to earnings, which were better than expected. Its shares, along with the broader sector, rallied a few percentage points, demonstrating how little shareholders were worried about either financial distress or the government’s willingness to break up recalcitrant banks.Shareholders care more about current performance and the potential for bigger buybacks, which will be governed by the results of Fed stress tests, due in June. Citi trades at just 0.7 times its tangible book value, worse than peers. That it outperforms in the afterlife is cold comfort.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
74;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Regulators reject ‘living wills’ of 5 big US banks;;"Five big US banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America failed to deliver adequate “living wills” to show how they could be wound up in a future crisis, said regulators who ordered the institutions to improve or face harsh sanctions.The living wills – a key part of post-crisis financial reforms – are intended to prevent more taxpayer bailouts of big institutions and the kind of chaos sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, reports Barney Jopson in Washington.In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of America, the US’s top banking regulators said on Wednesday that Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street had also delivered plans that were “not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution” in a crisis.The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ordered the banks to remediate their deficiencies by October 1, 2016, or face more stringent regulations, including higher capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, and restrictions on growth and operations.Tom Hoenig, vice chairman of the FDIC, said:[Each] plan has shortcomings or deficiencies, although … some firms have made more progress than others. Most importantly, no firm yet shows itself capable of being resolved in an orderly fashion through bankruptcy.Thus, the goal to end too big to fail and protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts remains just that: only a goal.A senior regulator said the five banks should be capable of remediating their deficiencies by the October deadline, but added that doing so would involve some difficult choices.The critical judgments marked the second time the banks’ living wills had fallen short in the eyes of the Federal Reserve or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, although last time, in 2014, the regulators did not agree on the severity of the shortcomings.On Wednesday the FDIC also determined that Goldman Sachs’ plan was not credible, but the Federal Reserve did not concur. The Federal Reserve found that Morgan Stanley’s plan was deficient, but the FDIC did not agree.Although both regulators found deficiencies in Citigroup’s living will, they did not conclude that it was “not credible”.Weaknesses in the living wills varied by bank, but included: how a bank determines when to enter bankruptcy; how its resolution strategy aligns with bankruptcy procedures; whether it has adequate liquidity; and how it would pass capital to operating units ahead of bankruptcy.“Having answers to these issues for each [systemically important bank] is critical to successfully move one through bankruptcy,” said Mr Hoenig.Banks have previously said that they have simplified their operations and made other changes to make it easier to “resolve” themselves in a crisis.On Tuesday a government watchdog urged regulators to be more transparent about how they decide whether to accept a bank’s living will, arguing that opacity may “may weaken public and market confidence” in the plans.That echoed a complaint of banks, which say they are not told enough about regulators’ decision-making."

It may be worth brushing up now that authorities are growing more frustrated with the rise in the currency, and may be considering bashing it back down.The upward pressure on the yen against the dollar is relentless today. The dollar is down by some 1.6 per cent, leaving it just under Y108.Market participants are wondering when the Japanese authorities will run out of patience. When will the Ministry of Finance instruct the Bank of Japan to buy dollars and stop the rot? (On which, more in this podcast.) Time to track Yen Speak for clues.Today, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said the government is “watching FX markets with vigilance”.Simon Derrick, an analyst at BNY Mellon reckons the phrase to watch is “one-sided.” He points out in a note that:Ahead of intervention on September 15, 2010Ahead of intervention on August 4, 2011And in the past 24 hours:Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga informed a news conference that “Excessive volatility and disorderly currency moves would have a bad impact (on the economy)”. Suga then described recent yen moves as “one-sided.”An unnamed senior finance ministry official told Reuters “[the yen's recent moves have] been one-sided … We will take steps (in the market) if necessary.”“It is clear that the use of the phrase ‘one-sided’ has been an accurate indicator of the MoF’s willingness to authorise intervention by the BoJ if necessary,” says Mr Derrick. “This therefore just leaves the question of what tactics they might use.”Not everyone is so convinced that the BoJ is limbering up. As Commerzbank wrote earlier:He [Prime minister Shinzo Abe] is the host of the next G7 summit which will be held on 26th and 27th May in Ise-Shima…No doubt Abe does not want to get into trouble at the G7 summit for the BoJ focusing too much on the yen so as to ensure that its monetary policy retains some effectiveness… Once the visitors have left he or Central Bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda can refer to “disorderly movements“ and “excessive volatility“ on the FX markets to their hearts’ content.

The bank’s consumer operation has been in retreat as it seeks to recover from the financial crisis, exiting more than a dozen countries since chief executive Michael Corbat took charge in 2012.The bank is expanding into custody while the highly competitive business comes under pressure: low interest rates are eroding income from investments, while several custody banks are cost cutting to shore up earnings.But Citi argues it is better positioned than rivals to compete for global mandates — Six Securities Services already uses Citi in 14 other markets — and is well positioned for the long term.Two years ago the bank secured a $865bn custody deal with the Norwegian oil fund, winning the business from JP Morgan.Citi has integrated its custody business more closely with its investment bank to reduce expenses and cross-sell products.In the autumn Citi hired Dominic Crowe from the Bank of New York Mellon and Bill Pryor from JP Morgan as senior custody and fund services managers.

78;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-03-13T23:01:43Z;Jyoti Chopra, global head of diversity and inclusion, BNY Mellon;Do not be afraid to face tough situations, says BNY Mellon’s head of diversity;Jyoti Chopra was born and raised in north London with her two younger sisters. Her family were first-generation Indian immigrants and both her parents worked — her mother was an early role model as she continued to work as an interpreter until her early seventies.Ms Chopra moved to the US to attend New York University, where she earned a social sciences degree. She later completed an executive education programme at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and is currently doing an Executive MBA at Saïd Business School, Oxford.Her previous experience includes the United Nations, Merrill Lynch and Deloitte. The UN, in particular, was a transformational experience, dealing with war, disasters and emergency relief operations.Ms Chopra divides her time between Manhattan, New York and Princeton, New Jersey, where she raised her son, Kabir. She enjoys travelling, playing tennis, swimming and Zumba classes. To relax she likes to watch Bollywood movies.Who are your business influences?The chairman and chief executive of BNY Mellon, Gerald Hassell, since he’s a more than 40-year veteran of the firm. Karen Peetz, the bank’s president, as she is currently the only female president of a major Wall Street firm and leads several businesses and major client areas. And James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Through these people I stay abreast of economics.Why did you choose Saïd Business School, University of Oxford?The key was to follow a programme for developing and refining business, technical and operational management skills. The Oxford EMBA programme covered aspects that aligned with my career ambitions: such as decision-making in a highly complex, regulated global market and learning how to conduct business in emerging markets.What do you enjoy most about your job?Being a part of business that is driving change and cultural transformation through its people. Serving as an advocate for gender parity and diversity, and demonstrating the business case for inclusion is compelling and unique. There is no other job like it. Each day is different and each day I meet and touch the professional lives of many and that is incredibly satisfying.What do you find most difficult?I find dealing with conflict or controversy challenging at times. It is, however, a rite of passage. Bold decision-making is a key hallmark of leadership. There are times when you will have to face difficult people, overcome obstacles or deal with unexpected situations. It is essential to learn from past mistakes and not to be afraid to put yourself in tough situations.What is the biggest challenge you have ever faced and how did you overcome it?Coming to the US alone as a young woman, leaving my family in the UK, was challenging. I arrived knowing virtually no one and worked full-time to finance my university education in New York. Holding down a full-time job and studying the equivalent of a full-time course was a struggle, but an accomplishment that afforded great pride. Working in financial services on Wall Street, where there are few south Asian female role models and breaking into leadership ranks was also incredibly challenging, but important for paving the way for others.What is the best piece of advice given to you?There are several, in fact. My present manager, BNY Mellon’s chief human resources officer recently reminded me about the notion of “mind over matter” as I was tackling a particularly challenging course within the EMBA. The second is from the former global chief operating officer at Deloitte who taught me to “invest in the success of others”, which has helped to keep me grounded and focused on building up others and contributing to broader efforts beyond my immediate remit. The third is from the former global chief executive of Deloitte, who taught me that “proper planning prevents poor performance”.What is your favourite business book?Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds. The book expands on the elements of “sticky” messages such as simplicity, surprise, concreteness, credibility, emotion and story. It includes 10 graphic design principles and insights to reframe your approach to business communications. “This is a book about communication and seeing presentations in a slightly different way, a way that is in tune with our times,” he writes.Which three people, living or dead, would you invite to a business meeting?Winston Churchill, for the power of his oration, Julian Fellowes, for the power of his pen and prose and Henry Paulson, a former US Treasury secretary for leadership power and prowess, and to really understand the dynamics of crisis management and the lessons learnt from the global financial crisis.What has been your best business trip?A visit to London in April last year to attend and participate in the Oxford-Cambridge boat race. BNY Mellon has been the event’s sponsor for the past several years and organises a number of client events in conjunction with the occasion. Last year the men’s and women’s boat races were both held on the same day for the first time. It was poignant to be there, standing on the bank of the river Thames to see a powerful symbol for gender parity being realised. I was particularly thrilled to see Oxford win both races.If you could do it all again, what would you do differently?I would have reversed experiences and started in financial services, developed sector specialisation, then headed to a non-profit. What’s important are the life-long lessons you learn and how you apply them. Challenges, mistakes and failures: it is how we respond, learn, evolve and emerge from these experiences that form exceptional leaders.

80;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-02-24T07:46:00Z;"Sterling still stuck around $1.40; HSBC warns of inflation rush";;More queasiness for the Queen’s currency, and more warnings on the potential ripple effects.Sterling’s brisk descent — in lockstep with fears about the UK’s potential exit from the EU– has left it at another milestone. It’s stuck at around $1.40 for the first time since March 2009, having dipped even below that point in Asian trading hours, write Michael Hunter and Katie Martin.The low for the day so far is $1.3961. Since the highest point of this month, it is some 4.4 per cent weaker.Says HSBC:Our central case in the event of a vote for Brexit is that uncertainty grips the economy. This could take around 1.0-1.5 percentage points off the GDP growth rate by the second half of 2017. This would push our 2017 growth forecast, currently 2.3%, into the 0.8-1.3% range. And if sterling were to fall by around 15-20% (as our currency strategists predict), UK inflation could rise by up to 5 percentage points (our end-2017 inflation forecast is 1.8%). In the event of a vote for Brexit, concerns about deflation could swiftly give way to worries of stagflation.(And yes, if you’re wondering, that’s a further 15-20 per cent drop in sterling.) The bank suggests that even interest rate rises could not prevent the pound from swooning. See its outline of possible outcomes below.Simon Derrick, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon, has looked at the recent price action in the pound, and compared it with that seen during historic crises. His observations are below. Perhaps they are just a taste of what may lie ahead.Sterling can travel a long way in a crisis. During its collapse in 1981 and then again in both 1992 and 2008, the currency managed to lose 25% or more over a six month period. Even more minor moves (1975, 1975, 1976, 1989, 1991, 2010) saw declines in the region of 15% over a period of half a year.Our measure of volatility over the past month for sterling against the euro stands at almost exactly the same levels that it stood at on the day the UK exited the ERM and on the day the UK announced the banking bail-out in October 2008.
81;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
82;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-02-22T18:43:21Z;US bank lobbyists blast ‘excessive’ capital requirement rules;Fed’s proposals to build bigger buffer against losses could restrict credit flows;The top lobby groups for banks in the US have blasted proposals to make them build bigger buffers against losses, saying that the “excessive” requirements could restrict the flow of credit to the world’s biggest economy.The lobbyists were responding to proposals set out late last year by the US Federal Reserve, which were part of a global effort designed to end the problem of lenders whose size and influence renders them “too big to fail”.Debate continues to rage on whether policymakers have done enough to prevent a repeat of the taxpayer-funded bailouts which steadied the big banks after the financial crisis in 2008.According to the Fed’s proposed rules on banks’ “total loss absorbing capacity”, or TLAC, banks must operate with a minimum amount of equity and debt — equal to 18 per cent of risk-weighted assets — that can be written off when a bank gets into serious trouble.But in a response made jointly on Monday by the five biggest bank lobby groups, the banks said such a requirement — which would be become effective in January 2019 — would provide more than enough cover for losses arising from “any reasonably foreseeable severely adverse scenario”.In a 151-page letter, the groups urged the Fed to cut its minimum TLAC requirement to 14 per cent of RWAs, before adding on surcharges of up to 5 per cent for the biggest and most complex banks. The Fed’s proposals had been designed as an overlay to international standards agreed last September by the Basel-based Financial Stability Board, which called for TLAC ratios of at least 16 per cent for “globally systemically important banks”, or GSIBs.Reforms since the crisis mean that “the US has an extraordinarily resilient and resolvable set of large banks,” said Greg Baer, president of The Clearing House, which lobbies on behalf of the 24 biggest commercial lenders in the US. Going beyond FSB standards “is not achieving any goal of ending ‘too big to fail’ and is simply imposing greater costs on operations and ultimately, market liquidity,” he said.The co-ordinated attack by the lobby groups is a mark of the US banking industry’s frustrations with the Fed, which they say has become dominated by academics and economists who are unresponsive to arguments about the real-world effects of their rulemaking. The lobbyists argue that “gold-plating” capital standards for the biggest US banks is encouraging them to lay off activities to more lightly regulated non-banks such as hedge funds and online lenders, which might prove to be erratic sources of supply.According to the lobbyists’ calculations, the eight biggest US banks would have an aggregate TLAC shortfall of at least $363bn — about three times greater than the $120bn estimate by the Fed last October.$363bnEstimate of the aggregate ‘total loss absorbing capacity’ shortfall the eight biggest US banks would have, according to lobby groupsThe Clearing House was joined in its effort by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable and the Financial Services Forum.The eight US banks designated as GSIBs are JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Wells Fargo.In a separate letter on Monday, the Institute of International Bankers applied pressure on the Fed to soften its TLAC proposal, saying that it would “impose excessive costs” on its members while leading to “competitive disparities and unfair treatment in international banking without commensurate benefits to resolvability or US financial stability”.The IIB represents non-US banks with about $5tn in assets in their US operations.

85;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-01-21T18:22:01Z;BNY Mellon answers activists with cost-cutting;Custody bank pledge to preserve margins whatever happens to in any market orinterest rates;BNY Mellon has answered activist investor demands with another quarter of profit growth and strengthened its commitment to cutting costs to protect margins regardless of shifts in markets or interest rates.BNY, which keeps records, tracks performance and lends securities for institutional investors, has grappled over several years with the profit-sapping effects of persistently low interest rates — drawing the attention of activist funds including Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners and Marcato Capital Management, run by Richard “Mick” McGuire.But since setting out a plan to boost returns in October 2014, the bank has consistently done better than analysts’ estimates. In the fourth quarter last year BNY took a hit connected to a $312m loan to Sentinel Management Group, a Chicago-based money manager which collapsed in 2007. Adjusted for a $170m charge for probable losses, the bank delivered earnings per share of 68c, four pennies better than analysts’ forecasts.Net income for the quarter was $693m, up from $233m a year earlier. Revenues came to $3.72bn, up 1.5 per cent, narrowly missing estimates of $3.75bn.“Even with geopolitical instability, emerging market weakness, higher regulatory compliance requirements and low interest rates, we executed on our strategic priority, we focused on what was within our control,” said Gerald Hassell, chief executive, on a call with analysts. He reiterated a pledge to increase revenues faster than expenses in 2016, no matter what happens.Mr Hassell’s comments were in tune with other chief executives during the US banks’ earnings season, in which many have stressed their determination to trim expenses in the face of sliding oil prices, heavier regulatory burdens and fears over the growth outlook in China. All those forces suggest that the US Federal Reserve may be disinclined to push up interest rates further, having finally achieved “lift-off” in December.BNY’s focus on costs appears to have muted the activists. Marcato, which early last year delivered presentations accusing management of dragging its feet on expense reduction, has not issued any public statements since May. It declined to comment on Thursday.David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital, which took a position in BNY’s stock last summer, said this week that it had withdrawn at a small profit. It felt the market was “giving the company too much credit for potential earnings leverage to multiple Fed rate hikes”.Trian Partners, meanwhile, has been “a positive contributor” since taking a seat on BNY’s board just over a year ago, according to Todd Gibbons, the bank’s chief financial officer.BNY, which has assets of $28.9tn in custody or administration, is the world’s biggest investment services provider by market capitalisation, and describes itself as a “single point of contact” for clients looking to create, trade, hold, manage, service, distribute or restructure investments.Ken Usdin, analyst at Jefferies in New York, on Thursday described BNY’s fourth-quarter cost control as “strong”, surpassing his estimates across most categories.As part of the cost-cutting efforts, BNY decamped from its lower Manhattan headquarters at 1 Wall Street to a new building on Liberty Street, across the road from Goldman Sachs, saving $10m a year.The bank recently opened up a new front in its expenses programme, asking suppliers to submit to tougher efficiency standards in human resources, compliance, legal and risk. If they do not, the relationship could end.“We’ve found quite a few pockets to pore over,” Mr Gibbons said. “You tend to respond to things individually, then sometimes pull back.”

The role of business in society is clear: in addition to performing well for customers and shareholders, we can and must use our resources to help solve difficult problems. We hope this news encourages other companies around the world to follow suit and that together we can make a genuine difference.”David Searle, executive director of the Boat Race Company, said: “We had a huge number of plaudits for returning women to the tideway on equivalent terms, which was a very special moment for wider society. We thought afterwards with our creative minds how can we build on that. The Boat Race Company adopting Cancer Research UK was the spark.“We are leading the way with one of the oldest continuously contested sporting trophies.”Sir Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: “Today, two in four people survive cancer. Our ambition is to accelerate progress so that three in four people survive cancer by 2034, and this donation is a very welcome contribution to that aim.”This month Cancer Research UK launched The Great Row, an indoor fitness challenge on rowing machines.The boat race crews will meet on the choppy four miles of water between Putney and Chiswick bridges on March 27.

88;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-01-15T08:42:57Z;Hong Kong dollar still feeling the heat;;It would barely register for most other currencies, but by Hong Kong dollar standards, this week has brought an enormous decline.After a 0.25 per cent drop yesterday, the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the US dollar, is continuing to slide today. The buck is up by 0.11 per cent at pixel time at HKD7.7929. A teeny tiny decline, really, but the chart below puts it into context. This currency simply does not usually move, writes Katie Martin. At all.So what’s going on?It’s tempting to see this as yet another speculative run at a currency peg. (See also, Saudi Arabia.) There may be some of this going on, but analysts are not convinced.Says US bank BBH:We do not think it is a speculative attack. Rather, we think it reflects another leg in capital outflows from the mainland. Either way, we see the peg remaining in place for the foreseeable future.The main rationale for shifting the peg is that the Hong Kong economy is not as closely tied to the US as it once was. What this argument for delinking from the US dollar ignores, however, is the fact that the Chinese yuan is not yet freely convertible. However, we continue to believe that it is realistic scenario to expect a repegging of the HKD to the Chinese yuan at some time in the future (perhaps in 10+ years?)We can’t put it any better than the IMF did in its annual Article IV consultation from November: “The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for Hong Kong and serves as an anchor of stability for this small open economy with a globally integrated financial services industry.”BNY Mellon, a custody bank that looks after investors’ holdings, points out that that its books show “sustained outflows” by fund managers out of both Chinese and Hong Kong equity markets. (See its chart below.) The bank adds:A spike in Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates for yuan loans to record highs this week. While this surge in yuan borrowing rates has likely deterred speculators, a prolonged period of elevated rates may dent Hong Kong’s appeal as the leading offshore yuan financing/trade center.
89;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2016-01-07T09:13:27Z;Sterling hits 5-year low;;The pound has fallen to a 5-year low today, as nerves surrounding a possible British exit from the European Union weigh on sentiment and markets around the world are rocked by uncertainty over the Chinese market.Sterling has fallen 0.3 per cent against the greenback to a 5-year low of $1.4561, writes Joel Lewin.The falls comes amid a global equity sell-off and plunges in commodity prices, with many currencies taking a hammering in the Thursday trading session.As well as Brexit fears and Bank of England dovishness, the pound has also been hurt by the dollar’s rally. The greenback has been powering higher against most global currencies as the Federal Reserve embarks on its first rate raising cycle in a decade.In contrast to the Fed, the Bank of England is not expected to raise rates any time soon. Stubbornly low inflation and rough global market conditions have tied the bank’s hands.Neil Mellor at BNY Mellon said (emphasis ours):As things stand, here, at the start of 2016, the fact that UK shop prices remain subject to engrained deflation (per the BRC’s latest report), the fact that oil prices (subject to review) singularly refuse to take heed of rising tensions in the Middle East, and the fact that concerns about China’s economy – the rationale for Carney’s renewed dovishness last autumn – are unrelenting, means that UK interest rates are going nowhere fast (a view we have held for quite some time). However, as this much was assumed prior to the start of December, it is difficult to solely attribute an economic rationale to GBP’s precipitous decline in the interim, and so we must assume that it is ‘Brexit’ concerns that have come to the fore.Sterling’s recent slide brings many benefits. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight says:The pound’s weakening is very welcome news for UK exporters who have found sterling’s strength as a major handicap in recent times, and it will boost hopes that economic growth can finally become a little less dependent on domestic demand. However, the strength of global growth over the coming months will still be very important to UK exporters, especially domestic demand in the Eurozone.The Bank of England will also likely be far from unhappy with a weaker pound. A weaker pound should help to lift inflation (which is what the Bank of England wants) especially as oil and commodities are typically priced in dollars. It will also dilute Bank of England concern that any raising of interest rates could see sterling strengthen to uncomfortable highs.

91;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-12-21T18:58:15Z;KPMG UK’s year to forget: revenue falls and audit probes;Firm’s revenues fall behind EY, leaving it smallest of ‘big four’;"For KPMG in the UK, 2015 has been a year to forget.The audit, tax and advisory firm’s revenues have fallen behind rivals to make it the smallest of the “big four” firms, partner remuneration has fallen and it has faced fresh calls in parliament to be investigated over its audits of the failed bank HBOS.At KPMG UK’s annual meeting last Tuesday, chairman Simon Collins faced an outpouring of grievances from partners, according to some of those who attended.Partners voiced frustration with the professional services firm’s performance and with what some see as poor implementation of a new operating model that Mr Collins unveiled in the summer.The concern was fuelled by figures published last week showing KPMG UK had slipped behind rival EY. In the 12 months to September 30, KPMG UK’s revenues increased 2.6 per cent to £1.96bn while EY overtook it, growing 8 per cent. In addition, KPMG’s profit dropped 7 per cent to £383m.The decrease in profits, an increase in the number of partners and investment of some £200m in the UK business during 2015 combined to push average partner remuneration down 13 per cent from £715,000 to £623,000, according to reported figures.As if that were not enough, four senior partners in KPMG’s Northern Ireland office, including its chairman Jon D’Arcy, were arrested as part of a probe by HM Revenue & Customs into tax evasion. The investigation into the men from KPMG’s Belfast operation, which is part of KPMG Ireland, is continuing.KPMG UK hopes its new operating model — in the works for three years — will help improve the business. This organises the business by clients rather than products, with tax and advisory, for example, grouped together under “solutions”. While partners generally support the logic of the new model, they are frustrated with its implementation and how this has been communicated, according to several of those at the agm.“It always takes time to bed down a new operating model,” Mr Collins said in an interview. “It’s a time of change.”Change also means a shake-up of the executive committee, where positions have been cut and others — including a general counsel — have been added. The chief operating officer, Jim Marsh, has left and some of the chairman’s day-to-day responsibilities have been passed to the new managing partner, Philip Davidson, a “good move”, according to one KPMG partner.The internal reorganisation comes at a time when KPMG’s reputation is under attack externally. Last week, Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie MP highlighted KPMG’s audit of HBOS before the bank’s high-profile failure in 2008. It was a “serious mistake”, Mr Tyrie said, for the Financial Reporting Council, which regulates accounting firms, not to have investigated KPMG.The FRC said this month that it had looked into the audit work performed on loan-loss provisions in HBOS’s corporate division and had found no reasonable grounds to suspect misconduct by the auditors. Now Mr Tyrie is calling for the FRC to investigate afresh.“I do feel a bit defensive on HBOS,” says Mr Collins. “I don’t know what more we could have done or can do. It’s an eight year-old event over which we have no current control.”The pressure surrounding HBOS comes as KPMG is already being investigated by the FRC for three other audits. In June, the regulator said it was probing KPMG’s audit of the Bank of New York Mellon, two months after the world’s largest global custody bank was hit with a record UK fine for mixing its own funds with those of clients.KPMG is also being investigated by the FRC for its audit of controversial insurance company Quindell; and for its audit of the Co-operative Bank, after the Treasury committee criticised KPMG for failing to uncover a £1.5bn black hole in the Co-op’s finances, revealed after the mutual organisation tried to buy up Lloyds bank branches in 2013.Mr Collins says: “We would not be doing society any favours if we only took on easy audits. Therefore, the Quindell situations will come about. The sort of work we do will get us scrutinised and challenged.”For Mr Collins, who is now in his fourth year as UK chairman, his tenure has coincided with a period of change, with an increase in audit tendering, following the introduction of new European regulations on mandate renewal, and an expansion of KPMG’s advisory business, largely through acquisitions.The firm has picked up high-profile audit mandates recently, including Barclays, Experian and British American Tobacco, and this month won a multimillion pound contract from the government to train 400,000 civil servants. Nor have its rivals been immune from their own issues. For example PwC, the largest of the “big four” by UK revenues, in October settled a long-running negligence battle with subprime lender Cattles over allegations of shoddy auditing.Against this backdrop of change and challenges, Mr Collins must ensure he brings the partners along with him. “You don’t know what a partnership means until it rebels. Then you know it exists,” says one KPMG partner. “It’s not a straightforward time for us.”Mr Collins says: “It’s a tough environment out there. I don’t expect the challenge to lessen. It’s a sobering thought that you sit on a legacy of many actions that can pop up 10 years later. The view the regulators take can often change in that period.”"
92;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-12-18T15:46:15Z;A key interest rate is rising after Fed move;;Almost 48 hours after Federal Reserve policymakers announced a rise in the central bank’s key interest rate, there is further evidence that the market is responding.Another important interest rate has risen as officials at the Fed had hoped, according to data published on Friday.The central bank has had to turn to new tools to actually affect policy after lifting its target for the Fed funds rate by a quarter percentage point to between 0.25 per cent and 0.5 per cent on Wednesday.One of the the tools is its reverse repurchase program (RRP), in which the Fed borrows cash overnight, largely from money market funds in return for Treasuries, and pays a fixed rate of 0.25 per cent. In theory, banks competing for investors’ money should be forced to lift the rate they offer on similar repo transactions.The BNY Mellon tri-party repo rate, which includes all trades done under the Fed’s RRP, as well as transactions between banks and investors, rose from 0.124 basis points on Wednesday to 0.266 basis points on Thursday, according to the new data.Excluding the $105bn of RRP trades completed on Thursday, which are all done at 0.25 per cent, shows an indicative rate of 0.275 basis points for trades between banks and investors as central banker would have hoped for.The BNY Mellon tri-party repo rate gets its name because it represents all transactions to which BNY Mellon acts as intermediary.
93;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-12-15T12:27:25Z;Charts of the year: January 15th, Swiss franc. Enough said;;Where were you on the morning of January 15th 2015? No, you’re not in trouble with the police, but if you work anywhere near financial markets, you are sure to know the answer.That, of course, was the day the Swiss National Bank pulled the rug from under markets by scrapping the lower limit on the euro’s exchange rate with the franc. Mention it to a currencies trader, and watch the blood drain from their face, and the thousand-yard stare kick in. (The chart above comes courtesy of Bloomberg.)Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon brings it up as his chart of the year. He says:The key to getting to grips with what happened back in January when the SNB decided to abandon its ceiling for the Swiss franc against the Euro is to remember that it was hardly the first time that an announcement of this kind had hit the markets over the past 40 years or so. This was certainly not the first time the SNB had abandoned an exchange rate policy that effectively pegged the Franc against a major European neighbour.In 1982 the Bank abandoned its target range for the Swiss franc/Deutsche mark exchange rate reckoning that the inflationary impact was simply too great a cost to bear. Neither was it the first time a central bank had abandoned a currency policy that it claimed it was firmly committed to, as veterans of the European currency crises of the 1980s and 1990s will easily recall. It wasn’t even the first time that a central bank had abandoned its currency policy in the middle of the trading week given this is exactly what the Bank of England did back in 1992 (albeit at the end of the trading day). What mattered therefore when judging why the move in January mattered (beyond the direct and indirect damage done) was its sheer scale when compared to how markets behaved in times past.Importantly, this was not the only event this year to generate astonishing volatility in the currency markets. A press conference by the chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen back in March managed to generate the fifth highest reading in overnight volatility for the US dollar index since the Plaza Accord back in 1985 while market disappointment with the European Central Bank’s policy decision earlier this month saw the Euro rise by somewhere in the region of 4% against the US Dollar in the space of several hours. In contrast, geopolitics and terrorism have created barely a ripple in the currency markets.This, then, is a world where monetary policy is all that seems to matter. If central bankers globally are worried that the policies they are following are creating an inherently unstable environment then they need look no further than the currency markets this year and, in particular, the move seen in the Swiss franc in January.Want to share your chart of the year?

95;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-12-09T20:36:11Z;Slow, steady rate hikes should reward US stocks;;If history is any guide, the Federal Reserve’s tightening plans next year shouldn’t kill the stock market. But it all depends on the pace of rate hikes. The Bank of New York Mellon has analysed the performance of the S&P 500 in all tightening cycles going back to 1946. It found that, on average, the US benchmark has returned 3 per cent one year after the first rate lift. When the Fed has exercised patience, raising rates slowly, the average return has been 11 per cent.“The data clearly show that the pace of the rate hikes, not the ultimate start date, influences the future return of the equity market,” said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.The data largely confirms the slow, gradualist plans for the coming tightening cycle, according the Fed’s “dot plot” forecasts.But this wasn’t always the consensus. In 2004, before Ben Bernanke took the chief role at the Fed, he advocated a “cold-turkey” or “bang bang” approach to tightening monetary policy (our emphasis):Under a cold turkey strategy, at each policy meeting the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would make its best guess about where it ultimately wants the funds rate to be and would move to that rate in a single step. In the abstract, the cold turkey approach is not without appeal: If you think you know where you want to end up (or are at least are willing to make your best guess), why not just go there directly in one step rather than drawing out the process?When Mr Bernanke became chairman in 2006, he responded to the financial crisis in this vein, cutting rates on eight occasions in 2008, including three 75bps cuts as well as surprise moves at unscheduled meetings.The BNY Mellon data, not surprisingly, suggests that if the Fed adopted a trigger happy approach and lifted rates quickly next year, stocks would fall. On average, the S&P 500 loses about 3 per cent within a year when the Fed lifts rates quickly.“An aggressive Fed has a history of ending equity bull markets, and while the impending tightening cycle may end that way eventually, we believe that scenario may be years away,” Mr Mortimer said. “With the low-inflationary environment expected to continue, the Fed can be deliberate and patient in the frequency and magnitude of their rate hikes, allowing markets to adjust along the way.”

97;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;S&P downgrades raft of US banks;Rating agency says likelihood of federal government support in a future crisis has dimmed;Eight of the biggest US banks have been downgraded by Standard & Poor’s, as the credit rating agency judged that the likelihood of federal government support in a future crisis had dimmed.Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were among the banks affected by the downgrade, taken as the Federal Reserve sought to finalise rules next year governing the amounts and type of capital banks must hold to withstand a huge shock to the system.Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street — the other four groups designated as globally systemically important banks, or GSIBs — were also downgraded, a shift signalled by S&P last month. All eight holding companies have been docked one notch, while the operating companies are unaffected.In October the Fed projected that the six largest banks faced a $120bn capital shortfall under new rules that would require the institutions to hold big buffers of debt that could be converted into equity in a crisis. Banks are expected to hold total loss absorbing capacity — TLAC — of at least 18 per cent of their risk-weighted assets.The rule is one of the final elements of regulators’ efforts to bolster lenders deemed “too big to fail”.Since the financial crisis of 2008-2009 regulators have launched a succession of measures designed to ensure that taxpayers will not be burdened again in the event of another Lehman-like crisis, forcing banks to hold more capital and liquid assets while limiting the amounts they can return to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.According to S&P, the near-completion of the TLAC rulemaking means that goal is drawing closer.“We now consider the likelihood that the US government would provide extraordinary support to its banking system to be ‘uncertain’ and are removing the uplift based on government support from our ratings,” said Stuart Plesser and Devi Aurora, analysts with S&P.The long-term issuer ratings of Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were lowered from A minus to triple B plus. JPMorgan was downgraded from A to A minus, while BNY Mellon, State Street and Wells Fargo were cut from A plus to A.The Fed’s TLAC rules require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital and long-term debt at the holding company level, which can be “bailed in” to absorb potential losses from subsidiaries and to recapitalise the operating companies. This process is designed to keep operating companies ticking over while equity investors lose everything and creditors take some pain.S&P noted that it remained unsure which debt instruments would ultimately count as TLAC-eligible, but said it was satisfied that the effect of the changes would be to reduce the chances of another round of state-led bailouts.Credit strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch expect banks to aim to comply with the new capital buffers from 2019, projecting about $50bn in new debt issuance next year to address roughly two-fifths of the shortfalls.
98;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-11-19T13:05:29Z;Dollar rally loses momentum after Fed and ECB minutes;Attention turns to pace of rate tightening cycle;The attention of the foreign-exchange market shifted on Thursday from an expected December US rate rise to uncertainty about the pace of a tightening cycle, creating volatility in dollar trading.Neil Mellor, FX analyst at BNY Mellon, said: “The interest is not when the Fed moves, but what happens thereafter.”After rising on Wednesday to a seven-month high against the euro in the run-up to minutes from the Federal Reserve’s October meeting, the dollar was sold off in the European session’s Thursday morning.A similar pattern emerged after the publication of dovish minutes from the European Central Bank’s October meeting, which, according to FX strategists, point to looser monetary policy at the December meeting.The euro promptly fell 0.5 per cent against the dollar, but later recovered these losses.That left the dollar index, which tracks the world’s biggest reserve currency against a basket of its rivals, still shy of the psychologically important 100 mark, which it last touched in March.Having reached 99.85 after the Fed minutes, the index was down 0.75 per cent to 98.92. The euro ended the European session up 0.85 per cent to $1.0750.With the index having risen more than 5 per cent since mid-October, the market had priced in monetary divergence, said Mr Mellor.“The only problem I have with this divergence is everyone is going the same way. If this divergence gets traction, that’s fine. But with this absolutely dominant view, there is a significant possibility of a market shock.”Analysts expect the Fed to blend hawkish commentary about lift-off with a dovish tone on the cycle.“If, or when, they lift rates in December, the Fed will likely be very aggressive in highlighting the idea of a very gradual pace,” said Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets.Hans Redeker, head of global FX strategy at Morgan Stanley, agreed. “Our US economists now believe that the bar is low for a December lift-off from a data standpoint and suggest the focus is now likely to shift to the path of rates thereafter, where the Fed has been emphasising a gradual approach,” he said.According to David Bloom at HSBC, a shift in rates higher than expected would add strength to the dollar.“However, if at any time next year the market thinks the Fed may need to loosen in 2017, then the dollar will plummet,” he said. “The risk-reward in 2016 is for a weaker dollar. Fed rate hikes are in the price.”Mr Redeker did not think the dollar’s drift lower would last.“While our analysis suggests that historically the dollar has rallied heading into the first Fed rate hike of a tightening cycle, followed by a more mixed performance thereafter, we believe that the more challenging global environment is likely to leave it supported even once the Fed hiking cycle is under way.”Nordea warned that investors could be underestimating the potential speed of US rate rises.Martin Enlund, analyst, pointed out that the Fed was “trying to signal a hiking path in line with half the pace” of the cycle in 2004-06. “The market is pricing in half of half.”
99;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-10-30T21:38:59Z;US banks face $120bn shortfall under Federal Reserve plan;Proposed rules aim to halt systemic meltdown by tackling problem of ‘too big to fail’ lenders;Six of the biggest US banks would have to make up a $120bn shortfall in their long-term debt to boost the financial system’s resilience under a Federal Reserve proposal aimed at preventing another systemic meltdown.The proposal unveiled on Friday is part of a global regime and one of the final post-crisis steps designed to end the problem of lenders whose size and influence renders them “too big to fail”.Debate continues to rage on whether policymakers have done enough to prevent the taxpayer-funded bailouts from which the largest banks benefited during the financial crisis in 2008.The Fed’s proposed rules on banks’ “total loss absorbing capacity”, or TLAC, say banks must carry a minimum amount of capital and liabilities — equal to 18 per cent of risk-weighted assets — that can be written off when a bank gets into serious trouble.Janet Yellen, Fed chair, told an open meeting: “The proposal, combined with our other work to improve the resolvability of systemic banking firms, would substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability stemming from the failure of these firms.”The proposal affects eight US institutions designated as globally systemically important banks, or GSIBs, but the Fed would not say which six had the combined $120bn shortfall.The eight banks are JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Wells Fargo.A senior Fed official said the banks “don’t need to go out and raise massive quantities of new debt”, because they could meet the standards in other ways by, for example, shifting debt from subsidiaries to parent companies or moving soon-to-mature debt to longer maturities.The Fed estimates that compliance with the proposal would increase each bank’s annual funding costs by between $680m and $1.5bn.The proposals are part of a global regime agreed on September 25 by the Financial Stability Board, a group of regulators appointed by the G20 countries and chaired by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.John Simonson, a partner at PwC and a former deputy director at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said: “We’ve already seen higher capital requirements generally, and additional buffers for GSIBs. This is another layer to protect the banking system from potential failures, so it is an important step.”“The proposal, combined with our other work to improve the resolvability of systemic banking firms, would substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability stemming from the failure of these firmsIn the EU, divergent moves by countries to implement — and in some cases water down — the TLAC requirements have prompted the European Commission to start informal talks with national officials in an effort to co-ordinate the plans.During third-quarter earnings presentations, many US banks said they had made progress on meeting their anticipated TLAC requirements. Most cited a combination of reductions in risk-weighted assets, increases in retained earnings and additional debt issuance from holding companies.One outlier was Wells Fargo, which continues to increase its issuance needs by expanding its balance sheet. In recent months the San Francisco-based lender has announced the acquisition of about $50bn of assets, equivalent to a midsized bank.From July to September the eight GSIBs issued a total of $43bn of debt, roughly four-fifths of which came from their respective holding companies.But overall, TLAC issuance was at a “measured pace,” said Pri da Silva, an analyst at CreditSights, noting that the amount of debt issued was only slightly higher than the amount that came due during the period.“Although we expect issuances to outpace maturities through 2018, the pace may not pick up until there is clarity on US TLAC requirements and eligibility,” he said.In addition to requiring new debt issuance, the proposals could require some banks to reshape their holding companies to create a “clean” structure with fewer obligations to subsidiaries or market counterparties, said David Wright, a former Fed official who is now a managing director at Deloitte.“That requirement is an attempt to make sure that the firm can more cleanly go through a bankruptcy process in an orderly way,” he said.
100;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-10-25T04:41:12Z;Fund houses lose $700bn in ‘particularly brutal’ Q3;Seven of the largest asset managers struggled to cope with Black Monday fallout;Seven of the world’s largest fund managers collectively lost more than half a trillion dollars in assets during the third quarter as they struggled to cope with the fallout from Black Monday. The slump has sparked fears investors will pull more money during the final months of the year.The assets of BlackRock, T Rowe Price, Franklin Templeton and the fund arms of BNY Mellon, JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and State Street dropped between 4 and 11 per cent in the three months to the end of September, wiping $727.7bn off their collective asset base.The slide in assets is in stark contrast to the first half of the year, when BlackRock, JPMorgan, BofA, T Rowe Price and BNY Mellon all saw a jump in assets on the back of buoyant markets and strong investor demand.Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, the investment bank, said the third quarter was “particularly brutal”. Equity markets slumped globally during the summer amid turmoil in China, with billions wiped off the value of world markets on Black Monday in August. US and global equities had their worst quarterly performance since 2011.The assets managed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, fell by $215bn during the three months to the end of September, equivalent to the funds run by Nordea Asset Management.The fall heaps more pain on asset managers whose balance sheets are already under strain because of a price war around product fees and growing regulatory costs.Smaller fund houses Ashmore, Jupiter and Gam also reported falls in their assets under management during the quarter.Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, a consultancy, said some investors panicked during the third quarter and took flight. “Others remain, but are completely unsure which way to jump.”He warned that investors are likely to switch asset classes during the final months of the year. “We are going to see a lot of rebalancing. If [investors] do not see a lot of returns in asset class X, they will switch to asset Y.”Jake Moeller, head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, the data provider, agreed: “I would anticipate more outflows. I would expect what has started [following the situation in] China to continue.” Mr Lenardos added that the third quarter was “not a one-off”.A decline in assets directly hits profitability. Franklin’s profits slid 44 per cent during the third quarter, while BlackRock’s fell 8 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2014.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the benchmark, is up around 7 per cent this month, and some analysts believe investors are unlikely to pull money from products during the final few months of the year, especially as markets have improved.Paul McGinnis, an analyst at Shore Capital, the boutique, was doubtful the third quarter would have an impact on where investors put their money for the rest of the year. “Certainly, any institutional investors will have already been well aware of what markets were doing on a daily basis in [the third quarter] and making asset allocation decisions accordingly,” he said.Alec Lucas, an analyst at Morningstar, the data provider, added: “My guess is that those who have been in the market will not, on the whole, be spooked.“As for those who have yet to get back into the market, the volatility will probably continue to scare them off.”Bank of America, JPMorgan and BNY Mellon declined to comment. The others linked the fall in assets to market volatility and some investment strategies being out of favour.
101;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-10-20T16:14:24Z;BNY Mellon cost cuts help drive earnings;Custody bank faces pressure from activist investors to improve performance;"Cost cuts drove an improvement in underlying earnings at Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank by market capitalisation, which has been spurred by activist investors to do more to counter the profit-sapping effects of ultra-low interest rates.BNY Mellon, which keeps records, tracks performance and lends securities for institutional investors, reported a 23 per cent fall in third-quarter net income on Tuesday to $820m. But after stripping out one-off items that inflated profits last year — such as the sale of its Art Deco skyscraper at 1 Wall Street and its stake in Wing Hang, a Hong Kong bank — net income rose about 12 per cent.Earnings-per-share came to 74 cents, ahead of analysts’ expectations of 71 cents.Seven years of near-zero interest rates have reduced returns on deposits and forced BNY Mellon and many of its rivals to waive fees on money-market funds. It has also brought the 231-year-old bank to the attention of activist investors including Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, which has taken a seat on the board, and Marcato, a less friendly outfit which has criticised BNY’s “tepid” cost-cutting goals and has called for the removal of Gerald Hassell, chief executive.Todd Gibbons, chief financial officer, noted that pre-tax operating margins in the core investment services division rose to 31 per cent, up 221 basis points from the previous quarter and by 387 bps since last year. He cited new initiatives including charging clients for sending instructions by fax, insourcing certain application development activities, and putting an app on every manager’s desktop to keep closer tabs on spending.“We know who’s using what and when, and if they’re not using it, we’re shutting it down,” he told the Financial Times. “These are not one-time things; we’re really pushing out structural costs.”Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin saluted the group’s “good expense result”, but cautioned that margins could tick up again in the fourth quarter from the addition of new clients and other investments.BNY Mellon’s assets under custody or administration fell to $28.5tn from $28.6tn in the second quarter, pushed down by a stronger US dollar and lower stock prices. Assets under management closed 4 per cent lower than the previous quarter, at $1.63bn, as clients pulled out of long-term index funds and short-term cash products.Shares in BNY Mellon were up about 3 per cent by 11am in New York, pushing the stock into positive territory for the year and marking a contrast to rival State Street, which has dropped about 13 per cent since January.At a Barclays conference in New York last month, investors were polled on the factors that would prompt them to buy more shares in BNY Mellon or initiate a position in the stock. The number one response was higher short-term interest rates, with further cost cuts a distant second. Last year, the same question drew broadly similar support for costs and rates.“We look at the forward rate curves, and what that implies, and see that the market believes there is a reasonably high probability that the Fed could go as early as December,” said Mr Gibbons. “[But] we’re not exactly speculating. The way we plan is for a zero-rate environment.”"

Funding ratios (assets as a percentage of liabilities) dropped from a peak of 111 in October 2007 to a low of 67 in February 2009. They have only partially recovered to 82 despite strong gains for both equities and bonds after the financial crisis.The well-established trend of closing DB schemes in favour of defined contribution ones has raised questions about future retirement incomes.“The shift from DB to DC pensions saves money for companies but it also reduces benefits for scheme members,” said Mr Wozniak.David Knox, senior partner at Mercer, the consultancy, said the US could take a number of steps to improve its pension system.“Raising the minimum pension for low-income pensioners, raising mandatory contribution levels and improving the protection of benefits that a scheme member accrues would all be improvements”, he said.

• 4CAST Economic CalendarDiary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.Morgan Stanley performs its usual function of bringing down the curtain on earnings for the big US banks and brokers. Like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, it is likely to report a big drop in bond trading from a much livelier period between July and September last year.But investors will be focused more on the effects of that muted quarter for markets on Morgan Stanley’s core wealth management unit, which runs a gamut from mass-affluent to ultra-high net worth. The bank had been doing very well in stock-based lending, but how did that business hold up as the market plunged then staged a very wobbly recovery? Were clients spooked into pulling assets from actively-managed funds?A day after Morgan Stanley comes BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, where analysts will be watching for progress on cost cuts. In a world of near-zero interest rates, no one is expecting a lot of growth. But at a Barclays conference last month, almost two-thirds of investors said they welcomed the recent arrival of a pair of activists on the shareholder register. Ben McLannahanEARNINGSIBM Q3 $3.32 ($3.68)Morgan Stanley Q3 $0.63 ($0.65)Whitbread releases its first-half results and has steered that like-for-like sales will be up 3.9 per cent and total sales up 11.8 per cent for the six months to August 13.Costa Coffee, perhaps the jewel in Whitbread’s crown, saw sales rise 16.2 per cent worldwide and 14.8 per cent in the UK. The coffee chain has already switched to paying the new national living wage, with anyone who has completed its training now earning at least £7.40 an hour, with extra payments for staff in London.Analysts are expecting further clarity from Whitbread on its higher wage bill, while the company has said it is exploring how to trim spending in other areas. “We shall mitigate the substantial cost increase over time with a combination of productivity improvements, efficiency savings and some selective price increases,” said Andy Harrison, Whitbread’s chief executive.Premier Inn grew its sales by 11.6 per cent and said that occupancy had remained at 87 per cent in the first half. In London, sales grew by 21.1 per cent as Premier Inn opened 20.3 per cent more rooms. Jamie Rollo, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects earnings per share to grow by 13 per cent. Malcolm MooreEARNINGSBank of New York Mellon Q3 $0.71 ($0.64)Lockheed Martin Q3 $2.72 ($2.76)Whitbread H1 126.27p (110.58p)After nearly two years as General Motors’ chief executive Mary Barra will publish her first quarterly results not overshadowed by the continuing fallout from the company’s ignition switch scandal.The scandal — involving ignition switches that could move while the vehicle was being driven out of the “drive” position, disabling the engine and airbags — started to emerge in February last year, just after Ms Barra took over in January. The company put most of the issues related to the scandal behind it on September 17 when it agreed to pay a $900m criminal fine and settled many of the civil claims.The settlement means, although GM will take a $575m charge for the quarter to cover the costs, that investors’ focus will once again be firmly on core performance. Most important questions are likely to be how GM is coping with the sharp slowdown in growth in demand for cars in China and whether it is managing to increase North American profits amid booming conditions.The company is seeking to achieve 10 per cent margins on adjusted earnings before interest and tax in North America by next year. In China, meanwhile, it is seeking to encourage consumers to buy higher-margin vehicles, such as its Buick premium and Cadillac luxury brands, to improve profits as sales growth slows.Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share for the quarter of $1.19, up 47 per cent on last year’s third quarter, on sales down 2 per cent to $38.3bn. Adjusted net income, which excludes one-off expenses like the settlement charge, is projected at $1.89bn. Robert WrightSimilar to rival PepsiCo, Coca-Cola’s third-quarter earnings will probably reflect its struggle to mitigate the effect of the strong dollar and weaker macroeconomic environment in emerging markets.But analysts and investors will be looking for further signs that its efforts to reinvigorate domestic sales through smaller packaging, and its focus on soft drinks and water are paying off.Consensus analyst estimates are for sales to drop 3.5 per cent to $11.6bn, producing 50.1 cents a share, or net income of $2.2bn, a 6.3 per cent decline.Coca-Cola’s extensive overseas operations make it even more vulnerable to currency swings and its focus on soft drinks alone also sets it apart from rival Pepsi, which has the Frito-Lay snacks business in its portfolio.Investors will also be keen to hear from executives about how they will react to the recently-agreed deal whereby SABMiller is to be acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev. SAB has a distribution agreement in Africa with Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, while AB InBev has a relationship with Pepsi in Latin America.In the run-up to a deal being agreed, Coke has declined to disclose its thinking. The merger may make it impossible to maintain both relationships. But it is worth remembering that Warren Buffett has a sizeable stake in Coke and he has partnered on a number of consumer deals with 3G Capital, the private equity group, the founders of which are key investors in AB InBev and are driving this merger with SAB. Lindsay WhippOnline marketplace eBay is set to report third-quarter results, the first full quarter since its separation from PayPal was completed. It has struggled to increase revenues in recent quarters, amid intense competition from rival Amazon. Last quarter, eBay saw a drop in gross merchandising volume from the previous year, resulting in lower revenues.The fast-growing payments subsidiary PayPal was spun off in July, following pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn. EBay’s share price has slipped 14 per cent since the spin-off, amid broader market weakness.Analysts expect that the company may report weak revenues again for the third quarter. In a recent note, Barclays said third-party tracking services had highlighted potentially disappointing revenue growth. “Spending on growth and products is still needed,” analysts wrote. “It may take a bit longer to see revenue growth, margin expansion and real material capital return.” The bank expects consolidated revenue of $2.1bn in the quarter, down 4 per cent from the year prior. Leslie HookThere is no doubt that, when Boeing reports its third-quarter results the commercial and military aircraft maker will be able to report revenue rises, based on increased numbers of aircraft deliveries. The company announced on October 5 that it had delivered 199 commercial aircraft in the June to September quarter, a 7 per cent increase on the same period last year.However, there are likely to be continuing questions about whether the company is maximising the profitability of some of its critical programmes. The company said in July that it cost an average $23.2m more to produce each of its 787 Dreamliner jets than it earned from selling it. It also announced ahead of those second-quarter figures that it was taking a $536m post-tax charge for its $35bn KC-46 air tanker programme for the US military.Investors will hope for encouraging news on both aircraft. Analysts already expect earnings per share up sharply — by 14 per cent against last year’s third quarter — to $2.17. Sales are expected to show a 3.5 per cent increase, to $24.6bn.

Analysts had expected the drug to contribute $800m of revenue in 2020, rising to $2.6bn in 2025, and many downgraded their targets for the company after the news.More positively, the company recently released a study into its diabetes drug Januvia, which showed it is the first of its kind to reduce the risk of death by a serious cardiovascular event, a finding that is expected to drive increased take-up of the product.Wall Street analysts are typically expecting the company to report earnings per share of 75 cents on $4.98bn in sales.

The start up recently struck a deal with Dow Jones to offer news content in its service as it looks to battle Bloomberg, the market leader.As part of the agreement with DFS, Symphony for seven years will retain chatroom and other electronic communication sent through its platforms to or from the banks. The banks will also store duplicate copies of decryption keys for their messages with independent entities.In July, the DFS sent a letter to the banks under its jurisdiction asking for more information about Symphony’s features, such as “end-to-end encryption”.“We are pleased that these banks did the right thing by working cooperatively with us to help address our concerns about this new messaging platform,” said acting DFS superintendent Anthony Albanese. “This is a critical issue since chats and other electronic records have provided key evidence in investigations of wrongdoing on Wall Street.”It is unclear whether the 10 other financial institutions that back Symphony, but are not under DFS oversight, will agree to similar terms. The DFS said it “believes that the requirements included in today’s agreements should apply to all regulated financial institutions using Symphony in the future”.Newswire joins Wall Street-backed messaging rival to BloombergRead moreIn August, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to six federal financial regulators raising concerns about Symphony, saying the service appears to “to put companies on notice — with a wink and a nod — that they can use Symphony to reduce compliance and enforcement concerns”.Symphony has since modified its website. It no longer refers to the “guaranteed data deletion” and states that Symphony can be configured to operate with a customer’s archiving system, including messages that can be decrypted.“The agreement is another positive development on the eve of Symphony’s launch,” the company said. “Symphony’s platform safeguards against cyber threats while strengthening customers’ compliance operations and facilitating their ability to meet their regulatory obligations.”Goldman Sachs said its discussions with DFS have been constructive and “Symphony’s messaging solution addresses their concerns and further enhances our process around security and compliance”.Bank of New York Mellon said: “We’re pleased to have worked cooperatively with the New York State Department of Financial Services to help resolve their concerns on proper record retention.”Credit Suisse declined to comment. Deutsche Bank did not have an immediate comment.
106;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
107;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-08-31T14:23:37Z;BNY Mellon close to resolving software glitch;Mutual funds examine how many customer trades need reprocessing;Several large mutual fund companies are examining how many customer trades will have to be reprocessed, after Bank of New York Mellon finally delivered a week’s worth of net asset values for their funds.A software glitch last Monday meant the custodian bank had been unable to properly produce valuations, but the system was repaired over the weekend and the bank said on Monday morning that it had finally caught up.The problems have affected 20 mutual fund firms and 26 families of ETFs, including the popular Invesco PowerShares funds, which together account for about 10 per cent of US funds, although not all of their products used the damaged BNY Mellon system.The debacle added to investors’ headaches during last week’s wild market swings, leaving some investors trading on inaccurate information. For example, the PowerShares China ETF published a net asset value that was off by 2.5 per cent.With the new values, mutual fund firms will have to go back to see whether the interim numbers they used to process customer investments and redemptions last week match the final figures.Gerald Hassell, BNY Mellon chief executive, made an apology for a “very difficult week” and for the length of the outage.“It has taken us far longer than any of us would have ever expected,” he said in a conference call with clients on Sunday night.On the call, he promised funds that NAVs would be calculated properly on Monday — something of particular importance given that these will be month-end values.As well as repairing the faulty system, Mr Hassell said that BNY Mellon had also established a back-up process that did not involve SunGard Data Systems, the vendor whose software has been the source of the problem.BNY Mellon is one of the largest custodian banks, which holds assets and provides other services on behalf of investment funds. Luke Montgomery, analyst at Bernstein, said it was too early to say if the debacle would cost the bank clients.“The firm is custodian for about $250bn of US ETFs, a 12 per cent market share, and $2.2tn of US mutual funds, a 15 per cent market share,” Mr Montgomery told clients. “We do think investors should be in front of this issue.”Federated Investments, one of the affected mutual fund clients, said last week that it had found discrepancies in the numbers for Monday and Tuesday that forced it to adjust account balances for customers who traded on those days.The impact has been less severe for ETFs because NAVs act only as a guide for investors, who mainly trade their shares on exchanges. The creation of new ETF shares is set at the net asset value, but those deals take three days to settle, and BNY Mellon has never fallen more than three days behind in its calculations.Last week, BNY Mellon extracted a public apology from SunGard. Russ Fradin, the software group’s chief executive, praised the “spirit of co-operation” at BNY Mellon and said: “We at SunGard apologise to BNY Mellon for the adverse impact this unfortunate incident has had on its operations and clients.”
108;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-08-26T22:52:12Z;Funds scramble to assess computer glitch;Software problem at BNY Mellon may have led to inaccurate prices during recent market turmoil;Investment firms and regulators are scrambling to find out how many mutual funds and exchange traded funds may have reported inaccurate prices during the market turmoil of recent days, as a result of a computer glitch that affected one of the largest custodian banks.Bank of New York Mellon, whose computer systems are used to calculate the net asset values, or NAVs, of many funds, has been suffering problems since the start of the week because of a failed software upgrade by one of its suppliers.The resulting confusion could take many days to clear up, said people at several of the companies affected, and it was unclear whether investors may have ended up buying or selling funds at inaccurate prices during the high-volume trading of the past few days.One of the leading exchange-traded fund providers, Invesco PowerShares, warned on Wednesday that its family of funds may not be able to disseminate accurate price information as a result of problems at BNY Mellon. Trading is currently based on the prior day’s NAV, Invesco said.Other firms to have been affected include Prudential Financial, Federated Investors and Guggenheim Partners, said people familiar with the firms or public statements.One firm, First Trust Advisors, said it had published inaccurate NAV figures for its ETFs which it now knew to be off by more than 1 per cent.Some big fund complexes have not been affected, however, including Fidelity, which calculates its own NAVs, and State Street Global Advisors, which is owned by BNY Mellon’s rival custodian bank State Street and uses its services.Problems began on Monday as a result of a failed software upgrade by SunGard, which BNY Mellon uses as an outside supplier. The glitch was unrelated to the dramatic market moves of early Monday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which was already monitoring markets for signs of trouble at ETFs, has been working with BNY Mellon and fund companies since the issue came to light.With SunGard out of action, BNY had to rely on alternative means of calculating NAVs, and is now going back and calculating the official figures. For the most simple ETFs and other funds, there are not likely to be major discrepancies, market players said, but in more complex funds, it is possible prices were inaccurate.It was not immediately clear how investors might be compensated if any traded on inaccurate information.BNY Mellon said the system was returning to normal. “The SunGard system became available, in a limited capacity, late in the day on Tuesday,” it said. “We are working with SunGard to resume normal processing as soon as possible.”
109;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-08-18T18:51:02Z;BNY Mellon agrees to pay $15m to settle SEC internships case;Regulator alleges the bank tried to ‘corruptly influence’ foreign government officials;Bank of New York Mellon has agreed to pay almost $15m to settle allegations that it tried to “corruptly influence” foreign government officials by offering internships to family members with links to a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.In a strongly-worded statement, the Securities and Exchange Commission said the bank deserved “significant sanction” for breaching BNY Mellon’s usual recruitment processes to hire the three interns because they were “seen as important to keep the sovereign wealth fund’s business”.The sovereign wealth fund, which the US regulator did not name, had been a customer of the New York-based bank since 2000 and kept about $55bn of assets with BNY Mellon. The settlement is the first of its kind secured by the SEC, which is also examining whether other US banks’ hiring processes in Asia run foul of the US’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.The three interns were all relatives of foreign government officials and were all able to bypass BNY Mellon’s usual recruitment processes when they were hired in the summer of 2010, the SEC said, adding that they were not even interviewed.Excerpts from emails published by the regulator said that one official had become “angry” that his request for internships for his son and nephew had not yet been agreed to. This prompted a bank employee to tell a colleague “by not allowing the internships to take place, we potentially jeopardise our mandate with [the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund]”.Another employee, who had primary responsibility for managing the sovereign wealth fund’s account, wrote of the internships: “I want more money for this. I expect more for this . . . We’re doing [Official X] a favour. The same employee told the bank’s human resources office: “[W]e have to be careful about this. This is more of a personal request . . . [Official X] doesn’t want [the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund] to know about it.”The SEC concluded that: “The family members did not meet the rigorous criteria, yet were hired with the knowledge and approval of senior BNY Mellon employees in order to corruptly influence foreign officials and win or retain contracts to manage and service the assets of the sovereign wealth fund”.Without admitting or denying the findings, the bank agreed to pay $8.3m in disgorgement, $1.5m in prejudgment interest, and a $5m penalty. The lender had flagged the investigation in numerous regulatory filings, and said the outcome would not materially affect its business.“The FCPA prohibits companies from improperly influencing foreign officials with ‘anything of value’, and therefore cash payments, gifts, internships, or anything else used in corrupt attempts to win business can expose companies to an SEC enforcement action,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC enforcement division.“BNY Mellon deserved significant sanction for providing valuable student internships to family members of foreign officials to influence their actions.”BNY Mellon said it was “pleased to reach an agreement with the SEC that allows us to put this matter behind us”.“We co-operated with the SEC throughout this process, and had already taken steps to enhance our existing internal controls and procedures with respect to our internship and hiring practices,” the bank said.
110;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-07-22T21:08:38Z;NY regulator sends message to Symphony;Wall Street messaging service pressed on how it will manage data;New York’s state banking regulator has fired a shot across the bows of Symphony, a messaging service about to be launched by a consortium of Wall Street banks and asset managers, by calling for information on how it manages — and deletes — customer data.In a letter on Wednesday to David Gurle, the chief executive of Symphony Communication Services, the New York Department of Financial Services asked it to clarify how its tool would allow firms to erase their data trails, potentially falling foul of laws on record-keeping.The letter, which was signed by acting superintendent Anthony Albanese and shared with the press, noted that chatroom transcripts had formed a critical part of authorities’ investigations into the rigging of markets for foreign exchange and interbank loans. It called for Symphony to spell out its document retention capabilities, policies and features, citing two specific areas of interest as “data deletion” and “end-to-end encryption”.The letter marks the first expression of concern from regulators over a new initiative that has set out to challenge the dominance of Bloomberg, whose 320,000-plus subscribers ping about 200m messages a day between terminals using its communication tools.People familiar with the matter described the inquiry as an information gathering exercise, which could conclude that Symphony is a perfectly legitimate enterprise.The NYDFS noted that Symphony’s marketing materials state that “Symphony has designed a specific set of procedures to guarantee that data deletion is permanent and fully documented. We also delete content on a regular basis in accordance with customer data retention policies.”Mr Albanese also wrote that he would follow up with four consortium members that the NYDFS regulates — Bank of New York Mellon, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs — to ask them how they plan to use the new service, which will go live for big customers in the first week of August.The regulator said it was keen to find out how banks would ensure that messages created using Symphony would be retained, and “whether their use of Symphony’s encryption technology can be used to prevent review by compliance personnel or regulators”. It also flagged concerns over the open-source features of the product, wondering if they could be used to “circumvent” oversight.The other members of the consortium are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BlackRock, Citadel, Citigroup, HSBC, Jefferies, JPMorgan, Maverick Capital, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Together they have chipped in about $70m to get Symphony started. Another San Francisco-based fund run by a former colleague of Mr Gurle’s, Merus Capital, has a 5 per cent interest.“Symphony is built on a foundation of security, compliance and privacy features that were built to enable our financial services and enterprise customers to meet their regulatory requirements,” said Mr Gurle. “We look forward to explaining the various aspects of our communications platform to the New York Department of Financial Services.”The NYDFS occasionally makes its letters public as a means of alerting regulated firms to emerging areas of interest. Last February, for example, it began a public correspondence with Ocwen Financial, the non-bank mortgage servicing company which was rapidly picking up assets from the banks, detailing concerns over its business practices and its relations with affiliates.Additional reporting by Kara Scannell
111;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-07-20T11:39:56Z;Banks back rival to Bloomberg messaging system;Wall St groups fund Symphony application after snooping affair;A messaging service described as a WhatsApp for business is being launched by some of the world’s biggest banks in a bid to challenge Bloomberg’s dominance of the communications market.The service, Symphony, will debut two years after it emerged that Bloomberg’s reporters had used private terminal data to spy on bank employees.Many Wall Street companies communicate internally and with clients via a mish-mash of tools such as Instant Bloomberg, Eikon Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and Skype for Business.Now, if David Gurle, chief executive of Symphony Communication Services, gets his way, the banks will soon replace many of those services with his own encrypted tool, which allows users to share ideas and analysis in a secure, compliant environment.The Palo Alto-based company has been testing a beta version since April and will start selling a repackaged product to big clients — who will be charged up to $30 per user per month — from the first week of August.The software for Symphony, which sprang out of an in-house messaging project at Goldman Sachs, is open source so customers can build their own features on top, unlike the closed Bloomberg system.“We wanted a way for everybody in an organisation to have a rich communication and collaboration tool,” said Mr Gurle. At the moment, there are too many “silos of messaging islands”, he said, so people often “default to email, the only universal bridge. But [email] is not rich and powerful and does not build institutional knowledge and it is not social.”320,000Subscribers around the world using Instant BloombergRival companies have tried for years to loosen Bloomberg’s grip on messaging, and it is unclear whether a tool backed by multiple banks will flourish where others have failed. At least 320,000 Bloomberg subscribers around the world use Instant Bloomberg, while Thomson Reuters has more than 240,000 users of Eikon Messenger.Bloomberg declined to comment. A Thomson Reuters spokesperson said the company would “look to work with any partners” who share its goal of “securely connecting the broader community across financial markets”.According to Mr Gurle, the snooping scandal of May 2013 was a “trigger” for banks to review their reliance on Bloomberg terminals for functions including messaging. Then, following a complaint from Goldman, Bloomberg admitted that it had allowed reporters to access information from the terminal — including details of when clients last logged on, what dealings they had with the helpdesk and which of the terminal’s functions they were using. Such practices had ended, the company said.About a year later, Goldman merged its in-house messaging product with a similar tool that Mr Gurle had been developing and rebranded it as Symphony. These days, Goldman has an “equal voice” with 14 other financial investors which have chipped in about $70m of funding, said Mr Gurle.[Email] is not rich and powerful and does not build institutional knowledge and it is not socialThe full line-up consists of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNY Mellon, BlackRock, Citadel, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Jefferies, JPMorgan, Maverick Capital, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and Wells Fargo.A free version of the Symphony platform will be offered to the public from mid-September, and a cheaper format for smaller companies should follow soon after, said Mr Gurle.There was no reason that Symphony could not extend into other industries such as healthcare, said Salman Ullah, a partner at Merus Capital, a Palo Alto-based venture firm, and a former colleague of Mr Gurle’s at Microsoft. Merus backed Symphony’s seed-funding round and is now the only non-Wall Street investor, with about 5 per cent.“We think this could be a WhatsApp for enterprises,” said Mr Ullah, citing the instant-messaging app owned by Facebook. “It is one thing being able to talk to people within a company, but it’s another thing to message outside the company, in a completely frictionless and secure way.”He cited an email he had just received from his stockbroker at Fidelity, asking him to check the company’s own website for a reply to an inquiry.“That is hardly state of the art,” he said.

As the bank’s auditor, KPMG examined whether BNY Mellon’s custody arrangements complied with UK client asset rulesA spokesperson for KPMG said: “We are committed to setting the highest standards in our work and will co-operate fully with the FRC in its inquiries.”Custody rules require customer accounts to be kept properly ringfenced to ensure that if a company becomes insolvent, client money can be returned relatively quickly. They came into the spotlight after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when its UK clients struggled to access their assets.Anxious to prevent a repeat, the then regulator, the Financial Services Authority, began probing whether other banks and asset managers were complying with the client assets rules. It found many were not and a long string of penalties have followed.The largest of these came in April, when the FSA’s successor, the Financial Conduct Authority fined BNY and its international subsidiary £126m for failing to “adequately record, reconcile and protect safe custody assets”.At the time, Georgina Philippou, acting director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said that the firms’ failure to comply with the rules “was particularly serious given the systematically important nature of the firms and the fact that safeguarding assets is core to their business”.The KPMG investigation is not the first time that a client asset case has led to an auditing probe. PwC was fined £1.4m and given a severe reprimand in January 2012 by the accountancy regulator over its audits of JPMorgan during a seven-year period when the US bank’s London arm failed to safeguard billions of pounds of clients’ assets. JPMorgan was itself fined £33m by the FSA in June 2010.The FRC is also probing PwC’s reporting to the FSA over its audits of Barclays between 2007-2011. Again, the watchdog’s decision to investigate came after a big fine. Barclays paid £37.7m for failing to keep appropriate records on the £16.5bn or so of clients’ money that its investment bank placed with custodians between 2007 and 2012.

115;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-06-03T10:26:34Z;Women run just 2% of fund management assets in the US;Females more likely to become doctors, lawyers or accountants than portfolio managers, study finds;Women run just 2 per cent of fund management assets in the US and are much more likely to become doctors, lawyers or accountants than portfolio managers, according to new findings from Morningstar.The research group said women are “scarce” among US fund managers, prompting concern that investors are ultimately being harmed by the huge gender gap between male and female fund managers.The study shows that women make up fewer than 10 per cent of 7,700 US portfolio managers, and that just 184 of 7,000 US mutual funds are run only by women.Erin Davis, senior banking analyst at Morningstar, said: “Investors are losing out as a result of this. A more diverse management produces better results. It is clear the industry is also missing out on a host of untapped talent.”She added: “The fund industry’s leadership ranks are less diversified than other comparable professions. A woman is much less likely to be running a US mutual fund than working as a doctor, where the ratio is 37 per cent, or a lawyer, where the ratio is 33 per cent.”Research released today from the UK also shows that just 7 per cent of UK funds are managed or co-managed by women, a figure unchanged from the previous year.Jason Hollands, managing director of business development and communications at Tilney Bestinvest, the broker that collated the results, said: “Despite a handful of high-profile women in senior management positions within the industry, front-office positions continue to be male dominated and dramatically out of line with the proportion of women graduating from universities.”The UK ratio figure reflects a large disparity compared with the number of women represented in senior positions in other professions, he said, as well as the proportion of women represented on the boards of FTSE 100 companies, where women account for 23 per cent of positions.Helena Morrissey, chief executive of BNY Mellon subsidiary Newton and a leading activist for gender equality in the workplace, added: “The lack of progress is very disappointing but sadly not a surprise. As an industry we need to do a better job explaining what we actually do, including our social purpose, so that new types of people might be attracted to fund management. It is time to redouble our efforts to do something about this.”At the end of 2014, FTfm asked the 10 largest independent fund houses in the US and Europe to provide information on how many women they employ and at what level.Only one fund company shared that information: Aberdeen Asset Management. The remaining nine groups declined (BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity Investments, Franklin Templeton and Capital Group in the US, and Schroders, Union Investment, Lombard Odier and Pictet Asset Management in Europe).Anne Richards, chief investment officer of Aberdeen, told FTfm: “There is no quick fix to this. But it is quite anachronistic that the fund rating agencies still focus on a single named individual on a fund while many funds are managed by a team. Rating teams by their diversity and including that as part of the overall ‘star’ rating might increase the focus on diversity.”
116;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-05-18T16:30:27Z;Why multi-boutiques are so on-trend;Funds of hedge funds are benefiting from the hunt for yield;It is the fastest-growing asset manager you’ve probably never heard of. Affiliated Managers Group, with some $638bn of assets to its name, is at the vanguard of a new trend of investing in other money managers, most notably those that run hedge funds. Over the past decade, AMG has grown from nothing to rank on a par with the world’s top 20 fund managers. Its share price has risen 20 per cent over the past year and, over five years, it is up 188 per cent — double the rate of the S&P 500.Now, the group is planning to expand in Europe and increase the share of assets it allocates to European money managers from the current 25 per cent. As of next month chief executive Sean Healey will split his time between London and the US.AMG is not alone. Legg Mason, Bank of New York Mellon, Old Mutual, Principal Global Investors and a clutch of other companies have similar operations. Most of them are in rapid growth mode. But are these “managers of managers” effectively parasites or useful intermediaries?So far, with investors examining all ways of eking out better yields, the general view is positive.The hunger for yield is helping most fund managers. BlackRock, the world’s biggest, now has $4.8tn of assets under management, an increase of 8 per cent year on year. However, the appeal of the “multi-boutiques” can be even greater. Shares in OM Asset Management — Old Mutual’s US arm, which has just this remit — have risen 37 per cent since the business was floated last autumn. BlackRock shares are up 14 per cent over the same period.Such firms are taking over the role that banks and insurance companies have played in recent years. Under pressure from post-crisis regulations — such as the US Volcker rule that limits banks’ ownership of hedge funds — Morgan Stanley has been exploring a sale of its 19 per cent stake in UK hedge fund Lansdowne Partners. AMG is among a handful of potential buyers. Similarly, Deutsche Bank is selling its 17.5 per cent stake in Arrowgrass Capital Partners, Highbridge has been seeking a buyout from JPMorgan and Swiss Re may sell its 15 per cent stake in Brevan Howard.True to form, one bank that appears an outlier with its commitment to the multi-boutique strategy, is Goldman Sachs. By structuring its investments via third-party Petershill private equity funds, it avoids the proscriptions of the Volcker rule. After a decent, if patchy, record with Petershill I, Goldman is now raising $1bn for Petershill II and has already bought stakes in a few managers including Caxton Associates.Investment from multi-boutiques brings two obvious pluses for hedge funds: it helps them manage the succession process, and it can help with distribution and back-office functionsThe growing appeal of such stakes comes even as hedge funds’ own performance has attracted criticism. Last year, the industry as a whole returned an average of 3 per cent — less than a quarter of the total return of the S&P 500. Some of the world’s largest pension funds, such as Calpers in the US and PFZW in the Netherlands, have announced plans to axe their hedge fund holdings altogether, criticising their returns, manager pay and fees.But if the standard “2 and 20” fee structure — a 2 per cent annual management fee plus a 20 per cent slice of investment gains — is off-putting for some investors, it is a draw for those taking stakes in the funds themselves. AMG and OM get some of the diversification benefits of hedge funds of funds (which invest in other hedge funds) but with a steady stream of income and far less of the investment risk.From the hedge funds’ point of view, investment from these multi-boutiques brings two obvious pluses. First, it helps them manage the often delicate process of succession. Thanks to the valuation and equity injection that come with an outside investment, it becomes easier for a founding team of managers to pass the reins to the next generation. Second, it can help with distribution and back-office functions. The hedge fund wins a new outlet to market, plus a partner who may take on some of the bureaucracy that might otherwise distract its crack investment team.Judging by the stock market performance of the listed multi-boutique vehicles, this formula is a winning one. Some are reckoned to trade at a premium of about 40 per cent to the value of their underlying funds. The big question is how sustainable it is for an asset manager (the multi-boutique firm) to invest in asset managers (the hedge funds) that in turn manage the money of asset managers (the pension funds) on behalf of individuals. Investment performance has to be good to offset one set of fees, let alone three.patrick.jenkins@ft.com

118;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-05-13T11:31:01Z;Activist investors take aim at chief of Bank of New York Mellon;Management at the US’s oldest bank faces unusually fierce challenge from Marcato and Trian;The Wall Street offices of Bank of New York Mellon are steeped in the history of its famous founder, Alexander Hamilton. Yet among the 18th century artefacts there is no sign of the founding father’s duelling pistols.“JPMorgan has those,” says Gerald Hassell, who has silently entered the room and answers the query. The pistols, says BNY Mellon’s chief executive, belonged to Aaron Burr, who killed Hamilton, and founded his own bank, which today is part of JPMorgan Chase.Mr Hassell is involved in his own battle for survival and needs all the firepower he can muster. He is threatened by activist investors who are mounting an unusually fierce challenge at the oldest US bank, in a sector usually considered too tough for campaigning shareholders to take on, on the grounds that returns are too low and costs are out of control.Trian Fund Management, led by Nelson Peltz, fought for and won a seat on the board last year — a perch from which to orchestrate change at the world’s largest custody bank, which does foreign exchange, securities lending and clearing for institutional clients and looks after about $28.5tn of assets.Marcato Capital Management, an upstart San Francisco-based group, has gone further, arguing for thousands of job cuts among the 50,000 workforce, including Mr Hassell’s.“This management team has time and again both failed to reach its own, tepid goals and failed to keep up with its competition,” says Mick McGuire, who founded Marcato in 2010 after earlier working for Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square. “We sincerely doubt that meaningful progress will be achieved without new executive talent. Bank of New York is a great business and a great franchise. It deserves great management.”Trian is ostensibly friendlier. “Everyone seems open to new perspectives and constructive debate,” says Ed Garden, chief investment officer of Trian and the new BNY Mellon director. “To be clear — the board supports Gerald and the management team and we will hold them accountable for meeting the company’s financial targets. We are on the right path now but need to stay very focused on continuing to improve operating performance.”It has suited both Trian and BNY Mellon to play down the hostility between the two sides.“When I first met the Trian team I said, ‘Look, if you’ve got ideas to make us better I’m all ears,’ ” says Mr Hassell. “I like dealing with people who are smart and knowledgeable and factual because you may disagree but you can have a constructive dialogue, and we’ve had a constructive dialogue.”According to two people familiar with the matter, Mr Hassell resisted giving Trian a seat on the board and Trian, in spite of suggestions to the contrary, threatened a damaging “proxy fight” to rally other shareholders.It is not the first period of strife in the recent history of the bank, which merged with The Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007 and has never since produced a return on equity of 10 per cent.Mr Hassell, 63, a 40-year veteran of Bank of New York, was appointed after his predecessor Bob Kelly was ousted in 2011, an unusual move for a large financial group’s board. It is an open question whether directors who have thrown out one chief executive are more or less likely to keep his successor.Everyone accepts that BNY Mellon has been hit hard by the ultralow interest rate environment, which depresses the margins between the rate the bank pays on its large deposit base and the rate it earns on its investment. The question is whether Mr Hassell could have done more to mitigate the impact.He concedes that the results could have been better but says that that is a side-effect of a structural overhaul, which is starting to pay dividends.“I was very focused on changing some of the culture, some of the dynamics, putting a stake in the ground on the operations, dealing with the regulatory environment, dealing with litigation environment and investing in things for the future, all simultaneously,” he says. “I think shareholders said, ‘That’s great, but I’d like more current performance as well.’ ”Mr Hassell said he always believed that changes he made, such as bringing a vast technology team in-house at considerable expense, would pay off. “What I could see that the investor couldn’t see was that I knew it [the improved performance] was coming but it wasn’t coming fast enough.”A strong first quarter has given Mr Hassell breathing room from the activist attacks, after the bank handily beat analysts’ expectations. But Marcato, in particular, remains dissatisfied.Reasonable people can disagree about the health of the business and the strength of management. Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA, agrees with Marcato that the bank’s expenses are too high and suggests that it should consider spinning off its asset management arm.Betsy Graseck, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says that expenses are not out of line with rivals such as State Street. “The truth is that the investment servicing business is labour intensive,” she wrote in a recent note.But the activists have brought — or at least coincided with — a more intense focus on costs. The 1 Wall Street building where Mr Hassell sits, with its grand art deco entrance hall bedecked in blood red and gold mosaics, has been sold for $585m and BNY Mellon is moving to a less ornate space across the road from Goldman Sachs.Mr Hassell has resisted the calls from Marcato to cull thousands of people, but he has frozen a defined-benefit pension scheme and says “the number of employees should come down” with increased automation. The efficiency drive has extended into the post room where BNY Mellon is mailing out less bumph, at a saving of $17m.Still some analysts and shareholders contrast BNY Mellon’s cost-cutting effort unfavourably with those of State Street, which has had its own brush with Trian. It has launched three rounds of redundancies in three years and said this year that it would wring further savings through technological improvements.“We have not stepped down our efforts at all,” Jay Hooley, State Street chief executive, told the Financial Times recently. “You should do everything you can to drive efficiency, and if you don’t, someone else will.”

Following a review of the business, it will continue to offer clearing services to customers in Japan, Nomura confirmed.Its departure from two of the world’s largest regions for derivatives trading follows a host of other banks also retreating in the last year. Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street and BNY Mellon have cited high costs for their pullout.After the financial crisis global policy makers have sought to make markets safer by pushing more deals through clearing houses, which ensure trades are completed if one counterparty defaults.The push to clearing has also brought increased capital, operating and investment costs for banks, reducing potential margins for profit. However Europe is yet to finalise its clearing mandate and harmonise it with two-year old US rules. The delays have made it uneconomic for many smaller players.“Due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory and market environment associated with OTC client clearing, we are exiting the OTC derivatives client clearing businesses in the Americas and Emea,” the bank said in a statement.It added it would instead focus on trading both OTC derivatives and exchange-traded futures. The latter are cheaper for investors to trade.Nomura’s retreat amplifies growing market concerns that swaps clearing is concentrating among just a few bank clearers, known as futures commission merchants in the US. The five largest account for more than 70 per cent of the market by the amount of customer collateral required, according to data for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.In the US Nomura was required to hold just $26m in client collateral to cover its clients trades — an indicator of the amount of business an FCM is doing — according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from March 31. Credit Suisse, the largest swaps clearer, was required to hold almost $12bn.“They have struggled to find clients to put on the platform,” said a clearing source at a rival bank, speaking before the announcement. “It’s a hard business at the moment. For a lot of the smaller guys it really isn’t very compelling.”

Analysts had expected $0.59 a share in earnings.The improved performance, built on a surge in foreign exchange trading revenue and lower costs, drove BNY Mellon’s shares up 3 per cent to their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.Gerald Hassell, chief executive, said the results showed “continued progress in executing on our strategic priorities”, with “success in holding our expenses in check”.Marcato Capital Management, an activist fund, has called for Mr Hassell to be fired, in part because of what it describes as a persistent failure to keep costs under control. Trian Fund Management, an activist fund led by Nelson Peltz, has also demanded improvements at BNY Mellon and won a seat on the board, although Trian has backed the management.BNY Mellon keeps records and lends securities for institutional clients and manages investment for institutions and individuals.Choppy foreign exchange markets helped BNY Mellon in the quarter, with trading revenues for the segment up 67 per cent at $229m “driven by higher volumes and volatility”. A swing in the value of the Swiss franc was among the turbulent activity in currencies during the quarter and caused some banks, including Citigroup, to lose money but BNY Mellon had been expected to profit since it takes relatively little risk in the market.The FCA on Wednesday slammed custodian Bank of New York Mellon with an unprecedented fine for failing to comply with its Client Assets Sourcebook rules (the CASS rules) throughout the period of 2007-2013.Continue readingDuring the quarter BNY Mellon paid $700m to settle allegations from the US attorney in Manhattan Preet Bharara and New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman that the bank misled investors about the price it was transacting foreign exchange on their behalf. In a separate legal problem earlier this month BNY Mellon paid £126m to settle charges from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority that it failed to comply with rules that require customer accounts to be kept properly ringfenced.Overall revenue increased 6 per cent to $3.9bn. That was ahead of analysts’ estimates but the biggest beat came on the expense line, the area where BNY Mellon has been most criticised for having too many people and paying them too much. Non-interest expense fell 1 per cent to $2.7bn.Todd Gibbons, chief financial officer, said the company “froze our defined benefit plan in the US”, sold 750,000 sq ft of property in New York and stopped sending so much mail as part of an effort to control costs."

Speaking at an event in Washington DC, Mr Jaitley reiterated that global funds had the right to launch an appeal against the tax claims, but that they could not expect him to scrap the charges entirely.“For the future, I have abolished it,” he said. “Their expectation is that, having lost the case, the state must now intervene. That looks a little difficult from my point of view.”● Related FT view: Modi must tame tax systemFines fail to spur banks into action on client cashThe UK’s finance regulator handed out record fines this week in two of its ongoing probes, in a sign that the watchdog will not go lightly on companies repeating others’ mistakes.Bank of New York Mellon, the largest custody bank, was fined £126m for failing to comply with rules on ringfencing client accounts, while Clydesdale Bank was fined £21m for failings around selling payment protection insurance.The Financial Conduct Authority’s fine against BNY Mellon, for failings over a six-year period, was the eighth-largest imposed by the regulator. No clients suffered any loss, the bank said.Custody rules are intended to keep customer money safe in case a bank collapses, an issue that came to light after Lehman Brothers’ insolvency led to years of litigation over commingled accounts.John Elkann, 39, the scion of the Agnelli dynasty behind Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, this week signalled his corporate coming of age.Continue readingClydesdale’s offences included staff falsifying information on its policies, and in some cases, deleting them. The bank’s PPI handlers, starting in mid-2011, also failed to take into account some relevant documents when deciding how to deal with cases, according to the regulator.Banks have set aside a total of £24bn as compensation to date, underlining PPI as the costliest financial mis-selling debacle in the UK. Redress costs have been worse than expected, rising to £424.5m in January this year — the highest level for 14 months. Clydesdale has set aside a total £806m for PPI complaints, of which £291m had been used as of October last year.Both banks co-operated with the FCA’s probes.● Related FT Alphaville: BNY Mellon, an expensive caseBuyout groups still exerting themselves on fitness chainsAll but the most dedicated of gym-goers will have forgotten their New Year’s resolutions by now, but private equity interest in health and fitness chains shows no sign of abating, writes Kadhim Shubber.Guy Hands entered the race to secure the remainder of LA Fitness’s struggling business, while South African retail billionaire Christo Wiese splashed £682m on an 80 per cent stake in Virgin Active.The Virgin Active deal, in which CVC Capital Partners exited the business and Richard Branson’s Virgin Group more than halved its stake, came as the global chain of 267 gyms was preparing to float next month.Breit, the investment company majority owned by Mr Wiese, said the deal gave Virgin Active an enterprise value of £1.3bn. It would help Virgin Active open between 12 and 15 gyms a year, the health and fitness chain said.LA Fitness now has at least three possible suitors, with Terra Firma competing against gym operators Pure Gym and Fitness First for 43 gyms in London and the southeast of England valued at up to £80m.The business, which underwent a company voluntary arrangement last year and sold 33 gyms to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, has been squeezed by the rise of discount gyms and, at the top of the market, by specialised health chains.However, the sale may attract the attention of competition authorities. Pure Gym’s merger with The Gym Group was blocked last year, and while the discount gym chain has little overlap with LA Fitness’s estate, rival Fitness First is more exposed.● Related FT news: The must-have extras in the race to fitnessMayer pushes Yahoo deeper into searchMarissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, has been trying to turnround the ageing internet company for almost three years — but so far, has not been able to change its search business, which contributes over a third of the revenue, writes Hannah Kuchler.This week, she announced a renegotiated agreement with Microsoft, which provides the search engine Bing to Yahoo users while allowing Yahoo to control the advertising that appears next to it. The new deal will allow Yahoo to experiment with up to 49 per cent of its search traffic in the next five years.Many analysts had expected a more dramatic deal — potentially abandoning a pact with Microsoft — but the settlement was greeted mostly positively.Ms Mayer was hired to head Yahoo because of her flair for product design and experience, which she pursued at her former home of Google, focusing on search. She could now invent a whole new way of searching the web, for example, using the anticipatory service Aviate that Yahoo bought last year, which predicts what a user will want in real time.The biggest move she could make would be to send that 49 per cent of traffic to Google, the dominant player and the best at monetising search. A Yahoo-Google deal was previously blocked by antitrust concerns but both companies have lost some market share to Bing since then, so it could be possible.For Microsoft the deal means its premium advertising sales team will be able to build links with marketers, with faster feedback for its search product from the people who pay for it.And finally . . . the lighter side of the news● In the movies, good always prevails.

Barclays was fined £38m in September, its second for client money failings, and several investigations are said to be still ongoing.Legal experts said that while some of the rules breaches are historic, there is still confusion around the regulator’s client money rules, and as banks grow larger and systems are combined, incremental issues can go unnoticed.“There’s still interpretation as to what they’re requiring of firms,” said Michael Ruck, a regulatory lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London, who used to work at the regulator. “Certain aspects are pretty clear and have been further clarified by the FCA, but there are other aspects of that regime that continue to be opaque.”The size of the fine, despite the fact that none of BNY Mellon’s accounts were compromised, reflects the FCA’s intention to penalise companies that still are not complying, lawyers said.BNY Mellon played down the scale of the commingling of money from the bank with that of clients. “As part of our ongoing review we discovered isolated instances in which firm assets were misdirected into three client omnibus accounts, representing a tiny fraction of the assets held in these accounts.”The assets were immediately segregated and no client assets were ever held in firm accounts, the bank said. However, BNY Mellon’s offences took place over a six-year period and did not end until 2013, well after the FCA’s warning and JPMorgan’s fine.BNY Mellon’s fine is by far the largest, followed by Barclays, JPMorgan with a £33.3m penalty, and BlackRock, which paid £9.5m in 2012. In total, 17 companies have been fined, including Aberdeen Asset Managers and Aberdeen Fund Management, Xcap Securities, SEI Investments, Christchurch Investment Management, Integrated Financial Arrangements, Towry Investment Management, ActivTrades, Rowan Dartington & Co and Close Investments. Fourteen of those have come since JPMorgan was penalised in 2010.The rules, intended to keep customer money safe and easily returnable if a bank collapses, became a focus for the FCA’s predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, after commingled accounts at Lehman were tied up during a lengthy court battle.The FSA sent letters, first to compliance officers, then to CEOs in 2010, ordering them to have systems in place to prevent a repeat of the debacle in case a financial services company became insolvent.“Those letters partly articulated regulatory expectations of firms holding client assets, but still left a degree of ambiguity and subjective judgment to be applied by individual firms,” said Douglas Cherry, a lawyer at Eversheds. “The historic lack of total clarity has contributed, in some cases, to a degree of mismatch between industry practice and understanding and regulatory expectations.”In some cases, it is a matter of companies growing larger and not always properly merging systems, some lawyers said.“Some of it is about accretion,” said Sarah Thomas, a regulatory lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills. “The size and complexity of firms develop over time and there isn’t always a fresh, from-the-start check. The increasing complexity can lead to divergence from the rules, and there are assumptions about how internal systems work that get embedded and aren’t looked at with a fresh view — that leads to problems being undetected.”Hywel Jenkins, also a regulatory lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills, said the technical aspects of separating accounts can become tricky and small issues can multiply quickly.“These things go unnoticed and then if you multiply that with the vast sums under management, they can be quite tiny incremental issues, but because they extend over time and large sums of money are involved, it just gets multiplied up,” he said.New rules will come into effect next year that will hold a senior manager accountable for any client money failings, meaning fines against companies are likely to be accompanied by penalties against a director.“This will be a key area where a board director or someone very senior is going to have to ensure that the client asset systems are functioning properly,” Mr Jenkins said. “They’re going to be heavily delegating, so it’s going to really highlight the need for those senior individuals to think quite carefully as to how they’re protecting themselves.”The regulator said separating client accounts is still a priority area. BNY Mellon’s fine ranks as one of the FCA’s largest, lagging only behind the penalties for foreign exchange and Libor manipulation and against JPMorgan Chase for failing to stop a record trading loss by former trader Bruno Iksil, known as the ‘London Whale’.“No firm ever intends to fail to meet their regulatory requirement,” Mr Ruck of Pinsent Masons said. “The vast majority employ a large amount of resources to meet those, but clearly some firms still don’t.”Additional reporting by Martin Arnold
124;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-04-15T10:28:19Z;UK regulator hits BNY Mellon with record £126m fine;US bank failed to comply with customer account ringfencing rules;Bank of New York Mellon has been fined a record £126m by the UK regulator for failing to comply with rules that require customer accounts to be kept properly ringfenced.Between 2007 and 2013, the US bank’s London branch and its international unit failed to comply with custody rules and did not prevent client money from commingling with the bank’s proprietary accounts, the Financial Conduct Authority said.Its fine is the largest it has levied for client money failings and is the eighth largest ever imposed by the UK watchdog.Custody rules are intended to keep customer money safe in case a bank collapses and to ensure that money can be returned relatively quickly.“Had the firms become insolvent, the total value of safe custody assets at risk would have been significant,” said Georgina Philippou, the FCA’s acting head of enforcement. “This is compounded by the fact that the breaches took place at a time when there was considerable stress in the market.”After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the FCA’s predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, reviewed banks’ compliance with client asset rules, which resulted in years of litigation. Barclays was fined twice by the regulator for client money failings: £1.13m in early 2011 and then £38m last September. JPMorgan was fined £33m in 2010 for mixing up to $23bn of its clients’ money with its own funds.BNY Mellon failed to implement sufficient governance arrangements or to spot the errors, which were uncovered during a routine regulatory review, the FCA said. No clients suffered any loss, the bank said. Its London branch and international unit hold money for more than 6,000 clients in the UK.News of the fine comes at a time when BNY Mellon is also being targeted by shareholder activists. Trian Partners, the activist investment firm run by Nelson Peltz, has taken a 2.7 per cent stake and last year successfully lobbied for a board seat. Marcato Capital Management, which has 1.6 per cent stake, has taken a more hostile stance, arguing for new leadership.In a statement last month, Marcato said: “Management has done a poor job creating value through this changing environment and offers no new ideas for facing current and future challenges.”This activist pressure follows persistently weak returns caused, in part, by the ultra-low interest rate environment which has depressed BNY Mellon’s margins.Its FCA fine was reduced by 30 per cent for co-operating with the regulator, and was fully covered by pre-existing legal reserves, the bank said.A person familiar with the situation said that no more than 0.06 per cent of the firm’s assets were ever held in the wrong accounts. “This was an administrative error,” explained the person, who said that the majority of wrongdoing found by the FCA related to record keeping and the accounting for client assets at a group level rather than at a specific business entity level.Additional reporting by Tom Braithwaite in New York and Martin Arnold in London
125;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-04-12T01:25:09Z;Oddo outlines growth plans after BNY deal;French investment group plans to hire new staff and expand organically in Europe;French investment group Oddo & Cie plans to hire new staff and expand beyond its core European markets after acquiring Meriten, the Düsseldorf-based BNY Mellon subsidiary, last week.Nicolas Chaput, chief executive of Oddo AM, told FTfm that the merger will not result in redundancies for any of the 180 Meriten employees in Düsseldorf or the 108 Oddo investment staff based predominantly in France.Once the deal has completed the combined asset management group, which will be rebranded as Oddo Meriten Asset Management, will become the eurozone’s third-largest independent fund house, with more than €40bn of assets.Mr Chaput said: “This transaction will be about growth — we are not doing it to reduce costs. We will hire new talent and we want to attract people from any country as long as they are the best.“Becoming the third most important asset manager in the eurozone will give us more leverage [to hire]. I think we have the right talents today but we will be a new pole of attraction for people as well.”Mr Chaput declined to comment on how many new hires he anticipated but said he is keen to reinforce the group’s European equity and asset allocation teams, and improve its relationship with independent financial advisers in Germany.He added that Oddo, which bought Seydler Bank, the Frankfurt-based investment bank, from Close Brothers in January, is not looking to make further acquisitions, although it would like to expand beyond its core markets of France, Germany, Italy and the Middle East through organic growth. The company is eyeing the UK market in particular.“We want to make sure the merger works [and] we are not in talks with anyone else. The focus will be on building a single company and culture, delivering top-notch quality to current clients and capturing new ones,” the chief executive said.“Our presence in the UK today is limited and that [market] is something obviously we have in mind. We know the UK is the largest [investment market in Europe] so it is of interest to us, but we need to [prepare] a real value proposition.”Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, an asset management consultancy, expressed doubt over whether the combined group would pose a strong competitive threat to larger asset managers across Europe.“With minimal overlaps in their product and client bases, this merger between two speciality boutiques makes a lot of sense. Both were caught in the familiar ‘mid-tier trap’, forcing each to remain sub-scale,” he said.“The combined group will have a broader base of the capabilities that are so essential in the fast-growing area of multi-asset class products, but it is unlikely to make waves. The combined size of the new group will not pack a big punch.”Oddo Asset Management currently ranks 41st out of 150 fund companies in Europe in terms of brand recognition, according to Fund Buyer Focus, an asset management research firm, which interviewed 500 fund selectors such as private banks and platforms to compile the ranking.Diana Mackay, chief executive of Fund Buyer Focus, said she expected Oddo Meriten to have some success in building its profile across Europe.“There is no doubt that the French boutiques have been very effective cross-border players. Oddo has a quite a good profile and is a well-recognised boutique [outside of its home market]. The group is not in the top tier but it is certainly there [in terms of brand recognition],” she said.
126;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-04-09T15:39:38Z;University rowers make a splash for women in sport;Female team takes part in Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race over same course and for equal prize money;"Women’s rowing has come a long way since the first boat races on the Thames in 1833, when the wives and daughters of fishermen would compete for purses of sovereigns.When the historic Oxford and Cambridge university Boat Race starts this weekend, it will be the first time the women’s rowing team has raced along the same stretch of the Thames on the same day as the men.It has taken the women’s team 88 years since their first race to gain total parity with the men’s competition, with Saturday’s race also marking equality of the sexes in sponsorship and television coverage.Helena Morrissey — chief executive of sponsors Newton Investment Management, a BNY Mellon investment subsidiary — emphasised the women’s race was being held with “the money split equally and [with] complete equality”.Ms Morrissey — who is also head of the 30 Per Cent Club that aims to get more women into British boardrooms — had refused to listen to arguments that women’s eights were not physically capable of negotiating the swirling tides and twisting bends of the course along the river between Putney and Mortlake in west London.Holly Hill, number six for Cambridge, said Newton’s financing had “lifted the sport and given us the chance to play out our challenge on the biggest stage”. She said Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign, which aims to get more women into fitness and sport, and the move of women’s varsity rugby to Twickenham stadium in December, had also helped.For the cause of equality and the benefit to women’s rowing, it is not before time that Oxbridge’s women are finally racing on the tideway with the men. It is, in fact, decades late, writes Lucy Colback.When I coxed in the early 1990s, women’s rowing clubs at Cambridge were woefully underfunded. That may have mattered less at the college level, where everyone paid their own way and the pot was supposedly communal. But at the university level, Cambridge university Women’s Boat Club were very disadvantaged (I expect Oxford was little different).While the men were treated to free corporate-emblazoned gear, we paid for all our own kit and training camps. We practised against floods at Wallingford; the men went to the continent. The men were invited to regattas in Barcelona and Lyons; the women raced on unmemorable UK rivers. I still have the two long-sleeved T-shirts that the men’s corporate sponsor was generous enough to provide us, but after much wrangling. The lettering looks like CUMBC instead of CUWBC.We did not resent the men for this, and they were no more arrogant towards us than young athletes are wont to be towards outsiders; the women were just not part of the same club. Now, at last, they are.Melissa Wilson, who sits at five for Cambridge, said: “There was very little funding in female athletics until Newton stepped up. I know this is a new step in the women’s boat race and hope it is a great race that goes down in history.”Robert Gillespie, chairman of the Boat Race Company, said that, in setting up the dual event on Saturday, the backers had been on “a journey . . . outside the realms of traditional sports sponsorship.”Curtis Arledge, chief executive of investment management at BNY Mellon, said it was an easy decision to sponsor a quintessentially British sporting event for five years. “It’s beyond a sport, it’s a history and a heritage.”For such a historic day, organisers hope drama is confined to a titanic struggle between the 32 athletes. In the 70th women’s boat race on Saturday, Cambridge lead the tally by 40-29, but Oxford have won 11 of the past 15 races.In a reminder of the fickle fortunes of the river, Oxford university’s women’s crew had to be rescued by the Chiswick RNLI lifeboat last week during a training session in which their boat was swamped in excessive wind against the tide.Whatever the outcome, the day will be remembered for student women racing the same gruelling course an hour before the men.However, most moves towards equality in the sport surfaced more than 40 years ago. In the US, a federal law, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education programme or activity.In 1976, Yale University’s women rowers took action in protest at the lack of facilities. For instance, the men’s team had new boats, a locker room and hot showers while the women had make-do boats, no locker room and their showers did not work.The team stripped off their sweatshirts in front of Joni Barnett, Yale’s director of women’s athletics, with the press present, to reveal “Title IX” written on their backs, declaring: “These are the bodies Yale is exploiting.”American Daphne Martschenko, seven in the Cambridge boat this year, said: “It was a moment that defined history, and shaped the lives of women who were to come afterwards in sport in the US.”The women’s race is at 4.50pm and the men’s at 5.50pm."

128;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-03-27T21:10:02Z;BNY Mellon directors quizzed on CEO hunt;US bank denies it is conducting a search to replace Gerald Hassell;Bank of New York Mellon directors have been quizzed on whether they initiated a hunt for a new chief executive, according to people familiar with the matter, in the latest intrigue to hit the custody bank.Directors were reminded that a unilateral search to replace Gerald Hassell as chief executive would be a breach of fiduciary duty, one person said.But each director denied asking Spencer Stuart, a recruitment agency, to look for possible successors. Wesley von Schack, a former energy industry executive, serves as lead independent director. Mr Hassell is chairman as well as chief executive.Reuters reported on Friday that Spencer Stuart — “at the prompting of at least one director” — had drawn up a list of potential chief executives, including Greg Fleming, who runs wealth and investment management at Morgan Stanley.An unauthorised search to replace Mr Hassell would add to the drama at BNY Mellon, which has attracted activist investors looking to improve shareholder returns.Last year Trian Fund Management, led by Nelson Peltz and Ed Garden, took a $1bn stake in the company. It now has a 2.7 per cent stake and BNY Mellon gave Mr Garden a board seat last year to avoid a proxy fight. Like other directors, Mr Garden told the board that he had not initiated a chief executive search. Trian declined to comment.“The board is not conducting a search and fully supports our CEO,” said a BNY Mellon spokesman. “Any suggestion to the contrary is completely false.”The board, under the leadership of Mr von Schack, does have form in removing a chief executive — an unusual move in the US where boards are often criticised for being too close to management. In 2011, the board, including Mr Hassell, decided to oust Bob Kelly as chief executive.Reuters said that Mr Fleming had been contacted by Spencer Stuart, whose list of possible candidates also included Michael Cavanagh, co-president of Carlyle, and Mary Erdoes, head of asset management at JPMorgan Chase.Morgan Stanley and Spencer Stuart declined to comment but people familiar with the matter said the recruitment firm had not approached Mr Fleming.The intrigue around BNY Mellon has only grown in the past 12 months. After Trian built its stake, another activist investor, Marcato Capital Management, amassed a 1.6 per cent stake and called explicitly for Mr Hassell to step down.Restive investors are unhappy with the expense levels at the bank. Marcato has attacked targets as “unresponsive, unambitious and uninspiring”. BNY Mellon’s annual meeting is scheduled for next month.
129;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-03-19T22:08:17Z;BNY Mellon to pay $700m over fraud claims;Bank repeatedly misled clients on forex pricing, says US attorney;Bank of New York Mellon on Thursday agreed to pay $714m to settle allegations that it committed fraud by giving customers the worst rates on foreign exchange transactions while promising “best execution”.The settlement comes after a five-year investigation of the largest US custody bank by the US attorney’s office in Manhattan and the New York state attorney-general.BNY Mellon also agreed to “end the employment of certain executives involved in the fraud”, the attorney-general’s office said in a statement, including David Nichols, a managing director. A person familiar with the matter said one other mid-level executive would leave the bank.Last month BNY Mellon restated its earnings to account for the impending charge.“BNYM and its executives, motivated by outsized profits and bonuses, breached this trust and repeatedly misled clients to believe that the pricing they were getting on foreign exchange was far better than it actually was,” said Preet Bharara, the Manhattan US attorney. “The bank repeatedly deceived its customers and is paying a heavy penalty for it.”Eric Schneiderman, New York state attorney-general, said: “Investors count on financial institutions to tell them the truth about how their investments are being managed. But Bank of New York Mellon misled customers and traded at their expense.”Mr Bharara and Mr Schneiderman filed competing lawsuits against BNY Mellon in 2011 but later joined forces.The investigation, which was triggered by a whistleblower, found that BNY Mellon told customers in its “standard instruction FX” programme that the bank would obtain the “best rates” available. Instead it obtained the best rates for itself but gave customers “the worst or close to the worst rates” and pocketed the difference, the prosecutors said.The settlement document said BNY Mellon gave customers “near the worst interbank rates reported during the trading day or session”. Though it admitted wrongdoing in the settlement, BNY Mellon had originally argued that its clients had benefited from cheap interbank rates that were not otherwise available to them.The bank said: “We are pleased to put these legacy FX matters behind us, which is in the best interest of our company and our constituents. We continue to improve our product offerings to ensure they are meeting client demand and positioning clients to succeed in an increasingly complex financial environment.”BNYM and its executives, motivated by outsized profits and bonuses, breached this trust and repeatedly misled clients to believe that the pricing they were getting on foreign exchange was far better than it actually wasThursday’s settlement is separate to the broader probe of currency trading that has ensnared the world’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.In those cases, the justice department, New York’s Department of Financial Services and other authorities are investigating potential manipulation of the foreign exchange markets.Prosecutors in the forex cases have threatened to tear up deferred prosecution agreements or non-prosecution agreements, reached with banks including HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS over previous allegations.“Where a bank that violates a DPA or NPA is a repeat offender with a history of misconduct, or where a violating bank fails to co-operate with an investigation or drags its feet, that bank will face criminal consequences for its breach of the agreement,” assistant attorney-general Leslie Caldwell said this week.The first DoJ settlements in the forex probe are expected this spring, although the timing is still fluid.A lawyer for Mr Nichols declined to comment.
130;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-02-26T18:10:40Z;Revisionists take heat off US bank results;Morgan Stanley’s fourth change to earnings in five quarters follows a pattern on Wall Street;"US banks’ habit of revising earnings weeks after announcing them is driving some analysts to distraction.Last week BNY Mellon announced a $600m hit to its previously disclosed fourth-quarter earnings; last autumn Citigroup and Bank of America were among banks making similar adjustments to reported earnings.Morgan Stanley has done this a lot. The bank’s after-market announcement on Wednesday of a $2.6bn hit from a Department of Justice case, just over a month after it reported quarterly profits, was the fourth time in five quarters that the bank has revised earnings, according to Bloomberg.To some analysts, a revision can seem like a way of allowing companies to hit their earnings targets, then own up to an effective miss a little later.“Putting it in the past makes the offence look more discreet,” said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It removes an overhang, and makes the next quarter look a bit cleaner.”Morgan Stanley’s latest charge — connected to claims it mis-sold mortgage-backed securities — meant that its earnings per share for 2014 dropped by $1.35, according to the firm’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, wiping out more than half of core earnings for the year and slicing about 4 per cent from its book value.The bank apparently made no provision for the settlement in the fourth quarter, despite telling investors in its third quarter 10-Q filing that some legal matters were “in advanced stages”.“Something of this magnitude is rather unusual,” said Joshua Ronen, professor of accounting at New York University Stern School of Business and co-editor of the Journal of Law, Finance and Accounting.Yet the market was unmoved on Thursday morning. The company’s 10-year bond yield shifted about 2 basis points higher — in line with Goldman Sachs and one point more than other big diversified banks. Its shares were slightly weaker than peers, but have traded in line with the sector over the past week.US bank assets, then and nowContinue readingTreating settlements as exceptional means that investors are more likely to see them as a one-off hit, said Paul Gulberg, an analyst at Portales Partners in New York, rather than part of the ordinary course of business for banks in the years after the financial crisis.“Investors know that this mortgage-related issue is a huge one, and the banks will have to pay sooner or later,” he said. “But once this thing is basically put behind them, even if the settlement is higher than some expect, investors seem to kind of not pay attention to it. They kind of look at it in their rear-view mirror, saying this is done, this is the end of it.”Analysts note that Morgan Stanley and its peers are playing by the rules. Under US GAAP, earnings are not final until companies file a 10-Q quarterly report or a 10-K annual report with the SEC. Any “recognised subsequent event” that happens in the window between closing the books and making that filing — a maximum 30 days for a 10-Q and 60 for a 10-K — has to be taken in that quarter.“The timing of recent legal settlements is not something that we control,” Morgan Stanley said in a statement. “Our 10-Q’s and 10-K’s must always reflect any significant subsequent events that have occurred since the close of the quarter.”The timing of recent legal settlements is not something that we controlA revision is not the same as a restatement, which is an admission that the company got it wrong the first time. Rather, it can mean that an running issue affecting earnings reaches a threshold of certainty. In the jargon used by BNY Mellon, losses connected to a separate DoJ probe had become “probable and reasonably estimable”.Many analysts like what Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman has done over the past few years, emphasising annuity-like sources of revenue such as asset management.But they don’t like the annuity-like revisions.“Major earnings revisions undermine credibility,” said Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings.Additional reporting by Gina Chon"
131;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-02-17T23:54:43Z;BNY Mellon restates profits with $598m charge;New provision suggests bank is heading for forex settlement;Bank of New York Mellon has restated the fourth-quarter results it announced last month, taking a $598m litigation charge that suggests it is heading towards a settlement of cases including a three-year-old foreign exchange suit filed by the Department of Justice.The world’s biggest custody bank announced the restatement after the market closed on Tuesday, saying that it had done so because it was now more confident that an end to “several” previously disclosed matters, including the DoJ probe, was in sight.It said losses associated with proceedings were now “probable and reasonably estimable”.The adjustment has the effect of cutting net income for the year by about a fifth, to $2.5bn. Quarterly profits fall from $807m to $209m.Under US accounting rules, if anything occurs between a company announcing quarterly earnings and making its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it must adjust the prior quarter.The charge comes as more banks emerge from a litany of disputes that have caused them large losses in the years since the financial crisis. Last October, Citigroup restated its third-quarter earnings to take account of $600m of additional legal charges connected to alleged forex manipulation, followed a month later by Bank of America, which disclosed a hit of $400m.Other big global banks including HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS disclosed legal reserves related to forex probes during their quarterly earnings releases.The DoJ case against BNYMellon focuses on pricing of forex services for its custody clients. The bank’s disclosure suggests that a settlement could be looming with the DoJ, which has been investigating the $5.3tn-a-day global forex market since 2011.Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks, a Memphis-based broker-dealer, said that investors were unlikely to react badly to the restatement, as the bank is still comfortably in the black for 2014 and there is now more clarity on the outcome of lawsuits.“One of those boxes of uncertainty is now being checked off,” he said.Three weeks ago, BNYMellon’s adjusted earnings of 57 cents a share for the fourth quarter missed analysts’ expectations of 58 cents a share, sending the bank’s shares down almost 5 per cent.The shares have fallen almost 3 per cent this year, compared with a 1.2 per cent gain for the sector.
132;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Boston Company dumps oil for healthcare sector;US Opportunities strategist says economic recovery is ‘a marathon not a sprint’;Efforts by the Boston Company to spruce up its US Opportunities fund have so far proved counterproductive.Last February, the Massachusetts-based BNY Mellon subsidiary revamped the fund’s approach from targeting the biggest companies on the US stock market to a broader focus, which includes investing in smaller shares.But George Saffaye, senior strategist on the fund, said the move hindered the portfolio last year, as larger companies put in the best performance overall.“Our broader exposure proved to be a bit of a headwind when large-cap equities outperformed,” he said.The £103m UK-based fund, which launched in 1986, returned just 13.5 per cent in 2014 as the wider S&P 500 index rose 25.7 per cent, according to data from FE Analytics.Mr Saffaye said he remained confident in the portfolio’s prospects for the year ahead. He pointed out that the fund had also reduced its exposure to energy stocks, which have suffered amid the recent oil price slump.That sell-off began in mid-2014 as the oil price first showed signs of decline. The energy shares were sold off entirely by the end of the year. At the start of 2014 the fund had 6-7 per cent in energy stocks.“Valuations [in oil-related stocks] have to come in,” Mr Saffaye said.“Right now, companies are still pricing oil in at $90 per barrel. That is going to have to change.”Brent crude oil prices dipped below $50 per barrel earlier this year — a figure less than half the $115 per barrel price seen last June.There is doubt over the future of the commodity’s price, with some warning it could dip to below $40 per barrel and remain low for years to come. Others, however, believe it might recover to remain closer to $90 in future.The team redirected the cash proceeds of the energy-stock sales into purchases in the healthcare sector as part of its judgment that innovation in areas such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology would lead to compelling growth.The fund’s healthcare weighting was 18 per cent at the end of last year, according to the latest available data.Mr Saffaye said the fund was positioned with the view that a full return to economic growth remained a distant prospect.“We are out of the recession cycle and the gross domestic product rate has accelerated, but it is a marathon not a sprint,” he said. “Recovery is about one or two years away.”Kathleen Gallagher is a reporter at Investment Adviser
133;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;London misses out on record year for foreign raisings;UK market for depositary receipts hurt by Russia crisis as US dominates $40bn global trade;The number of companies raising capital in London through global depositary receipts (GDRs) last year was the lowest for more than a decade, even though the total depositary receipt market was buoyant.Some bankers doubt that the City will readily see a significant uptick in the use of this financial structure, which enables a company to attract overseas investors without the expense and regulatory burden of a premium listing.According to data from Dealogic, just three groups issued GDRs in London in 2014, raising $1.35bn between them. The most significant of these was Lenta, the Russian hypermarket chain that raised $950m in February.Back in the heyday of 2006, 35 companies used GDRs in London to raise $19.5bn. This represented more than half of the total $35.4bn raised that year, with one-third of the companies listing through depositary receipts.In contrast to London’s decline, the use of American depository receipts (ADRs), used by foreign companies listing in the US, had a strong year. The highest total this century — $35.82bn — was raised by 45 groups as the market continued to rebound from the relatively weaker performance in 2012.Within the global record $39.65bn raised by 56 companies, the US exchanges were more dominant than in the previous couple of years.Anthony Moro, head of the Emea depositary receipts programme at BNY Mellon, said one factor in the US resurgence was the appeal of its market to Chinese tech companies.Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce group, raised $25bn on the New York Stock Exchange in September, in the biggest flotation of the year.“The US is still the single greatest concentration of retail and institutional investors,” Mr Moro said. The bank’s research shows that 24 Chinese companies issued ADRs last year, raising $33bn.He added that the 2012 Jobs Act, which reduced some reporting requirements for foreign companies, had contributed to renewed interest in ADRs, not just from Asian companies but from European companies such as French advertising group Criteo and UK-based GW Pharmaceuticals.He said London had traditionally been the chosen destination for companies from European emerging markets, of which Russia was the most important, but the market had effectively closed to capital raising. Russia’s economy has been hit by western sanctions and sliding oil prices.Another banker cited the fall in commodity prices as a cause of the decline of GDRs in London, since many of the groups turning to the City had been natural resources companies.“These are global factors, not a function of GDRs in themselves,” he said.He added that there were not that many companies suitable for GDRs among European emerging markets, and that groups that were big enough might be more likely to list domestically as their home exchanges achieved critical mass and greater liquidity.

135;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-01-23T16:42:15Z;BNYM eyes higher charges on big deposits;Bank looks to offset rising cost of negative interest rates in Europe;Bank of New York Mellon is considering higher charges for customers who deposit large amounts of money in the latest example of big banks seeking to offset the rising cost of negative interest rates in parts of Europe.Policy makers at the European Central Bank cut deposit rates to below zero last year in an effort to encourage investors to move their cash out of bank accounts and into riskier assets such as stocks and bonds.Such negative interest rates should in theory help revive economic activity, but deposit rates of below zero also mean that financial institutions effectively pay to park their money at central banks, reducing their earnings and making it difficult for them to increase their capital ratios.To offset the cost, banks including BNYM, State Street, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are charging customers for certain “excess deposits”. Charges on deposits look set to increase as Europe’s policy makers embark on further monetary stimulus.“Six months ago it was a little bit surprising to hear how many global banks were beginning to charge for deposits — period. Now it seems like it’s been accelerating,” said Jim Shanahan, financial services analyst for Edward Jones.The Swiss National Bank reduced its deposit rate to negative 0.25 per cent last month and then cut it further to minus 0.75 per cent last week. Denmark’s central bank slashed its rate to negative 0.35 per cent days later.“We have what I would call an unnatural level of deposits reflecting the monetary policy that has taken place over the past few years,” Todd Gibbons, chief financial officer at BNYM, the world’s biggest custody bank, said in an interview.“If interest rates don’t come up and we don’t think we are getting an adequate return on our balance sheet then we would probably take some additional actions.”The threat of higher fees for excess deposits comes as BNYM unveiled fourth-quarter earnings. Net income for the three months to December 31 rose 57 per cent to $807m thanks to higher fee revenue.Adjusted earnings of 57 cents a share nevertheless missed analyst expectations of 58 cents a share, sending BNYM stock down 4.70 per cent by the close in New York.Years of low interest rates have eaten into the profits custody banks can make from safeguarding trillions of dollars worth of customers’ assets, prompting custodian firms such as BNYM to cut costs and explore new types of business.BNYM has also come under additional pressure after Trian Partners, the hedge fund run by activist investor Nelson Peltz, took a $1bn stake in the company. Trian co-founder Ed Garden has since taken a board seat at the custody bank.Mr Gibbons said he was hopeful that the €1.1tn of asset purchases announced by the ECB on Thursday would encourage the kind of investor activity that would boost the bank’s profits.“The bad side is if everybody just buys US Treasury bonds,” he said. “The good side is if everybody puts the money to work and we get a vibrant capital market again. That would be good for us.”
136;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-01-22T11:08:05Z;Poland draws big banks for ‘nearsourcing’;Multinational companies build up a back-office presence closer to home in EU backyard;With its quaint 13th-century market square, meandering canals and botanical gardens, Wroclaw bears little resemblance to the glass and steel-clad banking districts of London, New York or Frankfurt.But the western Polish city is emerging as one of Europe’s most important financial hubs as investment pours in to the country’s outsourcing industry. Poland is beginning to challenge India as the financial services industry’s preferred location for back-office functions.Credit Suisse, UBS and BNY Mellon are planning to add 3,000 workers to their Polish operations over the course of 18 months, according to two people briefed on the banks’ plans.Thousands more back-office roles are forecast to be created in the EU’s sixth-largest economy as their global banking rivals follow suit. Last May, Poland’s Association of Business Service Leaders estimated that employee numbers in the business services sector could rise by a third in just 20 months, to reach 170,000 by the end of 2015.“This year, we will add 15,000 to 20,000 new jobs in this sector,” says Jacek Levernes, ABSL president, “and roughly 5,000 will come from the financial industry”. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment on their exact hiring plans, but BNY Mellon confirmed it is planning a headcount increase of 450 in Poland.This increased investment from western companies has helped Poland become the world’s third-largest outsourcing market after China and India — seeing off competition from Brazil and the Philippines.Already, Royal Dutch Shell runs more than $1tn of cash transactions each year through its offices in Krakow in southern Poland. Similarly, Procter & Gamble runs its entire logistics and supply chain operation for Europe out of Warsaw. The capital city is also the base for Citigroup’s global anti-money laundering operation.For western companies, the attraction of outsourcing to Poland is the chance to cut costs without cutting expertise.170,000Estimate of workforce by the end of 2015Banks, law firms and multinational conglomerates that two decades ago realised the huge cost savings to be made by moving call centres to India now want their outsourcing operations to carry out more complex tasks — and see the advantages of locating them closer to their western headquarters.By doing so, companies can continue to operate under the EU’s legal and regulatory framework, and their executives in London and other capitals can reach their outsourced operations in two hours if things go wrong. Delhi, by contrast, is a nine-hour flight away.In fact, as more western companies have chosen Poland and other eastern European countries as outsourcing destinations, they have renamed the practice “nearsourcing”.“There are certain things that you cannot offshore to places like India,” argues Mr Levernes. “The people that you need are easier to find and overall cost the same as in places like India over the long run.”Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, is also taking advantage of Poland’s competitive labour costs as it continues to face pay disputes in Germany. The US company opened three fulfilment centres near the border in Western Poland — despite not having a retail presence in the country.Continue readingAdvocates of nearshoring contend that young Poles are better educated, boast more professional skills and have a wider European language proficiency than their Asian rivals — but are still much cheaper to employ than university graduates in Germany, the UK or the US.“It is actually more expensive to set up a team that can, say, speak 10 different languages and handle complex projects in Bangalore or Gurgaon than Wroclaw or Kracow,” says Mr Levernes.Demand for Polish back-office staff has accelerated since the financial crisis and enabled the country’s outsourcing industry to grow by an average of 20 per cent a year for the past five years, according to ABSL.“This is the biggest and most exciting industry in eastern Europe,” said Hadley Dean, managing partner for eastern Europe at Colliers International, the real estate firm.Almost half of all the foreign investments in Poland’s outsourcing industry has come from banks, insurance and technology companies — and 90 per cent of all outsourced operations serve western European customers. English and German are the most commonly spoken languages, ABSL says.Much of the investment has been in Poland’s second- and third-tier cities. Lodz, once a thriving textiles producer that fell into rapid decline after the fall of communism, now is home to Accenture, Hewlett-Packard and even India’s own outsourcer Infosys. Between them, the three employ thousands.Simple tasks may well be going to India, but complex business is coming to CEE, and Poland especiallySkanska, a Swedish construction and property development company, says 90 per cent of its business in Poland outside of Warsaw involves buildings for outsourced operations.In the centre of Wroclaw, which is close to the Czech Republic, workers are completing work on the Dominikanski, the largest office building in southwest Poland.More than 85 per cent of the space will be taken by outsourcing operations when it opens its doors and its biggest tenant will be Hewlett-Packard, which employs more than 4,000 people in Poland.“We can see more growth is coming from the clients that are already operating in Poland, as they look to scale up and consolidate their operations,” says Arkadiusz Rudzki, leasing and asset director at Skanska, which is managing the Dominikanski building project. “Simple tasks may well be going to India, but complex business is coming to CEE, and Poland especially.”

The minority shareholders will each have 4.9 per cent, with the remaining 60 per cent held by Fidelity.Details are still being ironed out with regulators in the US, with the launch expected in the second half of the year.The fragmentation of equity trading across 13 public stock exchanges and another 50 alternate venues has caused frustration for large buyside firms, even as it has been credited by some with creating competition and lowering costs.Firms have had to expand technology budgets to cope with the emergence of high-frequency traders (HFT), which use algorithms to sniff out when big buyers are in the market and which exploit the complexity of the current system to harvest millions of tiny trading profits.Fidelity in particular has sharply expanded its technology spending to hide its trading intentions so as to avoid giving signals that HFT firms can exploit.The development of Luminex reflects disappointment with other dark pools, many of which were designed to be a safe place for large investors to conduct their biggest trades, but which have increasingly opened up — or been infiltrated by — HFT firms.Explaining the dynamics of the modern US share marketUS regulators have been investigating whether dark pools are always being transparent to clients about the presence of HFT firms. The issue moved up the political agenda last year with the publication of Flash Boys by the author Michael Lewis, who claimed the US equity market was effectively “rigged” in favour of high-frequency firms.Fidelity and other firms involved in Luminex declined to comment.Most large asset managers already “internalise” whatever trades they can, so that funds that want to sell a particular stock are matched with funds that want to add that stock to their portfolios. Luminex would be a platform for combining forces, creating a larger pool of liquidity.Before choosing the name Luminex, Fidelity had codenamed its dark pool “sakura”, after the Japanese word for cherry blossom.
138;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2015-01-18T04:20:26Z;Jon Little: ‘A multi-asset generalist is the kiss of death’;Jon Little, founder of Northill Capital, favours successful but low-profile boutique fund houses;"Until 2010, Jon Little oversaw $400bn of assets as head of BNY Mellon’s international asset management business, with a stable of managers including Insight, Newton and Alcentra.Today he looks after a quintet of fund managers with assets of just $30bn, and whose best-known name is probably Longview Partners, the global equity house.Yet, appropriately, small is beautiful for Mr Little, an avowed advocate for nimble, privately owned, specialist asset managers.“A lot of the big managers have taken on a lot of assets and they are not as nimble as they once were. That is one thing I get passionate about. There is an optimal size for each asset manager,” says Mr Little, who is now a partner at London-based multi-boutique manager Northill Capital.“You are certifiably incompetent if you are unprofitable at $2bn or $3bn [in assets]. It is very hard not to be profitable at $1bn. But if assets bring down your performance, you have lost more in performance fees than you gain in the assets you have raised.“Revenues are vanity, profits are sanity. That comes from the retail world, but it works surprisingly well [in asset management].”Mr Little was poached from BNY Mellon by the Swiss-Italian Bertarelli family, who are among the world’s 100 richest, according to Forbes, the business magazine. It is headed by Ernesto, a two-times winner of sailing’s America’s Cup, and his wife Kirsty, a former Miss UK.The Bertarellis, who made their money from pharmaceuticals, wanted to set up their third asset management house (alongside Kedge Capital, which invests in hedge funds and private equity, and Crosstree Real Estate Partners), possibly because they are aware that there is more money to be made from owning fund managers than investing in their funds.Mr Little jumped ship to pilot Northill, like Kedge and Crosstree named after a type of anchor, and hired a host of his former BNY Mellon colleagues to help run it.Since then they have assembled a roster of five managers. Northill has taken stakes of between 50 and 80 per cent in Securis Investment Partners, a manager of insurance-related assets; Riverbridge Partners, a Minneapolis-based US growth equity boutique; and Longview, a global equity specialist. It also has majority stakes in two start-ups: Goldbridge Capital Partners, a specialist in European subinvestment-grade credit; and Ellis Munro, a Singapore-based long-short value equity house.Mr Little hints at a concern that BNY Mellon, which manages $1.6tn in total and describes itself as “the investment company for the world”, may have expanded too far.“I am pleased to say that the asset management business is doing well; [multi-boutique] is a better model than being an integrated asset manager. Whether I would have grown boutique A or B to that point, I am not sure,” says Mr Little. He says BNY Mellon also has a “cost problem”.“They have been bad in managing their cost base. If they are not successful they will end up splitting off their asset management business because it is worth more than the bank business,” he says.Likewise, Mr Little argues Affiliated Managers Group, a big US-listed multi-boutique with assets of $617bn, is stuck on a hamster wheel of relentless expansion.“AMG has 30 managers in its portfolio. They have to do that. They have a premium [stock market] rating because they are a growth stock. When they stop doing that, they go to a [price-to-earnings ratio] of 13-14 rather than 18-19, so the managers can’t stop. They will lose their premium rating and lose their jobs.”Despite being backed by the Bertarelli billions, Mr Little says Northill will not expand beyond 10 boutiques. It “would be like having 20 children”, given its finite resources and that its partners sit on the boutiques’ boards.Conversations are said to be continuing with houses specialising in timber, farmland and infrastructure, asset classes potentially uncorrelated with the wider markets. Emerging markets and US credit are other holes Northill would like to fill.It is not short of options, having been approached by 168 asset managers last year. But it will not participate in auctions and is wary of outbreaks of “bid fever”. For instance, when Rensburg Fund Management was sold to Franklin Templeton Global Investors in 2011, Mr Little says “the price was so high the rest of the bidders were told to stand down”, with Templeton’s bid double that of its rivals.Mr Little, who is also a non-executive director of Jupiter Fund Management, says there is “comprehensive, solid evidence” that focused specialist houses outperform broader generalists.“We will never invest in an asset manager that is a multi-asset generalist, because we think that is the kiss of death. We would rather invest in people that are consistently closing to new business,” he says.Mr Little believes several asset managers have suffered from spreading their wings too wide.“Aberdeen over the years has been a consistently good Asian and global emerging market manager, yet it has done all its other [M&A] activity. I am not sure all this other activity has made it a better business,” he says. “F&C used to be very good at small-caps. Are they still? Not sure; it is buried under everything else.”“Within a mile of this office [in London’s Mayfair] I can probably think of 10 funds who have, year after year, beaten their benchmark. But they are closed, or they are closed a lot more than they are open.“They are the unsung heroes of asset management. They don’t advertise, they don’t want money, they are not launching new products, so you very rarely see them in the press.”Longview, founded in 2001, is typical of the successful, but low-profile, boutiques Northill favours.“[Their fund] has outperformed for every year bar one, when it modestly underperformed its benchmark. They have been closed for four years out of five and they only take on assets when they are very certain they can manage them.“But they are also incredibly profitable. They don’t have marketing people or advertising or a corporate strategy department. Everyone in the firm is focused on asset management.”As a result, Longview has 37 employees, Mr Little says, and Securis has 40, so “profitability takes care of itself with this number of staff”, given typical fees of 50-60 basis points at Longview and 2 per cent (with a 20 per cent performance fee) at Securis. Riverbridge charges 75bp “on $7bn and we have 24 staff. Do the maths.”——————————————-Born 1964Total pay Not disclosedEducation Business studies, Oxford Brookes UniversityCareer 1991 Head of UK business development, Fidelity Investments1997 Head of international funds distribution, JPMorgan Investment Management2000 Head of global distribution, Mellon Global Investments2003 Chief executive, Mellon Global Investments2007 Chairman, BNY Mellon AM International; chairman, Dreyfus Corporation2009 Vice-chairman, BNY Mellon Asset Management; member, Bank of New York Mellon global executive committee2010 Founder and partner, Northill Capital——————————————-Founded 2010Assets under management roughly $30bn (in which Northill owns a majority interest)Employees 16Offices London, Jersey, New YorkOwnership Partnership; principally backed by interests associated with the Bertarelli family"

Cygnifi, an online derivatives service provider, filed for bankruptcy shortly after being spun out of the bank but other early investments, including the trading platform MarketAxess and PayPal, the payment processing company, went on to make significant profits.One former bank lab employee said: “Not all labs are created equal. They can sort of be play things for corporate executives.”BNYMellon has been under pressure from shareholders, including the activist investor Nelson Peltz, to cut costs and boost profits following six years of ultra-low interest rates that have eaten into the money it can make from safeguarding trillions of dollars worth of client assets.“Software is eating the world,” said Mr Kumar, echoing the famous words of Marc Andreessen, the Netscape founder who is now one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent venture capitalists. “We obviously have a financial institution to run, but at the same time we are also interested in creating great new offerings.”
143;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-11-06T20:30:44Z;UK High Court court wades into Argentina’s debt crisis;Judgment could unlock funds for bondholders who are owed €226m in interest payments;A UK court has waded into Argentina’s debt crisis, giving hope to investors seeking to recover millions of euros in interest payments frozen by US courts.In its first public comments on the case, the High Court in London indicated on Thursday that the payments fell under its domain because the euro-denominated Argentine bonds were issued under English law.If the High Court makes a formal declaration to this effect, it could open the way for Argentina’s creditors – including George Soros’s Quantum Partners and Kyle Bass’s Hayman Capital Management – to receive Argentine funds currently locked in a Bank of New York Mellon trustee account.Those funds have been frozen on the instructions of a New York court, which ordered that the bondholders should not receive payment until the country paid back debt it defaulted on in 2001. The hedge funds, which are owed €226m, have been seeking to challenge this, citing the English law.Christopher Clark, US counsel to the euro bondholders, said he was pleased that the British judge had recognised that the issue of payment was an English law question.Judge Guy Newey of the High Court said he would delay ruling until mid-December in order to give those investors seeking repayment from the 2001 default – which benefited from the New York court’s decision – a chance to challenge. Such holdout investors include NML Capital, a subsidiary of Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital Management.Since Argentina’s latest default in July, triggered by a New York judge’s ruling that holdouts must be paid in full, NML has hunted for Argentine sovereign assets around the world to claim as repayment.The hedge fund has attempted to seize a naval training vessel, among other state assets. It recently sought an emergency court order to prevent Guido Forcieri, an Argentine lawyer and outgoing World Bank representative, from leaving the US in order to answer questions about assets that could potentially be seized.Mr Forcieri is a close associate of Amado Boudou, Argentina’s vice-president, who was indicted in June by an Argentine federal court on corruption charges. These could result in the state confiscating any assets deemed to have been gained by corrupt means if he is found guilty – money that NML could then attempt to claim.Legal experts say another element of NML’s strategy is to put pressure on Argentina to pay by highlighting alleged corruption at the highest levels of government.A new group of holdout investors – referred to by some observers as the “me-toos” – is also beginning to emerge, threatening to complicate the situation further. They have refused to accept the terms of Argentina’s debt restructurings but have not won court orders to be paid in full like NML.The 14 funds that US district judge Thomas Griesa has so far allowed to join NML’s group of holdouts in the negotiations, which include Ken Dart’s EM Ltd, hold claims worth around $1.2bn out of a total of some $10bn of potential claims.
144;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-11-03T20:53:38Z;Argentina’s debt battle arrives in London with High Court appeal;Hedge funds sue trustee BNY Mellon over euro-denominated bonds;A group of investors in Argentine debt are appealing to the UK’s High Court to unfreeze more than €200m deposited by the country in the Bank of New York Mellon.Hedge funds, including Knighthead Master Fund and Quantum Partners, claim that because the euro-denominated bonds they own are governed by English law, they should not be subject to a New York court ruling earlier this year blocking interest payments.The hearing, which began on Monday, refers to a 2012 ruling by US Judge Thomas Griesa, who decided that Argentina could not make payments to investors holding its overseas bonds unless it also paid so-called holdout investors, who rejected bond swaps in 2005 and 2010.After failing to reach an agreement with holdout bondholders Argentina defaulted on its debt this summer, although it has tried to make payments to investors holding its restructured debt.In June, Buenos Aires deposited €225m ($280m) with trustee BNY Mellon for euro-denominated bondholders, but the bank was ordered by New York courts not to make the payments. The funds are currently held in a bank account in Argentina.BNY Mellon, which Argentina has sought to replace as trustee, said it was not required to act in a way that would place it in contempt of the New York court.The case comes days after a group of Italian investors lost their bid to retrieve interest payments made by Argentina and held by BNY Mellon. Behind these claims lies the question of how far US court jurisdiction should reach.Argentina and the holders of its restructured debt have tried to reduce the scope of Judge Griesa’s equal treatment “pari passu” ruling and free up funds that are currently in limbo under several jurisdictions.This month, a US appeals court dismissed Argentina’s appeal of Judge Griesa’s order preventing BNY Mellon from transferring funds to holders of the restructured debt that is not governed by US law.A hearing with Judge Griesa is due on December 9 to consider whether Citigroup should be allowed to process an interest payment Argentina is scheduled to make on December 31 on some of its restructured bonds issued under Argentine law.A federal judge in Argentina also denied a petition this month from investors seeking access to funds frozen in BNY Mellon, and the investors are now awaiting a decision from the court of appeals.There is also a case pending in Belgium, where a group of investors have sued Bank of New York Mellon Brussels and Euroclear Bank in Belgium in an attempt to receive payments. A hearing is expected in 2015.Additional reporting by Jane Croft
145;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-10-26T07:58:07Z;The week: October 27;BNY Mellon launches wealth management initiative in Hong Kong;C Bank of New York Mellon is launching a large wealth management initiative in Hong Kong. It will cater both to Americans abroad whose US-based fund managers may not be familiar with complicated offshore tax regimes and Asian families whose lives encompass multiple jurisdictions.The Asia-Pacific private wealth market is forecast to grow 10.5 per cent annually between 2013 and 2018, to $61tn, overtaking North America. Here private wealth is expected to increase 3.3 per cent a year, to $59.1tn, according to the Boston Consulting Group.C Even as China’s economy has faltered, growing at its slowest pace in more than five years in the third quarter, the stock market has surged. The forthcoming launch of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect programme, which will give international investors unprecedented access to the Shanghai market, has stoked expectations that foreign inflows will lift shares once the pilot programme gets under way.C Hugh Hendry (pictured), one of the UK’s highest-profile hedge fund managers, has haemorrhaged assets from his Eclectica fund, in spite of relatively robust performance compared with his peers.The assets of Eclectica Asset Management, the hedge fund run by Mr Hendry since 2005, have fallen from more than $1bn to $440m in a year as a number of large investors have pulled out their money.Eclectica’s $260m main fund is down 1.3 per cent year to date, outperforming the majority of global macro hedge funds.C Janus Capital warned shareholders last week that its pay bill would rise next year following the arrival of Bill Gross from Pimco.Speculation has grown about how much Mr Gross will be paid at Janus, after he netted a reported $200m per year for overseeing almost $2tn at Pimco.Janus said analysts should not factor in “some giant compensation hit” for Mr Gross and hailed his arrival as a “game changer”.Shareholders will hope so, as the Denver-based manager announced a 19th consecutive quarter of outflows last week, which reduced its total assets to $174.4bn.C Goldman Sachs is in talks to acquire IndexIQ, a small New York-based $1.2bn exchange traded funds provider. IndexIQ was the first manager to launch ETFs that replicate hedge fund strategies, an expertise that would fit well with other sophisticated passive strategies offered by GSAM.
146;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-10-22T06:56:07Z;BNY Mellon launches Asia wealth management strategy;Hong Kong unit joins US banks seeking to expand investment services as new rules squeeze basic banking;Bank of New York Mellon’s Hong Kong unit is launching a major wealth management initiative, joining a host of US-based banks seeking to expand their fee-based investment services at a time when basic banking is being hamstrung by increasingly onerous regulatory requirements.BNY Mellon plans a two-pronged approach, in acknowledgment of the fact that many current and potential clients have multiple national identities and complicated tax needs.On the one hand, it will cater to Americans abroad, whose US-based fund managers may not be familiar with complicated tax regimes offshore. At the same time, it plans to serve Asian families whose lives encompass multiple jurisdictions, for example, a Chinese family with offspring sent to the US for education and an eventual US passport or green card.“Our competitive advantage is that we can deal with global tax issues,” said Alan Harden, BNY Mellon’s head of Investment Management in the region. Many banks prefer to handle their clients from their US offices rather than locally, he added.The move comes amid intensifying competition for Asia-Pacific wealth management. Both Citigroup and JPMorgan have long-established wealth management and private banking business in the region as well as close relationships with many rich local families.Between 2013 and 2018, regional private wealth is expected to grow at 10.5 per cent annually to reach $61tn, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.Last year, Greater China accounted for 64 per cent of total wealth in Asia-Pacific, with China itself accounting for 48 per cent. China is also the fastest growing market in the region, if Australia is excluded.By contrast, North American wealth is expected to increase by 3.3 per cent a year during the period to total $59.1tn by 2018, according to the BCG report.Americans abroad face greater scrutiny in the wake of more stringent tax requirements imposed from home, a big reason many expatriates have chosen to give up their citizenship – the number of people renouncing is up 221 per cent since 2010, according to a recent BNY Mellon study.“Fatca [the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act] has put a lot of pressure on US citizens living abroad,” said Chuck Long, BNY Mellon’s head of wealth for Greater China. The act is aimed at cracking down on tax avoidance by US citizens via assets and accounts held offshore.As many banks and wealth managers have begun to shy away from US citizens, put off by the new regulations that place the reporting burden squarely on financial institutions rather than on individuals, BNY Mellon sees a big opportunity.BNY Mellon, the seventh-largest wealth adviser in the US with $187bn in private client assets, plans to seek out Asia-Pacific clients with a net worth of $3m or more and will expand its wealth staff in the region.The bank, which last week reported an 11 per cent rise in third-quarter profit, has been under pressure to cut costs and improve returns to shareholders including the activist investor Nelson Peltz.It has already received regulatory approvals for its local service in Hong Kong, which will be formally announced on Thursday.
147;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-10-17T15:25:27Z;BNY Mellon charges clients for euro deposits;US bank tries to offset negative rates on European business;Bank of New York Mellon has begun charging clients for depositing euros as the world’s biggest custody bank seeks to offset the effect of negative interest rates on its business in Europe.The move underscores a growing disparity between the monetary policies of the eurozone, where the central bank has embarked on additional stimulus, and the US, where the Federal Reserve has begun “tapering” its asset purchases.That disparity was in full view in global markets this week, as concerns that a stronger US dollar relative to the euro could leave America exposed to deflationary risks helped spark a dramatic sell-off in stocks and bonds on Wall Street.In Europe, the European Central Bank’s recent decision to push its deposit rate below zero is expected to affect more than €500bn of money market fund balances, as the central bank attempts to boost the eurozone economy.About 15 per cent of BNY Mellon’s deposits are in euros and the custodian bank began charging clients to hold such deposits at the start of this month.“What we are doing is essentially passing through the 20 basis point fee that we are absorbing from the European Central Bank,” Brian Shea, BNYMellon vice-chairman, said on a conference call. “Clients understand that we are actually not initiating this but actually passing through the fee that we are absorbing.”When asked whether the ECB’s negative rates seemed to be working in terms of forcing investors out of safe deposits and into riskier investments, Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon’s chief financial officer, said in an interview that: “We have seen a little bit of [deposit] run-off since the negative rate.”Other banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are also said to have begun charging clients, according to people familiar with the matter. Spokespeople for both banks declined to comment.Mr Gibbons declined to say whether the bank had seen deposit inflows as a result of this week’s sell-off, which generally saw investors shift out of risky positions and into safer options like cash and US Treasuries.Custodian banks such as BNY Mellon have been hit by more than five years of ultra-low interest rates as their bread-and-butter business of safeguarding trillions of dollars worth of client assets has become less profitable.On Friday, BNY Mellon said that its third-quarter profits rose 11 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier to $1.07bn, or 93 cents a share.Excluding certain one-off items, such as expenses tied to job cuts, the bank earned 64 cents a share – higher than the 61 cents forecast by analysts.The company has been under pressure to cut costs and boost flagging returns to shareholders including the activist investor Nelson Peltz.It has trimmed expenses this year by agreeing to sell its headquarters in downtown Manhattan and closing its derivatives sales and trading team in the face of new regulation that makes the business more expensive.Total non-interest expenses slipped a third of a percentage point in the quarter.Jim Shanahan, analyst at Edward Jones, said: “Bank of New York Mellon is in a tough spot here because it’s going to be very difficult for them to achieve growth without stronger pricing, more robust flows and higher interest rates.”
148;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-09-30T09:19:41Z;US court holds Argentina in contempt over bond payment plans;Judge says Buenos Aires took ‘illegal’ steps to avoid orders on debt case;Argentina’s holdout creditors won a symbolic victory on Monday night after a US judge found the country in contempt of court for taking “illegal” steps to avoid his orders.US District Judge Thomas Griesa said Buenos Aires’s steps to replace Bank of New York Mellon as the trustee for its restructured sovereign debt with local state-owned bank, Banco de la Nacion Fideicomiso, are “illegal and cannot be carried out”.Nonetheless, sources at Argentina’s central bank told Reuters that the country still planned to make a $200m payment on Tuesday to holders of its restructured bonds, in continued defiance of Judge Griesa’s orders.Hector Timmerman, the Argentine foreign minister, said the court ruling was a “violation of international law.”Argentina missed a July bond payment to holders of its restructured sovereign bonds after Judge Griesa ruled it could not be made unless Argentina also paid the holdout creditors in full on their defaulted debt. Argentina deposited $539m with BNY Mellon, but the bank, in compliance with Judge Griesa’s orders, did not pass it on to restructured bond holdersArgentina says it cannot pay the holdouts, led by NML Capital, a subsidiary of hedge fund Elliott Management, as doing so would trigger the so-called RUFO clause that forbids the sovereign to offer better terms to holders of its restructured bonds. The clause expires at the end of this year.Argentina’s debt restructuring was obstructed by a small minority of bond holders demanding full repayment. Will a debt industry initiative to end such holdouts work?A contempt of court ruling on a sovereign government is rare but an not unprecedented move. Roberto Cohen, the lawyer for NML Associates which is leading the case, was quoted by the leading Argentine daily La Nación as saying: “We don’t believe it [the ruling] will make matters worse as it is hard to imagine how the situation could get worse.”The holdouts have asked Judge Griesa to impose a daily fine of $50,000 – although Argentina could simply ignore that sanction, Mr Cohen acknowledged. Other steps potentially include barring Argentina from doing any business with US banks, although that could engender fresh litigation over whether Judge Griesa has the authority to do so.Judge Griesa did not set a specific date to consider sanctions.

150;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-09-26T09:26:01Z;Quick View: FX industry gets organised;Forex industry fights back with its own lobby group;"It’s the world’s biggest, most liquid and most accessible market and is closely watched by governments and central banks alike. Yet now the foreign exchange market also feels the need for a lobby group to look out for its interests.Yesterday saw the launch of the Foreign Exchange Professionals Association (FXPA), which aims “to engage key US and international regulators, policy makers, the general public and news media” in a range of industry issues.Impressively, it has wide cross-industry support, with founder members from banks (Bank of New York Mellon), institutional investors (CALPERS), infrastructure providers (CME Group, LCH.Clearnet, LMAX Exchange, Traiana) and market middlemen (GFI Group, Virtu Financial and Citadel).Adam Cooper, chief legal officer at Citadel, is chairman and Derek Sammann, global head of commodity and options products at CME Group, will be the vice chair.But before we add it to the growing pile of industry interest groups, it is worth considering why it has come into being.There are clear parallels here. This is exactly what the world’s big electronic market makers and high-frequency traders did only a few years ago. In remarkably short time the new boys had upset the old world order, shaken up the system, taken much of its business . . . and then came the Flash Crash of 2010.Faced with popular hostility and regulatory scrutiny, under the auspices of the Futures Industry Association it created the Principal Traders Group and a European counterpart. Its role has been twofold; explain the industry and in doing so, head off some populist legislation, especially in Europe.Clearly, there is deep concern about the long-term outcome of the global regulatory investigation into whether some traders attempted to manipulate the WM/Reuters rates during the critical period when benchmarks are fixed. Already there have been some calls for a global FX platform.But the creation of this lobby group underlines a deeper point. Mr Sammann put his finger on it by saying: “This is a watershed moment for FX as we redefine who we are as an industry and where we’re going.” He went on: “We can more strongly represent the voice of the FX industry to positively impact the coming market structure changes resulting from unfolding market regulations, capital changes and client product choice.”For a long time the FX industry has considered itself a world apart, contributing to its characterisation as something of a barely-regulated “wild west”. Post-crisis, that is coming to an end.Already, foreign exchange futures and options are becoming a more popular way to trade and those trades will have to be cleared. Yet regulators appear to be very uncertain how to proceed. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission long ago produced its final rules for clearing interest rates and credit products yet FX is still to come; Europe is bogged down in a mind-numbing discussion over what constitutes a derivative. As FXPA noted, there are also risk controls and post-trade reporting rules to implement.This week in London the International Swaps and Derivatives Association talked openly about its plans to head off potential chaos by creating a single industry model to calculate initial margin for uncleared trades.Some of Isda’s previous efforts include tidying up large parts of the credit default swaps market, tearing up overlapping contracts and netting exposures and revisiting its definitions of a default.Lobbyists, yes, but also an example that a trade group can be a galvanising point for a more practical, efficient – and hopefully safer – market."
151;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
152;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-09-25T14:56:23Z;Argentina tries to pay debt outside US;Government wants to replace BNY Mellon as bond trustee;In its latest attempt to circumvent US courts, Argentina will seek to pay nearly $200m due on its restructured bonds by disbursing the money to investors next week via a local bank instead of Bank of New York Mellon, its trustee.In response, holders of the country’s defaulted bonds have asked US District Judge Thomas Griesa to find the nation in contempt of court and fine it $50,000 for seeking to evade legal rulings that require Argentina to pay them in full if it also services its restructured debt.“Argentina has blatantly and repeatedly violated the court’s orders, making it abundantly clear that it has no respect for those orders, the court or the US judicial system,” the holdout creditors, led by hedge fund NML Capital, a subsidiary of billionaire investor Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, said in a Manhattan court filing on Wednesday.Argentina was forced into default on its performing debt on July 30 after BNY Mellon, complying with US court orders, refused to pass on to bondholders a $539m payment. This week, Argentina took out full page adverts in the Financial Times and Washington Post asking BNY Mellon to resign as trustee, saying it was no longer “eligible”.According to people familiar with Buenos Aires’ strategy, Argentina may replace BNY Mellon and turn instead to Nación Fideicomisos, a fiduciary agent affiliated with Grupo Nación, the country’s largest state bank. The almost $200M deposit is expected ahead of a September 30 payment deadline. Officials at Fideicomisos were not available for comment.Argentina’s plan to switch trustees “won’t work,” warned Alejo Costa, head of strategy at Puente, an investment bank in Buenos Aires. “The way things are right now, this is just going to work as an escrow account, not as a payment.”One problem Mr Costa identified is that it will not be possible for Fideicomisos to distribute the funds as it will be unable to identify the bondholders without the co-operation of BNY Mellon. Argentina’s central bank last month revoked BNY Mellon’s authorisation to operate an office in the country.Ultimately, all the back and forth with these bonds has become a big distraction. Argentina’s economy has bigger problems to address“BNY Mellon remains eligible to serve as Trustee,” the bank said in a statement. The bank “will continue to comply with binding court orders that govern its actions as Trustee in this matter.”Separately, Buenos Aires is also threatening Citigroup’s Argentina branch with civil and criminal liability if it fails to make payments on another group of dollar-denominated bonds, worth about $8.4bn.Citigroup has requested Judge Griesa to allow it to proceed with the payments on the local law debt, also due on September 30. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for September 26. Judge Griesa has also set September 29 for a court hearing on the holdout creditors’ request to declare Argentina in contempt of court.Regardless of the outcomes, analysts say the tit-for-tat dispute over the payment mechanisms does little to help the country solve its broader economic challenges, such as a recession and rising inflation.“Ultimately, all the back and forth with these bonds has become a big distraction,” said Gabriel Torres, a senior Latin America sovereign analyst for Moody’s. “Argentina’s economy has bigger problems to address.”
153;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-09-03T14:49:37Z;Global giants head for court in Argentine assets wrangle;;The so-called “sovereign debt trial of the century” between Argentina and its holdout creditors came to an end earlier this year, triggering the country’s second default in 13 years, but a dizzying array of fresh legal complications is still emerging.A new round of legal wrangling is setting up confrontations between giants of global finance. Creditors, including financier George Soros, are resorting to courts in New York, London and Buenos Aires to obtain payment on Argentine bonds that has been stymied thanks to an earlier legal victory by the holdout hedge funds, led by billionaire Paul Singer.Meanwhile, faced with Argentina’s refusal to comply with New York Judge Thomas Griesa’s order to pay the holdouts, Mr Singer and his associates are scouring the globe for sovereign assets to embargo. Last week, they demanded information about Argentina’s multibillion-dollar deals with China, and even how President Cristina Fernández’s 24-year-old daughter, Florencia, paid for a film studies course in New York.In Argentina, the senate is this week debating legislation that could enable bondholders to seek payment outside the US, after Judge Griesa’s ruling – that Argentina must pay the holdouts in full at the same time as it pays the rest of its creditors who accepted debt restructurings after the 2001 default – was upheld by the US Supreme Court in June.Marco Schnabl, an Argentine lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, has “serious reservations” about whether a meaningful number of bondholders will take up the government’s proposed offer of exchanging existing bonds issued mostly under US and UK law for new bonds governed by Argentine or French law.“It doesn’t matter where the venue [of payment] is. It could be in the fifth moon of Saturn, but the question still remains, how do you identify who the beneficial bondholders are?” asked Mr Schnabl.Mr Schnabl also pointed out that bond registries are subject to Judge Griesa’s order, and risk being held in contempt of court – together with Argentina – for helping the country to evade his orders.Investors who do not participate in the swap could instead choose to “accelerate” their bonds, demanding immediate payment. But since Argentina does not have enough foreign currency to pay outright, this could lead to another debt restructuring.“We could see one set of holdout problems turn into multiple holdout problems, with Argentina facing a whole fresh set of legal challenges,” says Tim Samples, a professor of legal studies at the University of Georgia.Mr Samples adds that yet another set of liabilities could arise if Judge Griesa decides that his injunction does not apply to bondholders with debt that is subject to jurisdictions outside the US. A successful appeal of his ruling, with a key hearing on September 18, could see bondholders that manage to be paid facing lawsuits from holders of bonds still in default, he says.“Anyone with Argentina’s money is subject to lawsuits, because you have a lot of creative and innovative parties going after that cash,” said Mr Samples.That includes the $539m that Argentina deposited at Bank of New York Mellon which Judge Griesa prevented from being transferred to bondholders, so triggering the default. “BNY is holding a very hot potato right now. I bet they’re wishing Argentina hadn’t deposited that money,” said Mr Samples.The holdouts are also targeting assets owned by state oil company YPF and Lázaro Báez, a business associate of Ms Fernández, with 123 shell companies under investigation by a Nevada judge who suspects fraud. Nevertheless, Eugenio Bruno, an Argentine lawyer specialising in sovereign debt, says it is unlikely that the holdouts’ asset hunting will lead to significant payouts, and is more intended to be “politically embarrassing” for the government.For Argentina to be able to pay all of its creditors freely, it will have to reach a deal with the holdouts, says Mr Bruno. But few expect a settlement until at least the end of the year, and possibly not until a new administration takes power after presidential elections in October 2015.Mr Bruno observed that it took Argentina three years to implement the first of two debt restructurings after the 2001 default. “There is always a disorderly situation after this kind of credit event, and this one could last from a matter of months to a couple of years,” he said.
154;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Argentina retaliates against BNY over debt payments;;Argentina retaliated against Bank of New York Mellon on Monday for refusing to make payments to bondholders in compliance with a US court ruling – a move which has also led a group of hedge funds that includes George Soros’ Quantum Partners to sue the US bank.The move by Buenos Aires, which cancels the licences of two local bank officials, follows a proposal sent to congress last week by President Cristina Fernández that aims to replace BNY Mellon as its trustee with a local state-run bank. BNY Mellon’s refusal to distribute the funds last month triggered Argentina’s second default in 13 years.BNY Mellon has been caught in the crossfire of an acrimonious dispute between Argentina and so-called holdout creditors, led by US billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management. New York’s Judge Thomas Griesa ruled two years ago that the South American nation could not pay the holders of defaulted debt it restructured in 2005 and 2010 without also paying the holdouts.BNY Mellon has said it will comply with US court orders, but as a trustee it also has a responsibility to dispense payments from Argentina to investors.A lawsuit filed in London last week by a group of hedge funds, including George Soros’ Quantum Partners and Hayman Capital Management, said BNY Mellon is “failing” its duties to holders of Argentine bonds by refusing to distribute €226m ($298m) of interest on Argentine debt.The group of hedge funds holds a combined €1.3bn of debt securities, or 11 per cent of euro-denominated restructured Argentine bonds.Ron Gruendl, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, said the suit “is without merit,” but declined to comment further on the case.BNY Mellon has considered stepping down as trustee for the Argentine bonds but can only do so if it is able to find a replacement, people familiar with its thinking said. No other banks have yet offered to take over as trustee for the disputed debt.Argentina’s government has called on BNY Mellon and Citibank – which is also a custodian for some Argentine bonds – to “distribute payments made by the Argentine Republic to exchange bondholders.”Analysts said the developments are just the beginning of a flood of legal disputes and complications triggered by Argentina’s default, as creditors seek payment through diverse methods.As well as the bondholders suing BNY Mellon, other creditors are seeking to appeal New York Judge Thomas Griesa’s ruling that prevents the bank from making the payments.Meanwhile, the holdouts are seeking to seize Argentine sovereign assets, most recently in Nevada, after the government refused to pay them in full despite Judge Griesa’s order that it must do so.Argentina is also in danger of being declared in contempt of court by Judge Griesa if the plan being debated in congress goes ahead, since it could lead to a change in the jurisdiction of its debt that would circumvent the judge’s ruling.This story has been amended to clarify that the government revoked BNY Mellon’s authorisation to operate a representative office, not a bank.
155;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-08-20T03:57:10Z;Argentina proposes voluntary debt swap;;Argentina’s President Cristina Fernández announced plans on Tuesday to launch a voluntary debt swap aimed at dodging a US court ruling that last month triggered the country’s second default in less than 13 years.The government is seeking approval from congress for plans that would enable it to service debt in Argentina as well as allow bondholders to exchange their debt issued under foreign law for bonds of the same value governed by local law.Ms Fernández said Argentina would stop using Bank of New York Mellon as a trustee and instead make payments on its bonds via an account at Banco de la Nación in Buenos Aires, after the default was caused by a US judge preventing BNY Mellon from transferring $539m to bondholders.The US Supreme Court upheld the judge’s ruling that Argentina must pay its so-called holdout creditors in full at the same time as paying the rest of its bondholders, who accepted a 65 per cent haircut on their bonds after a 2001 default.The announcement put an end to speculation that a deal might be reached with the holdouts, after negotiations with the government collapsed at the end of July. Subsequently, a group of Wall Street banks were understood to be negotiating to buy the holdouts’ defaulted debt at a discount and sell it to the government later.The swap will be voluntary and the government will also deposit funds for the holdouts in a show of “good faith” under the terms of the 2010 debt restructuring, Ms Fernández said.“If I were to sign what many would like me to sign, no doubt some would applaud this, but the bomb would explode later,” Ms Fernández said, referring to the government’s failure to reach an agreement with the holdouts, which it had warned could trigger serious legal liabilities.“I have little time left as president, so this is not for this government but for the next one,” she added in a pre-recorded speech aired on nationwide television at 9pm on Tuesday evening.On the verge of tears, admitting that she was “nervous”, Ms Fernández urged opposition politicians to back the bill she was sending to congress.The president said Argentina’s debt was accumulated by previous governments and that her predecessor and late husband, Néstor Kirchner, was the first president to start reducing the national debt after decades of increasing indebtedness.Her announcement raised many unanswered questions over what would happen if bondholders chose not to swap their debt for local-law bonds, or if they refused to accept Banco de la Nación as a fiduciary agent.
156;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-08-06T18:05:35Z;Argentina: Unresolved debts;Default creates uncertainty over the nation’s economic prospects and future sovereign debt cases;It was a sweltering evening in Manhattan last week when Axel Kicillof, Argentina’s economy minister, confronted the cameras to insist his country had not defaulted on its international bonds for the eighth time in its history, but instead had suffered a “freak occurrence”.Only minutes earlier Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, had declared Argentina in “selective default”. Ramming the point home, a court-appointed mediator then released a statement halfway through Mr Kiciloff’s lecture saying that negotiations in New York between the minister and a group of holdout creditors to stop the default had failed.The semantic disagreement over “default” is just one of the confusions thrown up by what has been dubbed “the sovereign debt trial of the century”. Another is why Argentine bond prices have held up at about 80 cents to the dollar. Even allowing for the continuing market “melt-up”, that stands in sharp contrast to the aftermath of its calamitous $95bn default 13 years ago, when defaulted bonds traded as low as the mid-teens.“We are entering unknown territory,” says Roberto Lavagna, a former Argentine economy minister. “There are no precedents. That is why there is so much confusion.”At stake now, however, is more than just whether such elevated bond prices are justified by investor bullishness that Buenos Aires will strike a deal with the holdouts. A successful deal could calm fears that Argentina’s decade-long legal battle with a group of US hedge funds might hurt New York’s status as an international financial centre. The funds’ success in suing for full repayment on bonds issued under US law could make it easier for holdout creditors to disrupt future sovereign debt workouts and encourage countries to issue debt in other jurisdictions.“There is a cost to the world,” Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned last month.A deal would also ease doubts over the longer-term prospects for Latin America’s third-largest economy, and whether its president, the enigmatic Cristina Fernández even wants to resolve a situation which, for now, has bolstered her popularity at home while completely cutting off the country from international markets.“We reached this situation by accident, not by design,” says Mario Blejer, a former Argentine central bank governor who remains optimistic that a deal can be reached. “Nobody wanted a default.”Following its 2001 default, Argentina has two types of external bonds. The first is the result of two restructurings in 2005 and 2010 that paid 30 cents on the dollar and was accepted by 93 per cent of creditors. They are referred to as “exchange bonds”, and Argentina has continued to service them. That is why the country, until last week, enjoyed a non-default credit rating and some semblance of paying its debts on time.The second group are bonds Argentina has not serviced, owned by holdout creditors such as the New York hedge funds, led by Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital. Two years ago these investors won a groundbreaking legal ruling that the boilerplate “pari passu”, or “equal footing”, clause in their bond contracts required they be paid in full – just as exchange bondholders were also being paid in full as stipulated in their own restructured bond contracts.Judge Thomas Griesa, the US judge who has presided over the decade-long case, subsequently ruled that if Argentina paid the exchange bondholders, then under the pari passu clause it must pay the holdouts too. Hence confusion about the “default”.Last month Argentina deposited $539m with its trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, to pay exchange bondholders. But because Buenos Aires did not pay the holdouts as well, BNY Mellon was legally barred from passing on the funds. As the exchange creditors’ bond contracts require that they get the money, this left the country in default.For now, bond markets remain calm. Exchange creditors have resisted “accelerating” their bonds to demand immediate payment in full since that would amount to a $30bn demand, more than Argentina’s foreign exchange reserves. Payment would therefore require yet another restructuring and, quite possibly, an even worse “holdouts 2.0” situation.Globally, most investors also see Argentina as a unique case with few ramifications. International bond issuance, fuelled by ultra-low western interest rates, continues to swell: governments and companies in emerging markets have issued $796bn in debt this year, compared with $734bn in 2013, according to Dealogic data. Exotic issuers such as Pakistan, Zambia, Mongolia and Ecuador have successfully issued debt as Argentina’s creditor battle rolled on.Predictions that emerging markets would rewrite bond contracts to avoid holdout disruption have also failed to materialise. Pari passu clauses remain and, unlike eurozone nations, emerging market issuers have not turned to collective action clauses, which allow investor majorities to override minority holdout positions.“Issuers tend to benchmark new bonds against old, and are reluctant to issue bonds with terms and conditions that differ,” says Peter Young, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, which advised Pakistan on a $2bn issue this year. “There has not been a wholesale move to include these [collective action] clauses from emerging market countries with debt already in existence.”Nonetheless, market participants are not sitting on their hands. The International Capital Market Association is drawing up guidelines that could compel holdouts to take part in debt restructurings should a majority of investors agree.Others warn that the case, which ostensibly enhances creditor rights, could prompt investors to turn to local law bonds to avoid being similarly held hostage. After all, even Judge Griesa has at times been unsure which of Argentina’s exchange bonds, such as those issued under UK or Japanese law, were affected by his ruling – a confusion that hardly inspires confidence in US law.“Bond holders might conclude that a legal framework that places the interests of a minority above the interests of the majority of bond holders – the precedent set in this particular situation – is too risky,” says Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore, a specialist emerging markets fund manager. “The future in emerging markets belongs firmly to local law.”However uncertain the international implications, what comes next in Argentina is even more uncertain. Court-ordered mediation talks between Argentina and the holdouts have become poisonous, limiting the likelihood of a deal. Argentina has threatened to sue BNY Mellon and has questioned the mediator’s independence. It also wants an investigation into whether Elliott pushed Argentina into default so it could then profit from default insurance. Elliott denies that it owns such credit default swaps on Argentine exchange bonds.…Despite the bitter atmosphere, investors remain bullish on Argentina. The first reason for that is a belief that Buenos Aires has only refused to settle with the holdouts because it does not want to trigger the so-called Rufo clause in the exchange bonds requiring it to pay all creditors the same amount – a hugely expensive proposition that would essentially reverse the 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings.When the Rufo clause expires at the end of the year, that problem disappears. Argentina, so the thinking goes, could then settle the case, regain market access and issue fresh debt to pay off commitments and boost investment in its vast shale reserves. Credit risk would then drop, justifying current bond prices.So goes the theory. But some wonder if the Rufo clause is merely a fig leaf for Ms Fernández, 61, for whom standing up to the hedge funds, the “vultures” as she calls them, is central to her domestic political platform. Rufo may only be “a convenient red herring”, suggests Stuart Culverhouse, chief economist at Exotix, an emerging markets boutique.Such thinking is mirrored by increasing scepticism in Argentina about a private sector-led deal, under which a group of Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan and Citigroup, would buy the holdouts’ debt and then sell it to the government once the Rufo clause expires.Nicolás Dujovne, an economist in Buenos Aires, believes such a deal is “very unlikely”, not least because the Rufo clause means the government cannot give the banks any assurance it would buy the debt next year.Furthermore, Ms Fernández may not believe a deal is strictly necessary. Although the economy is in recession, and suffering high inflation and dwindling foreign reserves, it has been largely cut off from international credit markets for more than a decade and not done so badly.“If no deal is reached . . . the world isn’t suddenly going to fall apart,” says Aldo Ferrer, an Argentine economist. “Argentina wasn’t paralysed in the past, and it won’t be now either. Our problems are the same with or without the vultures.”…Ms Fernandez may also be counting on help from other emerging economies to tide her over. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president and another populist leader of a commodity exporting economy chafing under western legal sanctions, visited Buenos Aires last month. So did Xi Jinping, China’s president, when he announced a $10bn currency swap that could bolster depleted foreign reserves.We are entering unknown territory. There are no precedents. That is why there is so much confusionShould Argentina need further balance of payments support, some suggest it could be the first customer of the new Brics development bank, created with great fanfare last month as the emerging world’s response to western-dominated financial institutions. “It would make a lot of geopolitical sense, from the Brics’ perspective,” says Daniel Kerner, analyst at Eurasia Group, the risk consultancy.Whether or not Ms Fernández decides to settle, the second reason for the continued buoyancy of Argentine bonds is that her presidency ends in December 2015. Then, some believe, a more market-friendly administration will take her place and make resolving the holdouts problem a priority.But it is an open question whether the next Argentine president, who will probably be drawn from the Peronist party, really will be more market friendly. Whatever happens, there is little chance Ms Fernández can stop the holdout saga from casting a shadow over her political legacy.She refers to the period since 2003, when her predecessor and late husband Néstor Kirchner became president, as the “victorious decade”. It is based on the founding myth that the couple’s harsh treatment of foreign creditors was largely responsible for resurrecting Argentina from the 2001 crisis.But as the Kirchner era draws to a close, the country has come full circle with a fresh default and the possibility of a new economic crisis. “Argentina’s problems were there before the default, even if it will make things worse,” says Alberto Fernández, a former cabinet chief in both Ms Fernández’s and her husband’s governments, who points to the economy’s “very serious” problems. “It will be very difficult to solve these problems in the time Cristina has left. Her presidency isn’t going to end well.”The same may prove true for international debt markets. In recent decades the move towards an agreed resolution to critically indebted countries has been slow but visible, says Anna Gelpern, a law professor at Georgetown University. “The precedent set by Argentina threatens to put it into reverse,” she adds.——————————————-Pari passu clauses: Creditors scramble to recover debtIn the aftermath of two hurricanes and the global financial crisis, Grenada announced a plan to restructure its bonds in 2013, writes Elaine Moore. Not all of its creditors were happy.Taiwan’s Export-Import Bank sued in US courts for full payment of a loan not repaid in 2005 when Grenada re-established diplomatic ties with China, using the same pari passu argument employed by Argentina’s creditors.The case is on hold while the country restructures its debts but Mark Weidemaier, associate professor of law at the University of North Carolina, says that whatever the outcome, it is proof that Argentina’s case will not necessarily be unique. Pari passu clauses are standard across sovereign bond contracts, he says. Ukraine’s debt contains the same clause, as does that of Cyprus.Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, which campaigns for debt relief in poor countries, says Argentina’s default has set a precedent that could be used by holdout creditors all over the world. He says jurisdiction also matters. In the 1980s the Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire) borrowed from energy company Energoinvest. The planned power lines were never built and the country stopped payments. In 2004 the debt was purchased by US hedge fund FG Hemisphere for about $3m, which then sued the country for more than £100m for full repayment. Courts in the British crown dependency of Jersey ruled in the investors’ favour in 2010. But this was overturned by the Privy Council in England in 2012.The DRC is also considering a challenge to a US ruling that it should pay $68m for 1980s debts purchased by Themis Capital and Des Moines Investment. Jubilee says the Argentina case makes an appeal look less likely.
157;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Q&A: Argentina on the brink of default;;Argentina will default by the end of Wednesday unless it makes a $539m interest payment on its performing bonds. The Argentine government has deposited the money with Bank of New York Mellon, the bondholders’ trustee, but New York judge Thomas Griesa has forbidden the bank from transferring the funds to the bondholders. Doing so would violate his ruling, upheld on June 16 by the US Supreme Court, that Argentina must pay its so-called “holdout” creditors in full at the same time as holders of its performing debt.Why have the two sides failed to reach an agreement?The holdout creditors refused debt restructurings after Argentina’s 2001 default, instead suing Argentina for full payment. Although Judge Griesa ruled in their favour in November 2012, Argentina has persistently refused to pay up, most recently on the grounds that payment would violate the so-called RUFO (Rights Upon Future Offers) clause in the restructured debt. This clause, which expires at the end of this year, forbids the country from paying the holdouts any more than the rest of its creditors. Buenos Aires says that, if the RUFO clause was triggered, it might have to pay its exchange bondholders anything from $120bn to $500bn.There had been little progress in talks between Argentina and the holdouts since the Supreme Court rejected Argentina’s appeal in June, with the government refusing face-to-face meetings. But that changed when Axel Kicillof, the economy minister, unexpectedly turned up at the negotiations yesterday evening, raising hopes that a deal could be reached.What are the chances of a last-minute deal?Analysts have long argued that, if there was going to be a deal, it would come at the last minute, with both sides waiting for the other to blink in a high-stakes game.Argentina was hoping that the holdouts would ask the court to issue a new “stay” that would suspend Judge Griesa’s ruling, staving off default and allowing the negotiations to continue. But the holdouts say they will only do so if Argentina shows good faith in negotiations, something which has been lacking.Analysts have been coming to the conclusion that the government’s stated concerns about the RUFO clause are no bluff, and that it genuinely fears the consequences of triggering it more than it does a default.The Argentine banking association is attempting to stage a rescue operation. According to the local press, Argentine bankers flew into New York last night with a proposal either to provide a guarantee to the holdouts in exchange for a new stay, or to buy their defaulted debt outright.How have markets reacted?Since the US Supreme Court ruling in June, investors have demanded more in return for the risks involved in holding Argentine debt.The yield on Argentina’s government bond due in 2033 rose above 12 per cent in the aftermath of the court’s decision. The cost of protecting the debt against default climbed to its highest level since February.However analysts pointed out that the bond yields remain low compared to the 16 per cent plus rate reached last year.As the deadline for default drew nearer on Wednesday, investors were hopeful of a possible deal, pushing down the 2033 bond yield to 8.83 per cent.What would be the consequences of a default?A default would benefit no one. For the holdouts, it would simply mean not being paid – and they have already been waiting for more than a decade. But they would also lose their most powerful bargaining tool: the threat of a default.For Argentina, the potential consequences range from “not much” (according to pro-government commentators) to quite serious, although not as serious as the country’s previous default in 2001, when the economy had a been in a deep crisis for years.Still, most economists predict a deepening of the existing recession, higher inflation (already among the highest in the world), and pressure on foreign exchange reserves (which are dangerously low) probably causing a second devaluation this year.Although Argentina’s government has been unable to borrow abroad since 2001, borrowing costs will rise to punishing levels for Argentine companies and institutions. These include indebted provinces and YPF, the state oil company, which has grand plans for the development of Argentina’s vast Vaca Muerta shale formation.The immediate effect will be that Argentina could be placed on selective default by rating agencies perhaps by the end of today, while investors in credit default swaps would quickly seek payment.It is unclear whether or not holders of the newly defaulted debt will “accelerate” their bonds and demand full payment immediately. With almost $30bn in foreign debt that could enter into default, this could become a serious headache for the government. However, analysts say that the majority of bondholders are unlikely to accelerate their bonds and may prefer to wait until a possible deal next year.What about the rest of the world?Any fall in Argentine bonds is unlikely to be mirrored elsewhere and few expect any contagion in emerging markets. In spite of the turbulence hitting Argentine bonds over the past two months, emerging market debt has not experienced the sort of sell off seen last year when the US Federal Reserve said it was set to taper its bond buying programme. In fact, investor appetite for sovereign debt issued by countries with low credit ratings has remained strong and is likely to remain as such even in case of an Argentine default.There may, however, be significant implications for future sovereign debt restructurings, which many fear may now become harder, since Judge Griesa’s ruling has provided a potentially dangerous precedent. Ironically, however, the default could actually provide impetus for plans that have been in the works for years to make it more difficult for recalcitrant creditors to hold out against countries that need to restructure their debt.
158;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-07-18T19:11:14Z;BNY Mellon shelves sale of corporate trust division;;Bank of New York Mellon, under pressure to boost flagging returns to shareholders including the activist investor Nelson Peltz, has shelved the sale of its corporate trust business after failing to find a buyer willing to pay enough for the division.The world’s biggest custody bank said it would be keeping its corporate trust arm as it revealed a 1.3 per cent slip in second-quarter revenues and the first drop in its long-term assets under management in more than four years after losing a large client.Net income in the period dropped by a third to $554m, or 48 earnings a share, compared with the 44 cents a share forecast by analysts.BNY Mellon has been struggling to boost profits in the face of five years of low interest rates that cut into the amount of money the bank is able to eke out from the business of safeguarding trillions of dollars worth of client assets.The low returns have prompted large shareholders to criticise the company’s failure to keep expenses under control and meet targets on profitability since BNY Mellon was formed in 2007 from the merger of Bank of New York – the oldest bank in the US – and Mellon Financial, an asset management company.Mr Peltz added another headwind to the bank when his hedge fund, Trian, last month revealed a $1bn stake in the company. It is unclear what Mr Peltz wants from BNYMellon, but he has a history of agitating for radical change at companies including Pepsi and rival custody bank, State Street.“Some people viewed the involvement of Nelson Peltz as a potential catalyst for the company to offload some poor-performing businesses and corporate trust was one that had been mentioned,” said Jim Shanahan, analyst at Edward Jones.He added: “I’m not really surprised to hear that the bids were low. The bids weren’t strong because you’re paying for future growth that may be difficult to achieve.Some people viewed the involvement of Nelson Peltz as a potential catalyst for the company to offload some poor-performing businesses and corporate trust was one that had been mentionedProfits in the corporate trust business, where the bank helps tens of thousands of companies process payments on the debt they issue to private investors, have also been hit by low interest rates.BNY Mellon had hired Goldman Sachs to explore a potential sale of the business but said on Friday that it would be retaining the division after being unable to find a buyer willing to pay a high enough premium for the unit.The Financial Times previously reported that Mitsubishi UFJ was considering a bid for the business, which was expected to fetch about $2.5bn for BNY Mellon, according to people familiar with the proposed deal.“We found out that it probably makes sense for us to hold the business and benefit from the upside of that business,” Todd Gibbons, chief financial officer, said in an interview.Expenses, excluding a one-time $109m charge related to an error in administrating some funds, fell 4 per cent in the period as the bank cut jobs and slashed its travel budget.

No financial details were disclosed.Under the proposed agreement, DeAWM will outsource its property fund finance, fund accounting, asset management accounting, and client and financial reporting functions to BNY Mellon.Approximately 80 members of DeAWM’s global property fund finance team will transfer to BNY Mellon’s alternative investment services team once the deal is finalised.Samir Pandiri, chief executive of asset servicing at BNY Mellon, said: “We are committed to retaining the experience and expertise of DeAWM’s global fund finance team and will rely on these employees to continue to drive the growth of our real estate fund administration business.”Frank La Salla, chief executive of BNY Mellon’s alternative investment services business said the market for property asset servicing is poised for further growth, driven by changes in the regulatory environment and the continuing shift by investors into alternative investments.BNY Mellon has $645bn of alternative assets under administration and/or custody.
160;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-06-30T23:08:24Z;Activist Peltz turns attention to BNY Mellon;;The activist investor Nelson Peltz has revealed a $1bn stake in Bank of New York Mellon, firing the opening shot in a campaign for the custody bank to improve shareholder returns.Mr Peltz’s hedge fund Trian said it would like to meet the bank’s management and board, to discuss “ideas and initiatives to drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value”. The bank said it looked forward to engaging with them.The polite opening salvos belie Mr Peltz’s history of aggressively pressing his case for change at companies, most famously in the food and drink sector, where he agitated for the sale of Cadbury to Kraft Foods and is at present trying to persuade Pepsi to split off its snacks business.He has also targeted financial companies, including asset manager Legg Mason and, in 2011, BNY Mellon’s rival custody bank, State Street. Trian argued that State Street should cut costs, return cash to shareholders and consider separating its asset management division from the custody operations.The hedge fund refused on Monday to elaborate on its ideas for BNY Mellon, but people close to the situation said it had been tempted into the stock by investor discontent over the company’s recent operating performance.“Trian had success at State Street and steered them to think more of shareholder returns, so BNY Mellon has a good partner,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “It still has a way to go before operating margins and returns get to the levels of the guys doing a better job.”Years of low interest rates have eaten into the profits BNY Mellon can make from the business of safeguarding trillions of dollars’ worth of customers’ assets, forcing it to look to new sources of revenue and reduce expenses.It announced this year that it would take a $80m-$100m charge in the second quarter as it trims jobs and invests in new technology to automate services. It forecast that these cost-cutting efforts would save it about $100m a year.Two top-30 shareholders in the bank told the Financial Times in April that they were disillusioned by a failure to keep expenses under control and meet targets on profitability since the company was formed in 2007 from the merger of Bank of New York – the oldest bank in the US, created by one of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton – and Mellon Financial, an asset management company.Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA, has suggested the bank could be split up, but Gerald Hassell, chief executive, made a public defence of keeping the asset management division– which manages $1.6tn in assets – at the company’s annual meeting in April.“This segment provides very consistent earnings that enhances our performance under stressed scenarios and it also requires very minimal use of our balance sheet,” he said.

But a 30-day grace period means it can still avoid formal default and most investors believe that, eventually, the country will settle in order to regain access to international markets.Argentine “authorities continue to provide mixed signals about [their] willingness to negotiate”, said Gordian Kemen, head of Latin America fixed income research at HSBC. However, said the bank, its “base case continues to be a negotiated solution . . . [as] the costs associated with a default largely exceed the costs of a settlement”.Monday’s deadline comes as Argentina’s 12-year legal battle with holdouts, led by NML Capital, the New York hedge fund, has entered an aggressive endgame that has also seen US regulations spill over into international markets not governed by New York law.The acrimonious battle reached a climax on Friday after the New York judge presiding over the case ruled that the $832m payment due on Monday that Argentina had made to holders of the country’s restructured bonds was illegal as it did not also include a $1.5bn payment to the holdouts, as required under a controversial prior ruling.Furthermore, Judge Thomas Griesa ruled that a payment by Argentina to holders of a euro-denominated restructured bond was also illegal, even though the particular bond is denominated under English law.Axel Kicillof, the economy minister, earlier described the ruling as “capricious” and “absurd” and the court as “biased”. NML responded by calling Argentina’s failure to pay it “a brazen step in violation” of court orders. Judge Griesa urged both sides to negotiate. “It would be desirable, if possible, to have a settlement,” he said.Investors have so far shrugged off the legal too-ing and fro-ing as they believe Buenos Aires’ actions and rhetoric are largely for domestic political consumption. With the economy in recession, they mask Argentina’s underlying desire to regain access to international credit to fund development of the country’s huge shale gas reserves and also avert another financial crisis.To that end, the government has this year settled claims with the Paris Club of creditor nations and with Repsol, the Spanish oil company, whose subsidiary it renationalised. Argentine restructured bonds due in 2033 have rallied 17 per cent this year, despite the prospect of Monday’s default.“I think there is a lot of negotiation behind the scenes and that the government is, meanwhile, using the well-worn tactic of turning up the fan,” said one Buenos Aires analyst who asked not to be named. “Look at the Repsol, Paris Club deals. In the end, payments are proportional to the loudness of the inflammatory speeches.”The case has sparked intense debate about whether it is “morally fair” for the holdouts to be paid in full when 93 per cent of bondholders took stiff writedowns following Argentina’s $95bn default in 2001. Mr Kicillof made the argument forcefully in a speech to the UN last week.“This has been a very difficult process for [Argentine] President Cristina Fernández as not paying the holdouts has been one of her strongest beliefs,” said Daniel Kerner, head of the Latin America practice at Eurasia, a risk consultancy. Although she wants “to be the moral winner . . . her government is on a path to paying the holdouts given the lack of alternatives”.A June 12 survey found 54 per cent in favour of the government’s position while a national poll in September found 74 per cent thought Argentina should negotiateThe case has also raised broader questions about whether it will make future sovereign debt restructurings harder, as it may reduce the incentives for creditors to participate – especially for bonds issued under New York law.That in turn has raised questions about the continuing relative attractiveness of New York as an international financial centre.“For any sovereign considering a New York law bond issuance, NML is an obvious red flag. It gives sovereigns reason for pause,” said Tim Samples, professor of legal studies at the University of Georgia.A senior European banker also grumbled this week about the confusing international consequences of the NML ruling. “I would not want to choose New York over London,” he said. “It is a question of attitude to contracts and law.”Meanwhile, there are more pressing issues at hand, such as whether Argentina will settle and on what terms. Eurasia gives a 60-70 per cent chance of an eventual settlement. Argentines appear similarly divided.“The government wants to play the victim,” said Horacio Vázquez, an unemployed electrician who 14 years ago ploughed his life savings into Argentine bonds and has since sought full repayment. “What it needs to do is to go to the court and work out a way to pay what it is obliged to.”Hugo Pérez, 45, a former professional footballer who represented Argentina in the 1994 World Cup, takes a different view. He also bought Argentine bonds, but then accepted a restructuring that paid about 30 cents on the dollar. “I resigned myself to stop fighting and look ahead,” he said.Local polls give a similar impression. A June 12 survey found 54 per cent in favour of the government’s position while a national poll in September found 74 per cent thought Argentina should negotiate. More than half also said their image of Ms Fernández would stay the same if she negotiated, while a little more than a third said it would improve.“I hope we don’t default,” said Mr Vázquez. “But I am afraid it might happen.”——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Law has a hard time in abnormal circumstances / From Mr Kees van Ravenhorst
162;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Argentina’s payment illegal, says US district judge;;Argentina looked headed for technical default on Monday after a federal judge said the country’s attempts to meet interest payments on its restructured debt via trustee Bank of New York Mellon were “illegal”.US District Judge Thomas Griesa said in New York that the bank should return a $539m deposit made by the South American nation on Thursday. The funds were intended to cover interest payments of up to $832m to Argentine bondholders who did participate in the country’s previous debt restructurings, which come due on June 30.Judge Griesa called Argentina’s decision to deposit the money an “explosive action” that violated previous court orders which determined that so-called holdout investors and holders of restructured debt be paid at the same time.“This payment is illegal and will not be made,” Judge Griesa said on Friday at a hearing in New York. The judge warned that any attempts to pay holders of restructured debt would be in contempt of the court and ordered BNY Mellon to return the money.Lawyers representing the holdout investors, led by NML Capital, a subsidiary of US billionaire investor Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital, condemned the deposit and said the country “defiantly and contemptuously” violated the judge’s orders.Argentina’s economy minister Axel Kicillof said on Thursday the government had proceeded with the payment, which included deposits into two accounts held by BNY Mellon with the country’s central bank, as a sign of its willingness to comply with the terms of its bond contracts.The most casual followers of the Argentine debt saga will be familiar with the Latin term pari passu, or “equal footing” – or, in this case, equal payment to all holders of Argentine bonds, whether or not those holders took part in the country’s two restructuring programmes in 2005 and 2010 following its 2001 default.Continue readingFailure to meet the June 30 deadline would put Argentina into technical default, although the country still has a 30-day grace period to avoid formal default, its second in less than 15 years.Buenos Aires has argued that it cannot meet the $15bn payment it claims Judge Griesa’s ruling will generate. The holdouts did not participate in the country’s two previous debt restructurings.Still, Argentine officials last week said the country had agreed to a meeting in New York to discuss debt repayments to holdouts, and potentially put an end to a decade-long battle that has raged in US courts since the aftermath of the country’s massive default of 2002.The meeting between holdouts and Argentine officials has yet to take place.“I hoped [negotiations] would begin this afternoon,” Judge Griesa said. “Get the Republic to the table.”
163;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-06-26T19:53:06Z;Argentina deposits $832m to pay bonds;;Argentina has deposited $832m to meet interest payments on restructured debt by a Monday deadline in its latest attempt to avoid a second default in less than 15 years.Economy minister Axel Kicillof said on Thursday the government had proceeded with the payment, of which $539m was deposited with the Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for the disputed Argentine bonds, and the remainder with other financial intermediaries.But the move placed the country at odds with a New York federal court order that prohibits Argentina from making payments on its restructured debt without also doing so on its defaulted debt to so-called holdout investors – who did not participate in the country’s previous debt restructurings.“This is a brazen step in violation of this court’s orders and it warrants a swift and decisive response,” said NML Capital, the hedge fund leading the holdout creditors, in a letter to the court.Mr Kicillof said that by making the deposits Argentina was showing its willingness to comply with the terms of its bond contracts.“Complying with a ruling doesn’t exempt us from honouring our obligations,” the minister said at a press conference in Buenos Aires. “Argentina will meet its obligations, will pay its debt, will honour its promises.”Any attempt to block the payment would violate the rights of investors who accepted the terms of Argentina’s two previous debt restructurings, Mr Kicillof said.Buenos Aires has argued that it cannot meet the $15bn payment it claims New York district judge Thomas Griesa’s ruling will generate, requesting a court “stay” on the decision while the right “conditions” for payments can be found.The economy minister on Thursday urged the judge to delay enforcement of the court order, allowing the country to discuss debt repayments with holdout investors. Judge Griesa denied Argentina’s request for a stay after Mr Kicillof’s press conference.The New York court order also prevents BNY Mellon and other third party agents from dispensing payments on the restructured debt unless holdout creditors are also paid.“In our role as trustee, BNY Mellon will comply with any court order by which it is deemed bound,” a spokesman for BNY Mellon said in a statement last week.Ron Gruendl, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, said the bank had no immediate comment about Argentina’s deposit on Thursday.“This seems to be part of Argentina’s tactics to raise international awareness for what in their view is an unfair ruling,” said Siobhan Mordern, the head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies.This is a brazen step in violation of this court’s orders and it warrants a swift and decisive response“They are trying to defuse the stigma of default and shifting the blame to the US courts.”Analysts said the deposited money could now be embargoed to pay the holdout hedge funds at the centre of 2012’s ruling, led by NML Capital, a subsidiary of US billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliot Capital.“Technically, because there is no stay, the Bank of New York would have to use this money in accordance with Griesa’s sentence and therefore share the money out between exchange bondholders and the other funds in the litigation,” said lawyer Eugenio Bruno, speaking to Clarin newspaper. “The government still has [more than] 30 days to implement its strategy.”

165;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-06-19T02:08:47Z;Six banks sued over trustee roles;;A group of big investors including Blackrock and Pimco are suing six different banks including Deutsche Bank and HSBC for their role as trustees of mortgage-backed securities in the lead up to and during the financial crisis.In six similarly-worded suits, filed on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in New York, the investors alleged that the banks - which also include Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo - ignored “pervasive” deficiencies in the underlying loan pools and the servicing of the loans.Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Citi and Wells Fargo declined to comment. BNY Mellon and US Bancorp did not immediately respond.Blackrock declined to comment and Pimco did not respond to a request.Banks in the US have faced years of legal wrangling with both big investors and the government over their practices in the lead up to the financial crisis, costing them more than $100bn in fines, penalties and settlements.But, the new focus of this investor group, which alleges billions of dollars in damages, is on whether these banks fulfilled their fiduciary duties on large pools of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2004 and 2008.As trustees, the banks would be expected to protect the rights of investors by overseeing the enforcement of terms on these pools of mortgage-backed securities.Investors can be protected by repurchase agreements that force lenders to buy back loans if the credit quality turns out to be worse than pledged when they were sold.The suits were first reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Wednesday.The other investors include Aegon, Brookfield, Kore, Prudential, Sealink and TIAA. The plaintiffs, represented by Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesman for Charles Schwab, confirmed that Schwab was party to the suit but declined to comment further. Prudential, TIAA-Cref and Brookfield both declined to comment. AEGON USA, and DZ Bank did not respond to requests for comment. Sealink, which has been party to similar suits in the past, could not be reached.Blackrock and Pimco have teamed up alongside other big investors against the banks before, using the law firm Gibbs & Bruns, demanding billions of dollars from the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Those suits are ongoing.
166;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-06-18T13:26:35Z;BNY Mellon stuck in global debt saga;;"This week’s decision from the Supreme Court means that Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for the disputed Argentine bonds, remains stuck in the middle of a still unfolding debt saga.The bank has been caught in the dispute ever since New York’s Judge Thomas Griesa ruled that Argentina could not pay the holders of the defaulted debt it restructured in 2005 and 2010 without also paying “holdouts” of the bonds.As trustee for Argentina’s restructured bonds, BNY Mellon is charged with dispensing payments from the country to investors in the exchanged debt. That leaves it in the thorny position of having to comply with the US court order while still meeting its legal obligations as a trustee.“In our role as trustee, BNY Mellon will comply with any court order by which it is deemed bound,” a spokesman for the bank said in a statement this week.BNY Mellon’s uncomfortable position underscores the intermediary role played by the custody bank, as well as New York’s historic position as a global payment processing centre and hub for sovereign debt sales.It raises the question of whether sovereign debt issuers will continue to choose to sell such bonds in New York, where they may be subject to stricter law set by the Argentine precedent, or decamp to the potentially friendlier issuing environs of London.Some observers believe English law to be a better defence against debt exchange holdouts, citing a 2005 analysis by a lawyer’s committee established by the Bank of England. It says courts should not construe pari passu – meaning “equal footing” – to mean “equal payment” in bond contracts, the interpretation which the US courts have used against Argentina.“That’s a dramatic leverage in the world of sovereign debt,” said Mitu Gulati, a law professor at Duke University. “We have to see whether the markets think this is a good thing or a bad thing.”For months, market participants have speculated that Argentina may try to reroute payments around New York law, and possibly BNY Mellon. Argentina’s economy minister Axel Kicillof confirmed on Tuesday that the country was now looking to restructure debt held by foreign creditors under local law in order to avoid the US courts.That still leaves BNY Mellon in a sticky spot; the bank could be exposed to lawsuits or contempt of court charges if it is deemed to be helping Argentina avoid the US order.BNY Mellon has considered stepping down as trustee for the Argentine bonds but can only do so if it is able to find a replacement, people familiar with its thinking have said.No other banks have yet offered to take over as trustee for the troublesome debt."

168;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-06-01T05:17:21Z;Unprecedented demand for unsponsored ADRs;Resurgent global interest in blocks of shares of non-US companies that trade in the US;Increasing demand for European equities from US fund managers has led to an unprecedented rise in unsponsored American depositary receipt programmes, according to data from BNY Mellon, a leading custodian bank.ADRs – blocks of shares of non-US companies that trade in the US – have been around since 1927, but a 2008 ruling by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator, widened the market. For the first time it permitted unsponsored ADRs, which are issued by a depositary bank without any involvement from the underlying company.Amid resurgent global interest in European equities, a record 93 unsponsored ADRs were created last year, up from 62 in 2012, according to BNY Mellon. Trading volumes rose 21 per cent, to $2.4bn in the 12 months to May 29, according to Bloomberg.“It tells an interesting story of growth when overall equity trading, or [trading in] any asset class for that matter, is at a historic low,” said David Stueber, managing director of BNY Mellon Depositary Receipts.Mr Stueber said demand was driven by smaller US asset managers, as well as those running retail funds, managed accounts and exchange traded funds that are restricted to buying US-traded securities.“Smaller fund managers want to do what the bigger managers can,” said Mr Stueber, who added that buying ADRs rather than overseas equities could be cheaper, more convenient and more tax efficient.ADRs of luxury goods companies, such as France’s LVMH and Pernod Ricard, BMW of Germany and Swiss watchmaker Swatch, are particularly attractive, although the UK accounts for 31 per cent of unsponsored programmes, BNY Mellon said.
169;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-05-09T11:56:10Z;Mitsubishi UFJ weighs corporate trust bid;;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the biggest bank in Japan, is weighing a bid for the corporate trust division of Bank of New York Mellon, as it seeks to shore up its presence in the world’s largest economy.MUFG has accelerated a push outside Japan in recent years, agreeing last summer to pay about $5bn for a majority stake in Thailand’s Bank of Ayudhya.The bank is particularly keen to build in the US, telling investors this year that it wanted to become a top 10 US financial institution “by scale and profitability.” It ranks 12th by deposits, according to data provider SNL Financial.BNY Mellon has been working with Goldman Sachs to find buyers for the corporate trust unit, which helps tens of thousands of companies process payments on the debt they issue to private investors, while also representing investors in defaults. The US bank’s chief executive, Gerald Hassell, has been under pressure from shareholders to sell assets and cut costs to keep pace with rivals such as State Street.A sale of the corporate trust business could fetch about $2.5bn for BNY Mellon, according to people familiar with the situation.MUFG declined to comment on the potential bid.Japan’s big banks have been beneficiaries of the country’s “Abenomics”-led revival, as the growth-friendly policies of Shinzo Abe, prime minister, have kept credit costs down while boosting stocks and bolstering property. Yet margins on new lending continue to be squeezed by the central bank’s pledge to keep interest rates very low and stable, meaning that a modest pick-up in borrowing is not leading to materially higher earnings.In its full-year results for the year to March, due next Wednesday, MUFG is expected to report Y956bn of net income, up about 12 per cent from the Y852bn it reported a year earlier. But analysts expect net profits to drop about 6 per cent this fiscal year amid “narrowing loan margins and limited sustained growth in private credit,” according to Miki Murakami of Fitch.That puts the onus on building overseas.“I wouldn’t be remotely surprised if MUFG were interested,” said David Threadgold, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in Tokyo, noting that MUFG’s trust bank is Japan’s number two by assets under management, behind Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings. “These are technology- and scale-driven businesses.”However, he added that president Nobuyuki Hirano remained focused on building a retail and commercial banking business in the US.If a deal for BNY Mellon’s corporate trust unit went ahead, he said, it would be “incidental” to MUFG’s US strategy, rather than “a key part of achieving it”.

171;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Bank of New York Mellon eyes charging clients for euro deposits;;Bank of New York Mellon said it was considering charging clients for depositing euros if the European Central Bank decides to cut key interest rates below zero.The potential move by the world’s biggest custody bank comes after Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said last week that the region could require “further monetary stimulus” to offset a strengthening euro.Several officials have said cutting the rate the central bank pays on deposits held at the ECB below the present level of zero would be their preferred option – raising the prospect that customers may have to pay to park their savings as commercial banks seek to offset the lower interest rates.“If the eurozone were to go to negative rates that would actually present the opportunity for us to charge for deposits and we are giving that very serious consideration,” Todd Gibbons, BNY Mellon’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call as the bank unveiled its first-quarter earnings.BNY Mellon rode a wave of rising global asset prices to swing to a profit in the first three months of the year.The lender reported $661m of net profits in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $266m in the same period a year earlier, when a US court blocked the bank from using $850m worth of foreign tax credits. Assets under management jumped 6 per cent thanks mainly to “higher market values”, the company said in a statement.The first-quarter profit equated to 57 cents a share – higher than the 53 cents forecast by analysts. Revenues in the period were flat at $3.6bn, however, missing expectations of $3.73bn for the period.BNY Mellon has been grappling with low interest rates which eat into the amount of money it can make from safeguarding trillions of dollars worth of clients’ assets. At the same time, the bank has been criticised by some investors and analysts for failing to rein in expenses to offset its shrinking profit margins.“The management team is focused on actively realigning the business model for the new regulatory environment, controlling expenses and generating strong returns on tangible common equity,” Gerald Hassell, chief executive, said in the statement.In addition to low interest rates, BNY Mellon has been dealing with new rules including the so-called “supplementary leverage ratio”, which requires big banks to hold capital against all of their assets. The rule is particularly onerous for custody banks since they hold huge portfolios of assets on behalf of their customers.Mr Gibbons said the bank’s supplementary leverage ratio was 4.7 per cent at the end of March, compared with the “low fours” estimate BNY Mellon gave last year when the US regulators first proposed the new 5 to 6 per cent requirement.Charging clients for deposits is controversial since many customers balk at the idea of paying for what they consider a basic financial service. BNY Mellon has previously charged depositors to hold Danish kroner and Swiss francs after the two countries cut interest rates to stem their currencies from appreciating.——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Farewell, fidelity fiduciary banking / From Mr Björn Brown

173;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
174;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Biggest US banks forced to hold $68bn in extra capital;Regulators ratchet up limits with new 5% leverage ratio;US regulators have held out the prospect of more draconian measures after ratcheting up capital requirements for the biggest US banks – from JPMorgan Chase to Goldman Sachs – forcing them to hold at least $68bn in additional capital.A new “ leverage ratio” will force the eight largest US banks to hold a minimum of 5 per cent equity to total assets to absorb losses in a crisis and proposes adopting a more stringent way of calculating the rule.The leverage ratio is supposed to be a backstop to other capital rules that are “risk-weighted”. It does not allow banks to use their own models, which some critics have warned allows institutions to game the system.It is tougher than a new international metric that requires banks to reach a 3 per cent minimum of equity to assets and potentially hinders the profitability of the eight banks affected – Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo – compared with their rivals in Europe.Dan Tarullo, the Fed governor in charge of regulation, indicated that he wanted to go further. He signalled that the Fed might impose an additional risk-based capital charge on the biggest US banks, bringing it “to a higher level than the minimum agreed to internationally” to discourage short-term wholesale funding.Investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman, which do not have the same deposit base as retail banks such as Wells Fargo, might have most to lose if Mr Tarullo succeeded in imposing an additional capital surcharge.He has highlighted the problem of bank dependence on short-term wholesale funding on numerous occasions. But his comments were a new hint at the potential severity of the regulatory response.On Tuesday, the Fed, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency finalised the criteria for big banks to have a more than 5 per cent leverage ratio at the holding company level and at least 6 per cent at the bank subsidiary level.“The supplementary leverage ratio is a more reliable measure that is simpler to calculate, understand and enforce than the subjective risk-weighted measures, and it provides a highly useful initial assessment of a bank’s balance sheet strength,” said Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation vice-chairman Thomas Hoenig, a strong proponent of the new rule.US regulators also said they were considering adopting the same changes to how assets in the leverage ratio are calculated as the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed in January.Banks have until January 1, 2018 to comply with the leverage ratio. Fed staff said the leverage ratio was likely to have limited effect on monetary policy, even though it could depress demand for certain low-risk, low-return assets.The Fed said that could affect interest rates or reduce liquidity in short-term funding markets, but added that the agency has a “flexible and diverse policy toolkit that can offset most, if not all, unwanted pressures”.
175;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-04-08T17:01:33Z;BNY Mellon rejects call to split off asset management arm;;Bank of New York Mellon faced down shareholder angst over costs, profitability and executive pay at its annual meeting, with Gerald Hassell, its chairman and chief executive, rejecting calls to spin off the company’s asset management business.Mr Hassell told investors that such a spin-off had been considered. “We’ve done the math, we’ve done it several times, we continue to look at it,” he said. “We’re not afraid to take action.”There were questions from Third Avenue, the 28th biggest shareholder, with a $241m stake, over its lacklustre returns and business mix. “At what point do some of these businesses deserve to be set free away from the regulatory shackles on your bank?” asked Vic Cunningham, an analyst at Third Avenue.Mr Hassell defended running investment services, which provided an array of trust and custody work such as foreign exchange, in tandem with the asset management business. A lot of the products served the same clients, he said.Two large investors had told the Financial Times they were disillusioned by expenses and executive pay at BNY Mellon, which has underperformed rivals such as State Street.Providing new detail on the effect of ultra-low interest rates and regulation, Mr Hassell said strengthening the “tri-party repo” market, as required by the Federal Reserve, came at a price.BNY Mellon and JPMorgan Chase are the two banks that administer the $1.6tn-a-day tri-party repo market, standing between two other parties, which exchange securities for short-term cash loans.“We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished,” said Mr Hassell, saying annual costs had risen by $73m from that one piece of regulation.BNY Mellon was particularly affected by low interest rates, Mr Hassell said. The bank had lost about $402m a year in pre-tax profit from waiving fees on money market funds because of their weak returns.For the first time, he offered a forecast that about 70 per cent of that profit could come back with a 50 basis points increase in interest rates.Despite the unrest from several large shareholders, 93 per cent of investors voted to approve an executive pay plan. A proposal to install an independent chairman drew support from 22 per cent.Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA, noted that BNY Mellon’s investor presentation and webcast meeting gave more information than other banks. But he added: “It is terrible that no independent directors answered questions. This plays into the hands of those who want to split the chairman and CEO positions.”BNY Mellon is the first large bank to hold its annual meeting. Unlike several of its large peers, it chose to host shareholders at its headquarters. Four of the top six banks have chosen venues away from home and away from most large shareholders.
176;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:42+0000;Oxford brightens dark London skies with emphatic Boat Race win;;Oxford were handed an emphatic win in the 160th University Boat Race which was contested in murky drizzle in west London on Sunday after a light blues’ mishap just after five minutes into the race.Cambridge could not recover from a clash of oars that nearly tipped the crewmember in their number two seat, the American Luke Juckett, into the Thames. That forced them to miss four or five strokes and allowed the Oxford crew first to open up, then stretch out an unassailable lead.Oxford, favourites and defending champions, went into the race 5kg a man lighter and giving their rivals a height advantage of 7cm a man.History favours the heavier crew but the Oxford boat was packed with stars. They included the Kiwi Storm Uru, at only 11st 6lbs, a world champion and Olympic medallist in lightweight double sculls, and Malcolm Howard, at 17st 1lb, who was a member of an eight that won gold in the Beijing Olympics and silver at London 2012.The dark blues started the BNY Mellon Boat Race with what was still their biggest, but also most successful and experienced eight, and they pressed home that edge in experience. They delivered an emphatic victory, keeping control of the race after the clash of oars, and with Constantine Louloudis, in the stroke seat, securing his hat-trick of boat race wins.Afterwards, umpire Richard Phelps said: “The contact [between the boats] was slight but the impact was great. Cambridge’s appeal was that they were correcting themselves when the foul occurred and Oxford were not on the correct station [course] but from my perspective Oxford were on the proper station.”Steve Trapmore, the Cambridge coach, said there was a clash of oars and Cambridge caught a crab on what turned out to be a tough day. “No one would have wanted to win in that way,” he added.Oxford had been forced by the winter floods to move their training away from Wallingford further downriver on the Thames to Caversham and Dorney.Both crews were relatively young, Oxford’s average age being 26 and Cambridge’s 24. The light blues included 20-year-old Ivo Dawkins, in the number three seat, who is the son of Will Dawkins, a former FT foreign editor. Dawkins Snr was in the Cambridge crew that sank in 1978 after shipping water on the approach to Barnes bridge.Oxford’s winning margin, by more than 11 lengths, was the longest since 1973. It was their fifth victory in seven years with Cambridge still leading the series overall by 82 victories to 77, with a controversial dead heat in 1877.
177;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-04-06T21:11:29Z;Bank of New York Mellon investors balk at board pay and expenses;;Shareholders in Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, are voicing concern about expenses and executive pay ahead of its annual meeting on Tuesday.Two top-30 shareholders said they were disillusioned by a failure to keep expenses under control and meet targets on profitability since the company was formed in 2007 from the merger of Bank of New York – the oldest bank in the US created by one of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton – and Mellon Financial, an asset management firm.Gerald Hassell, who replaced Bob Kelly as chief executive after a boardroom clash in 2011, has a target of 10 per cent return on equity. But the bank has failed to meet its targets, and trailed rivals, such as State Street, in profitability, with margins several percentage points lower and persistently higher costs.“It has become of increasing concern to us,” said one large shareholder. “We’ve noticed it and it has continued and it is in contradiction to the objectives and plans by the CEO when he took over.“They are underperforming their close peers on cost and a larger set of financial peers. State Street has done much better on expenses.”Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA who has suggested the bank should be split up, added: “This is not a close call. In the case of BNY and their need to better optimise operations shareholders are almost unanimous.”Mr Mayo said he planned to attend Tuesday’s meeting, the first of the banks to hold this year’s shareholder gatherings, and try to persuade the board to conduct a study into the costs and benefits of selling its asset management division.He noted that a combination of State Street and BlackRock, the asset management group, would be about the same size as BNY Mellon but with twice the profits and 20 per cent fewer employees.One investor also expressed displeasure that Mr Hassell had been awarded nearly his full bonus payout in spite of lacklustre results. The chief executive earns about $13m a year.However, last year BNY Mellon recorded 97 per cent of the shareholder vote in support of the executive pay plan, up from 59 per cent a year earlier.Despite the investor dissatisfaction, there is not expected to be any large-scale rebellion, though Calpers, the large California pension fund, said it planned to vote in favour of efforts to force the bank to appoint an independent chairman.BNY Mellon said its total shareholder return of 39 per cent last year outperformed its peers, while “pre-tax income and core investment management and investment services fees grew nicely and our capital position has remained very strong”.It added: “We are committed to continuing this strong performance as we capitalise on investments we’ve made for the future, focus on expense control and operating leverage [increasing revenues faster than costs], and increase shareholder returns.”
178;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-03-30T06:59:48Z;Flood of money closes Newcits;Hedge fund-lite strategies are increasingly aping the behaviour of pure hedge funds;Schroders, BNY Mellon, GLG and GAM are among a host of houses that have closed “Newcits” funds to new subscriptions after a flood of money entered the sector.The moves are a sign that managers of Newcits funds– hedge fund-lite strategies wrapped in the mainstream Ucits fund structure – are increasingly aping the behaviour of pure hedge fund managers, which often close funds, rather than traditional asset managers, which tend to be more focused on maximising their assets under management.“It proves that these funds are hedge funds and they are treated as hedge funds by their managers,” said Georg Reutter, head of research at Kepler Partners, a fund marketing and research company.Closures are generally driven by a view that performance will suffer if a manager has too much money to look after, particularly in a niche strategy.According to Kepler, assets under management in long-short equity Newcits funds have doubled in the past year. This has led to a trebling in the number of funds closed to new money, to 22. Mr Reutter expected this figure to rise above 30 by the summer.Funds accounting for 40 per cent of assets in the long-short equity sector and 44 per cent of assets in market-neutral Newcits funds are now closed, according to Kepler.The closures include four of the five largest long-short equity funds, managed by Alken Asset Management, Marshall Wace, BNY Mellon and Odey Asset Management. The last of this quintet, Schroder GAIA Sirios US Equity, is due to close by the summer.Old Mutual, Henderson, BlackRock, Cazenove and Insight are among other houses to have taken measures to restrict inflows, according to Kepler.Most of the funds that have closed charge a performance fee, often 20 per cent of returns, and Mr Reutter added: “They are not just closing because they are good citizens and they want to protect their investors. They are doing it because they want to protect the fees for themselves.”He believed the closures would lure more houses to launch Newcits funds.
179;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-03-20T23:16:14Z;Fed stress tests find US banks could take big hit;;Federal Reserve stress tests found Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs would suffer huge losses in a financial crisis, curbing their ability to return capital to shareholders.All the major US banks passed the tests, which modelled a hypothetical recession and market meltdown to gauge the resilience of the financial system. Of 30 banks tested, only Zions, a Utah-based lender, failed to maintain a minimum capital ratio of 5 per cent equity to risk-weighted assets.But BofA, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman all came out with less than a 7 per cent capital ratio – much weaker than anticipated.In the crisis scenario, BofA would make a $49.1bn loss, the worst performance of any of the banks and its capital ratio would plummet to 6 per cent before any share buybacks or higher dividends.The tests were used as the basis for the Fed’s assessment of banks’ capital return plans, which will be released on Wednesday.Any bank whose dividend and buyback plans would cause it to burn through the 5 per cent capital threshold could suffer an embarrassing veto by the Fed and have to resubmit a lower request.Those requests are private until next week. However, there are clues on whether those weaker performers risk a Fed veto, which in previous years has dealt blows to the credibility of BofA and Citigroup.Analysts warned that on more than one measure of capital, BofA was close to the limit.“It’s narrower than you’d like,” said Glenn Schorr, analyst at ISI Group in New York, adding that BofA should still have excess capital to allow for its share buyback and dividend plans.JPMorgan’s stressed ratio of 6.3 per cent equates to about $17bn above the 5 per cent minimum. The bank has signalled that it intends to ask permission for a capital return of less than $10bn and therefore should pass – though the Fed can still fail an institution if examiners find other weaknesses in its capital planning.The overall picture in the fourth round of stress tests since 2009 showed the US financial system with much more loss absorbent capital than it had five years ago, making it better able to withstand a severe shock.The Fed found that the largest US banks would lose a total of $501bn under the crisis scenario – which included a severe recession with an unemployment rate of more than 11 per cent.Given the settlements and fines that banks have paid to resolve allegations of wrongdoing, the Fed asked banks to pay particular attention to litigation exposure for this year’s test, central bank officials said. Operational risk losses were about 45 per cent higher this year, largely because of litigation expenses.One of the differences in this year’s test was that the Fed used its own calculations for balance sheets and risk-weighted assets. That meant, while banks assumed a smaller balance sheet in a crisis situation, the Fed projected a small increase in their balance sheets. Fed officials said the bar would continue to rise over the next several years.The aggregate tier one common capital ratio, which compares high-quality capital to assets measured on a risk basis, would drop to a minimum of 7.6 per cent in a crisis situation, compared with the 11.5 per cent recorded by the banks in the third quarter of 2013.Overall, the total amount of tier one common capital held by the 30 banks subject to the tests fell more than $396bn, or about 41 per cent.State Street, Discover Financial Services and Bank of New York Mellon emerged as the strongest banks in a crisis when it came to tier one capital ratios, with all of them having a minimum of at least 13 per cent.Wells Fargo improved its capital ratio to 8.2 per cent, the strongest of the six biggest US banks.“The tests should be thought of as less of a supervisory tool and more of a way to say who should and should not be allowed to distribute capital,” said Moshe Orenbuch at Credit Suisse in New York.

181;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-03-04T16:18:01Z;State Street set to begin trading futures for rival institutions;;State Street Corporation, the US financial services group, is poised to begin trading futures for rival institutional investors, in a move that may curb investment banks’ role as intermediaries in trading.The group’s trading arm, State Street Global Exchange, is set to trade listed derivatives on global exchanges as an agency broker in coming weeks. It is building up its trading desk and testing its systems.Its move puts it into competition with rivals such as BNY Mellon and underscores how traditional trading relationships in financial markets are shifting amid tougher regulation that is changing industry economics.Many banks are faced with more stringent rules about using their balance sheets to support derivatives trading, potentially limiting the services some investors will receive. In recent months many banks have also cut jobs in fixed-income trading amid falling revenues and stricter regulatory capital rules.At the same time many long-term investors and pension funds are facing greater pressure to demonstrate they are getting the best possible price for their trades, forcing them to consider alternative and outsourced trading services.State Street wants to use its custodian banking business to grab more operations traditionally taken on by investment banks, as it will be able to use collateral placed by other fund managers at the bank to fund more derivatives trades.Custodian banks act as intermediaries between investors and banks to clear derivatives. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, ensuring the deal is completed in the event of a default.Charley Cooper, senior managing director, State Street Global Exchange, Trading & Clearing, said its move was dictated by customer demand.State Street wants to use its custodian banking business to grab more operations traditionally taken on by investment banks“You’re seen as a safer bet than the traditional sellside,” he said. “We are a substantially better credit risk. This way is an alternative to trading from the sell side, who also have a proprietary position.”State Street’s parent company has an ‘A+’ at Standard & Poor’s, giving it a higher rating with the agency than banks such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. Financial institutions can use their high credit ratings to cut the cost of financing securities.Rivals such as BNY Mellon have also pushed into the market, hiring traders to deal in fixed income markets. Mr Cooper said the group would act as an agency broker, trading for clients and taking no proprietary risk on deals.The group’s decision to begin trading futures marks the group’s latest foray into the derivatives market infrastructure. In recent years it began a swaps clearing service to advantage of sweeping reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. However, Mr Cooper said there were no plans to begin trading swaps as yet.

183;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-02-21T20:44:19Z;Select Wall Street banks cleared to use own risk models;;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup are among the banks that have successfully completed trial runs using their own models to assess risk and capital requirements.However, Citi said in a statement that the Fed allowed it to use its own models only after insisting it changed its capital calculation. Under the new calculation agreed with the Fed, Citi’s assets increased by $56bn and its main capital ratio fell from 10.5 per cent to 10.1 per cent.The announcement by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday gives those banks clarity on what methods they can use to calculate their capital requirements.During the trial run, banks had to show they could comply with a more tailored approach to meeting capital requirements for four consecutive calendar quarters before they could officially rely on that method.The Fed announced that eight bank holding companies, eight national banks, and four state member banks had satisfactory trials, ending a more than five-year limbo period for the largest US banks that had been waiting to hear the results.Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, Northern Trust Corporation and US Bancorp were also among the banks that successfully completed the trial.Bank of America and Wells Fargo were among the largest banks that were not on the list, meaning they have not yet met the requirements. Bank of America started the trial run process later so the results announced on Friday were not surprising, a person familiar with the bank said. The tailored framework known as the advanced approach applies to banks with at least $250bn in total consolidated assets, or at least $10bn in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure.Under this approach, a bank’s operational risk for capital is determined based on a bank’s internal models, which take into account internal loss data, external data and other factors. The standardised approach for smaller banks is based on a more simplified model based on their gross income and other factors.The trial runs began after US regulators approved final Basel II rules in 2007, leading to questions as to whether there were problems with the banks because regulators had not announced clearance for those companies for several years.In the timeframe that the banks were in the trial run, the updated Basel III accord was approved and the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill was passed, and those standards had to be incorporated into the trial run. The US also had some of the most stringent requirements for the advanced capital approach, which took time for the banks to meet.The banks that have been cleared will use the advanced approach framework to calculate their risk-based capital starting with the second quarter of this year.The Fed gave bank holding companies another year to incorporate the advanced approach in capital planning and stress test exercises to October 2015, compared with the October 2014 date in earlier proposals.Once the capital rules are fully implemented, the banks must have a minimum ratio of 4.5 per cent of common equity tier one capital to risk-weighted assets, with an additional buffer of 2.5 per cent. Tier one capital is the best quality and includes equity and reserves.The minimum ratio of tier one capital to risk-weighted assets is 6 per cent while there is a minimum leverage ratio of 4 per cent, compared to the 3 per cent requirement in Basel III.

185;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-01-26T05:57:42Z;AIFMD: Hedge funds drag their feet over EU regulation deadline;Fewer than a fifth of managers have filed compliance documents for the alternative funds directive;Hedge fund managers are dragging their feet ahead of a significant regulatory deadline this summer, even after it was pushed back by six months to accommodate them.By June 22, all alternative funds marketed in Europe should comply with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, but fewer than a fifth of funds surveyed by a large fund administrator have filed the relevant documents with regulators.“Collectively the industry is struggling to meet the deadlines, and all parties are getting increasingly concerned,” says Paul North, head of product in Europe, the Middle East and Asia at BNY Mellon.The directive requires all alternative funds marketed in Europe to meet stringent levels of disclosure and governance, in many cases requiring companies to introduce or seriously beef up their risk-management function, as well as making their marketing and communications much more detailed.A series of obstacles stand in the way of the industry sorting its act out, he says.“Some people are looking at it [AIFMD] and it makes them stand back and question part of their business model,” he says. “For others, some of the complexities arising out of the details are very challenging.”“The need to co-ordinate operations between different parties makes it a bit of a juggling act,” adds Mr North. The directive requires hedge funds to appoint an independent depositary within the European Union, which will have to get data from the funds’ administrators or transfer agents, in order to carry out its oversight of the funds’ management.Even appointing such a depositary, let alone making sure it has the ability to get the relevant data, has so far eluded some hedge funds, according to John Griffiths, a member of the regulatory compliance team at Kinetic Partners, a consultancy. “That is a bit of a stumbling block for some people,” he says.In general, however, Mr Griffiths is more optimistic about the industry’s ability to sort its act out.“We would have had them missing the original January 22 deadline,” he admits, “but that is why it was pushed back.”He expects most hedge fund managers to file applications to the relevant regulators by February, giving them time to iron out any details by June.The summary of the BNY Mellon survey points out that “close to a third [of respondents] have yet to advance beyond conceptual stages in their risk and compliance monitoring solutions”.This is not an easy time for hedge fund managers, says Mr North. “We have the terrible combination of ever-increasing numbers of regulatory requirements and declining revenues.”From the investors’ point of view, the BNY Mellon survey came up with at least one positive result: they are unlikely to bear the cost of the new risk and disclosure infrastructure. “Whereas in our previous survey [in July 2013], 88 per cent of respondents expected the cost of funds to increase, only 26 per cent in this survey expect to pass on some costs to the fund and 29 per cent do not expect to pass on [any],” according to the summary.Mr North cautions that almost half of respondents had not yet decided on this issue, but Mr Griffiths has a more robust view of things. “Firms are pretty much locked into the two and 20 or whatever fee arrangement they have,” he says, referring to the traditional hedge fund charging structure whereby investors pay 2 per cent of their assets and 20 per cent of returns (often above a specified performance target).Mr Griffiths is confident the industry would have to absorb the costs, as well as meeting the summer deadline. Even among the undecided half of survey respondents, none thought they would be able to pass all the costs on to investors.Whoever pays for compliance, the cost of missing the deadline is likely to be high.“It is imperative they address this issue,” says Mr Griffiths, a point on which he and Mr North agree. “If they are not approved, they will not be able to market in other European jurisdictions.”Approval by one European regulator under the directive will be accepted by all others, offering a carrot for fund managers to get in line. The stick is that failure to meet the requirements will limit their ability to market themselves, and expose them to searching questions from investors.“It is a very competitive environment and investors will be attuned to it,” says Mr North. “Investors will be checking for compliance.”
186;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-01-17T14:29:49Z;BNY Mellon takes blow from ConvergEx failure;Custody bank joins industry-wide litigation hit;Bank of New York Mellon suffered an 18 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings after the custody bank lost $115m on its investment in ConvergEx, the Wall Street broker that was accused by US regulators over its subsidiary “fleecing” clients through hidden fees.Net income fell to $513m, or 44 cents a share, for the three months to December, compared with $622m, or 53 cents a share, in the same period last year. Stripping out the $115m after-tax loss, BNY Mellon earned $628m, or 54 cents a share, meeting analysts forecasts.BNY Mellon has shed jobs and cut costs to deal with continued low interest rates which eat into the profits that custodian banks can earn from their bread-and-butter business of safeguarding billions of dollars worth of customer assets.The company has also expanded its retail business and offers new services – such as managing the collateral needed to back derivatives trades under new financial rules – to try to boost its income in the face of low rates.“We remain focused on controlling expenses,” Gerald Hassell, chief executive, said in a statement. New and expanded businesses are “setting the stage for a broader, continuous transformation process, which is expected to create significant financial benefit over the next few years,” he added.The $115m writedown comes after ConvergEx agreed to pay a $150m fine and its subsidiary pleaded guilty to repeatedly overcharging clients through hidden fees.As part of the settlement, the company signed a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice to avoid criminal charges and also paid $107m to the US securities watchdog and admitted wrongdoing to settle related civil charges.In November, ConvergEx hired a top Nasdaq OMX executive, Eric Noll, to lead the company and Joe Velli, its chairman and chief executive, stepped down to become a director.The allegations have plagued attempts by BNY Mellon to sell its stake in the company, which is controlled by the custody bank and the private equity group GTCR.BNY Mellon’s total fourth-quarter revenue was $3.75bn, 4 per cent higher than last year but flat compared with the third quarter. Despite its cost-cutting programme, the bank’s expenses in the period rose 1.8 per cent, mostly on higher legal costs.Shares of the custody bank fell 2.5 per cent to $33.09 on Friday.The expansion of BNY Mellon’s retail wealth management business is a significant shift for the bank, which made its name on Wall Street as the “banker of banks.”Other big banks, such as Morgan Stanley, which also reported results on Friday, have also been increasing their wealth management businesses.“There’s no question that it’s competitive and it’s competitive for obvious reasons,” Todd Gibbons, chief financial officer, said in an interview.“It’s a good business, it’s a low-risk business and it’s a capital-friendly business especially from the perspective of the regulatory environment.”
187;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2014-01-01T20:08:42Z;US banks and payouts: facts and theories;Caution does not look like a bad theory for payouts in 2014;"Returning capital to shareholders is largely a hypothesis for Europe’s banks. For their US counterparts it is a fact. According to Portales Partners, a research firm, the payout average (dividends plus buybacks) is likely to be about 60-65 per cent of US bank earnings in 2014. A few factors indicate that the risks to that are to the downside.One risk is a stress test, conducted by the Federal Reserve, which banks must pass in order to proceed with proposed capital plans. Basel III rules will be phased in for the largest US banks this year. That means complying with higher minimum capital requirements. Eight institutions – JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street – will also apply a new criterion: counterparty failure.This year, the Fed will also independently project the size of banks’ balance sheets versus using banks’ own estimates. The US central bank has found that balance sheet assets grow in downturns; in last year’s stress tests, banks had them shrinking. Bigger balance sheets will have a negative affect on capital ratios.Then, there is the groundswell of litigation in the US last year. The potential for higher litigation costs could affect payouts. JPMorgan agreed a record $13bn settlement with the US authorities last year over pre-crisis mortgage deals. At the time, officials indicated that such investigations were not over. Scandals related to Libor and foreign exchange markets also point to further legal woes for banks.In the last round of tests, the conditional approval for capital plans from JPMorgan and Goldman showed that even banks known for their strong capital are not immune to being slapped by the Fed. Caution does not look a bad theory for US bank payouts this year.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

189;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Debt holdouts put Argentina on spot;Legal fight in New York between Argentina and a group of hard-nosed hedge funds may be a game changer;For the last two centuries or more, creditors have often resorted to desperate measures when countries refused to pay up, from diplomatic pressure to sending gunboats. But with what has been dubbed “the sovereign debt trial of the century” coming ever closer to its conclusion, creditors’ fortunes may be looking up.The long legal battle between Argentina and a group of hard-nosed hedge funds, led by Elliott Associates, that rejected the terms of restructurings after the country defaulted on almost $100bn of debt in 2001, could have far-reaching implications.“It has dramatically changed the universe of sovereign debt,” says Mitu Gulati, a law professor at Duke University and former lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb, Argentina’s counsel.Thanks to the persistence of the “holdout” creditors, Mr Gulati says that the case has effectively created a new mechanism for the enforcement of sovereign debt.“It’s just like the mafia,” he explains. “We can’t force you to pay, but we can impose pain on your friends and family – and, if you don’t want us to do that, you’ll have to pay us back. That is the strategy at the heart of the case.”Not only did the hedge funds win their case against Argentina last year, with a US court ruling that the country must pay the $1.3bn it owes the hedge funds, but also district court judge Thomas Griesa prohibited third ­parties from “aiding and abetting” any violation of his order.That effectively means that Bank of New York Mellon, which processes Argentina’s payments to the holders of its restructured debts, cannot continue to pay them without also paying the holdouts once the trial is over.If Argentina stays true to its pledge not to pay “vulture funds” a cent more than it has already offered, then it would be forced to default on its debt for the second time in little more than a decade – which would not only be bad news for the creditors that did accept the restructured debt, but also for Argentines and their economy.Although the trial has yet to conclude, since the US Supreme Court may agree to review the case and Argentina could yet reach a negotiated solution to avoid a default, the court ruling remains. This raises fears that vulture funds will sue more sovereign states in the future.“It could make it quite a bit more profitable to hold out and, more importantly, much more risky to participate in a restructuring,” says Anna Gelpern, a law professor at Georgetown University in Washington and previously of the US Treasury.“The bigger implications are for countries that cannot afford a prolonged period of being shut out of the capital markets and litigating,” she added, as Argentina has been able to do. But the threat of legal battles makes defaults less attractive for countries, which will be encouraged to treat creditors better when they restructure defaulted debt.Others believe that the trial is not quite so important as some commentators may have imagined. Asked what he thought the impact on future debt restructurings will be, Joshua Rosner, managing director at research firm Graham Fisher, says “absolutely nothing”. He adds: “The judge made it quite clear that the case is very specific to Argentina.”The “pari passu” clause around which the trial revolves, interpreted to mean that creditors must be treated “on equal footing”, is no longer in common use, he says.Most New York law bonds issued since 2005 include collective action clauses that allow a specified majority of bondholders to force holdouts to agree to settle. One big exception is Jamaica, one of the most indebted countries in the world – many consider its debt to be unsustainable.“Unless another country embarks on the same type of behaviour as Argentina there is no impact for future debt restructurings,” reiterated Mr Rosner. “It’s really a non-issue.”Nevertheless, it remains a major issue for Argentina, which has not been able to borrow on the international capital markets since the 2001 default. This has placed heavy strain on dwindling foreign exchange reserves, which many believe will trigger a balance of payments crisis.The spectre of another default is of serious concern for owners of Argentina debt, since the prices of their bonds would plunge. That explains the emergence of proposals for intercreditor solutions.Gramercy Funds Management, one of the largest holders of restructured Argentine bonds, has floated a plan that would activate collective action clauses to force Argentina’s exchange bondholders to pay holdout creditors with a portion of their coupon payments, if they agree to drop their demands for Argentina to pay in full.Many are sceptical that the plan will work and some are optimistic that a default can be avoided.“It would be in everyone’s interest to sit down and negotiate a settlement,” says Mr Rosner.
190;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-10-18T11:32:51Z;BNY Mellon considers extending clearing operations to Asia;;BNY Mellon, the global custodian bank, is considering extending its clearing operations to Asia as it looks for opportunities created by upheaval in global derivatives markets.Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive of BNY Mellon Clearing, said a proposal at the US-based bank to begin clearing for customers from an Asian entity was “under consideration”.“We are very actively discussing with market participants in Asia. Demand in Europe has been pretty heavy and we have our hands full at this point,” he told the Financial Times on a visit to London this week.Mr Kannambadi added that BNY Mellon was nevertheless “keeping our options open as far as Asia goes”. He said the clearing entity could be located in a number of locations, including Hong Kong, Singapore or Australia.Regulators of the Group of 20 economies are pushing more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market to be processed through clearing houses. Authorities have pinpointed the institutions as critical for offsetting systemic risk in the global financial system.Institutional investors who use derivatives to hedge risk to their portfolios, such as pension funds and asset managers, are faced with higher trading charges. BNY Mellon’s clearing business in the US and Europe acts as an intermediary between the customer and a clearing house. Investors will be able to trade derivatives and have them cleared without becoming a member of a clearing house.Most Asian jurisdictions are far behind the US and Europe in their preparations to implement the rules. To date only Japan has implemented part of the mandatory clearing obligation for the G20. However, market infrastructure operators are beginning to turn their attention to the region, which holds vast amounts of high-quality collateral that could be used for trading.In recent years BNY Mellon has been building its operations throughout the trading cycle in Europe, opening an extensive clearing operation in Dublin and a Belgium-based central securities depository.
191;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-10-16T18:20:45Z;Shutdown to continue to hurt US companies;;"The deal may be done, but the US will be living with the consequences of the debt showdown for a long time to come, in the form of corporate profit warnings, economic uncertainty and the enduring disgust of international investors.Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, criticised Congress, reflecting widespread views in the business community, saying investors abroad were “disappointed and concerned” by some politicians’ willingness to countenance a debt default.“The fact the narrative in Washington is even about whether we extend our debt ceiling is just not acceptable. If you are a debtor nation your job is to make sure your creditors like you,” Mr Fink said. “Even with a deal to avoid a default, the damage has been done and the result will be a slowdown in economic growth.”Stanley Black & Decker on Wednesday became the first US company to tie a profits warning to the shutdown. James Loree, the company’s chief operating officer, said there was usually a surge in demand in September related to government spending, but this year “it just didn’t occur”.WW Grainger, the industrial supplies company, reported a “high-single digits” decline in sales to the federal government, and warned: “Sequestration and the government shutdown remain significant headwinds”.Housebuilder sentiment is also ebbing. Yet global equity markets rallied after Senate leaders unveiled a deal that could be put to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.Earlier, billionaire investor Warren Buffett likened the last-minute negotiations over raising the government’s debt ceiling to wielding a “political weapon of mass destruction”.If Congress did damage to the “237-year period of good behaviour” by causing a technical default on bond payments it would be a “pure act of idiocy”, Mr Buffett told CNBC.“I know it’s been used in the past, but we used the atomic bomb back in 1945 and we decided we weren’t going to do something like that again.”Market participants continued to make contingency plans for a default: CME Group, the exchanges operator, demanded clients trading US interest rate swaps deposit more collateral to absorb potential losses; Bank of New York Mellon said its fund management customers had been liquidating short-term government debt in favour of holding cash.William Demchak, chief executive at PNC Financial, said that, even if Congress lifted the debt ceiling in a timely manner, “we’re still likely to see an impact in the form of a slowdown in broader economic activity as we go to the fourth quarter. So, things are not going to get any easier and we’ve plenty of work to do.”Tim Hopper, chief economist at TIAA-CREF, the investment firm with $523bn under management, said: “If Congress and the president are able to reach a long-term deal that offers investors some certainty, it could unleash a wave of growth. However, a short-term deal that doesn’t provide clarity about future fiscal intentions would likely continue to restrain growth.”"
192;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-10-16T13:17:05Z;US debt crisis sees $10bn cash flood into BNY Mellon;;Bank of New York Mellon said its balance sheet had ballooned by about $10bn since the start of October as its customers liquidated assets and moved into cash ahead of a potential technical default by the US government.BNY Mellon is one of just two banks that act as middlemen in the $2tn tri-party repo market, where financial institutions pawn their assets in exchange for short-term loans. The bank also safeguards trillions of dollars’ worth of assets on behalf of its customers, which range from big banks to ultraconservative money market funds.The shift in funds reported by the bank comes as the US government is nearing the October 17 deadline that US Treasury secretary Jack Lew has set as the day on which his department will begin to run out of resources to pay its debts.Money market funds such as those run by Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase have already been selling short-term US Treasuries ahead of a potential missed payment by the US.“We’ve seen various money market funds and various clients get more defensive and put more into cash,” Gerald Hassell, BNY Mellon chief executive, told analysts on a conference call to discuss the bank’s third-quarter earnings. “As every day goes by more people are getting more defensive and liquidating more.”BNY Mellon reported net income of $967m for the three months that ended on September 30, up more than a third compared to the $720m reported for the same period a year earlier. The custody bank has been cutting costs and exploring new businesses such as collateral management to offset ultra-low interest rates that eat into the profit margins it earns from managing customers’ assets.Third-quarter earnings per share were 60 cents – after stripping out a tax benefit related to a US court’s partial reversal of an earlier decision on the bank’s controversial Stars programme – beating analysts’ estimates of 58 cents a share.BNY Mellon shares rose 35 cents, or 1.13 per cent, to $31.19 in early morning trading in New York.Todd Gibbons, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times that some money market funds had requested BNY Mellon change their tri-party repo agreements to specifically exclude those Treasuries deemed most vulnerable to a default. The funds have traditionally accepted Treasuries and T-bills as collateral for repo loans.“The clients are the ones that determine what kind of collateral they’re willing to take, they might be changing the rules,” he said. “There’s some of that.”Mr Gibbons added that his bank had just $60m or so of Treasuries due to mature before the end of the year in its securities portfolio. On Tuesday Citigroup revealed that it had sold off all of its holdings of Treasuries due to mature before the end of October, as it reported its own quarterly earnings.“We’re taking this very seriously and we have a variety of contingency plans in place with a variety of different scenarios because we’re not quite sure what will come out of Washington,” said Mr Hassell. “I think we’re as prepared as anyone.”
193;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-10-13T04:37:19Z;‘Pincer attack’ crushes European fund profits;Rising cost of regulation and shift to passive products squeeze margins;Profit margins across Europe’s fund management market are caught in a “pincer attack” due to the rising costs of regulation and increasing revenue pressure from the shift into low-cost passive funds.Complying with new regulations will cost between $300m and $500m annually over the next three years. This translates into a significant increase in cost-to-income ratios, according to BNY Mellon.Fees have fallen over the past decade and are “almost certain” to decline further, forcing managers to adopt innovative ideas to protect margins.Daron Pearce, head of global financial institutions in Europe for BNY Mellon, says the stakes are “very high” for European managers.“The winners will lead fund management into a profitable new era while the losers, those that fail to act now to protect profitability, will face failure, or at best be acquired,” he says.Analysts at Fitch Ratings also predict further erosion of profit margins, which have fallen from 44 basis points of assets under management in 2010 to 40bp on average.Aymeric Poizot, managing director of Fitch’s fund and asset manager rating group, says margins will remain under pressure due to institutional investors shifting into passive products and the growing demand for low-cost exchange traded funds and target-date funds.Fitch notes that rationalising the vast number of funds on offer in Europe (35,000 according to Lipper, the data provider) is likely to be a long process. Almost two-thirds of cross-border fund ranges lack a flagship product with critical mass (more than €1bn in assets). But managers remain reluctant to close funds. In the first half of 2013, 500 funds were eliminated Europe-wide, too few to make a significant difference.BNY recommends that managers should “be cruel to be kind” when reviewing their products and deciding which ones to kill. It notes that BlackRock, JPMorgan Asset Management, Threadneedle and Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management have all recently announced plans to shut mutual funds or ETFs.Costs have been managed well since the financial crisis, says BNY, but this will make further reductions harder to achieve. However, it emphasises that there are multiple initiatives under way to protect profits, including outsourcing middle- and front-office functions to third-party service providers.The fund house also predicts further consolidation as banks continue to sell their asset management businesses. Deal numbers have started to increase as the growing costs of regulation deter start-ups and force consolidation at the bottom end of the market.Fitch suggests three potential strategies for managers: developing more low-cost products, strengthening high-margin specialities, and building multi-asset capabilities to retain the asset allocation portion of the value chain.But Fitch says competition is likely to intensify as the European market remains relatively open to foreign companies, particularly US managers, which captured half of cross-border fund sales last year. It notes that demonstrating scale is increasingly important to institutional investors. Europe is likely to become more like the US market, where the top 10 managers grabbed 94 per cent of net inflows last year. For comparison, the top 10 managers in Europe attracted 51 per cent of net inflows in 2012.David Walker, senior analyst at Cerulli Associates, the research group, says pressures on fees and profit margins are “immense” and are being felt “across the board”, from boutiques to big pan-European managers.Fee pressures are particularly sharp in the UK, due to the prevalence of defined benefit pension schemes, as well as the Netherlands, where some pension schemes see costs as a first consideration and have awarded mandates according to a fee budget.Cerulli recently published the results of a survey of institutional investors in Europe. It found that more than a third (35 per cent) expected a decline in fees for pooled funds over the next one to two years.Just 4.3 per cent of those surveyed expected any increase in fees for either pooled or segregated funds over the next 12-24 months.Mr Walker said asset managers were attempting to be more innovative with charging structures, but all of these efforts pointed to further pressures on fees.
194;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-10-06T03:27:58Z;Rate setting: Custodian banks defend their corner;Banks’ conflicts with clients are under scrutiny;"Financial institutions globally have been subject to just about every imaginable form of abuse over the past six years, and it is sometimes possible to feel sympathy. As, for example, in the case of allegations that custodians have deliberately short-changed their clients when executing foreign exchange transactions on their behalf.BNY Mellon and State Street have been the most obvious victims in this respect, and their counterparts elsewhere have watched developments closely. When listening to a series of explanations by custodians on how they conduct this aspect of the securities services business, some might argue that clients are behaving like greedy, spoiled children.The provision of custody-linked forex services requires substantial infrastructure and staffing, says Florence Bonnevay, head of market and financing services at BNP Paribas Securities Services. Price discovery, trade confirmation, execution, settlement and cash processing are not cheap.“Our automated services allow customers to minimise operational risk by ensuring the executed transactions reflect the actual buy/sell orders for the underlying securities, and are executed on time,” she says. “To replace these systems would require a lot of staff to track orders and ensure they are settled, and that the forex is executed at the right time. That has to be paid for.”The question of what constitutes the best rate clouds the issue. It is hard to argue that there is a definitive form of best rate, given the range of factors that come into play for each deal.“You have to look at and understand the broader definition of what constitutes a best rate,” says James Lemon, global forex product head for Citi’s securities and funds business.“Too often the forex rate is looked at in isolation, and so the true cost of forex is a question that has bedevilled many in the industry for some time,” he says. “It becomes relative and I don’t think any provider can get you what is unequivocally the best rate at that moment in time.“If you go to 20 brokers, you will probably get one best rate – but if you go to 1,000 you will get a lot more,” he adds.And while you are doing that, the market might have moved against you, warns Toby Cole, co-head of institutional forex sales at Royal Bank of Scotland.“That is one of the reasons why transaction cost analysis has grown in popularity as custodians and asset managers seek to demonstrate to their clients the effort they are making to achieve best execution,” he adds.BNY Mellon’s custody clients have traditionally had three ways to enter into forex transactions: directly negotiated trading with BNY Mellon; BNY Mellon’s standing instruction programme, or transactions with third-party providers.BNY Mellon points out that it recently added to its traditional forex trading product line a new, defined spread standing instruction product that offers pricing based on objective rate sources where applicable, captured periodically throughout the day; daily, guaranteed rates that provide protection against extreme currency fluctuations, and post-transaction reporting that includes the time at which it captures each rate, if applicableThe bank says that there have been several noteworthy actions or decisions in respect of the lawsuits it has seen. On January 17 2012, BNY Mellon and the US attorney for the southern district of New York entered into a partial settlement of the civil lawsuit against the company.In addition, BNY Mellon says, it has received favourable and noteworthy rulings in Virginia and California. In Virginia, the court dismissed the case against BNY Mellon. In the California case, the court dismissed claims against it and eliminated the plaintiffs’ ability to seek significant financial penalties.One of the best measures of client response could be argued to be client retention and new business wins. The recent decision by the Florida State Board of Administration to rehire BNY Mellon as its global master custodian came despite its 2009 lawsuit against the bank.Calpers – the California public sector retirement fund – reappointed State Street in similar circumstances.

But Jim Cecere, BNY Mellon’s co-head of enterprise forex, points to the bank’s most recent set of published accounts for the second quarter of this year.In that quarter, he says, foreign exchange revenue totalled $179m – an increase of 14 per cent year-over-year and 20 per cent sequentially.As always, money talks, and it speaks convincingly about the subject of custodians and their relationships with clients in a way that humans have struggled to match."

196;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-09-22T03:16:06Z;Regulation causes European fund houses’ costs to explode;The costs of the European fund management industry will rise by between $900m and $1.5bn;The wave of regulation ushered in by the financial crisis will raise the costs of the European fund management industry by between $900m and $1.5bn over the course of the next three years, according to analysis by BNY Mellon, the global custodian bank, and Ernst & Young, the consultancy.This will raise industry-wide cost-income ratios, currently around 75 per cent on average, by 2-3 per cent and push up the total expense ratios paid by investors by 1.5-2 per cent.“Between 2000 and 2010 there was a really good erosion in costs as people made a number of logical steps to get spending under control. Now with the full force of the anticipated regulatory agenda from Europe kicking in, that is driving costs back up,” said Daron Pearce, head of global financial institutions at BNY Mellon, who nevertheless stressed he supported the “laudable” push by Europe to improve investor protection.“Profitability is under threat and fund managers need to act now to ensure their future business is not undermined.”Mr Pearce foresaw rising costs due to higher spending on technology, legal support, risk management and reporting, recruitment of the likes of compliance officers and the expense of rationalising fund ranges.With some of these costs likely to be passed on to investors, Mr Pearce believed funds’ total expense ratios are now “bottoming out” and will rise steadily for the next three to five years, partially reversing a trend that has seen TERs fall by about 1 per cent a year since the late 1990s.However, given the more robust investor protection likely to result from measures such as the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, he argued this would represent a “very advantageous risk/reward paradigm for the end investor”.The analysis, based on discussions with 32 European asset managers, also points to increased industry consolidation, as the higher regulatory and accountability burden raises barriers to entry for start-up houses.Another study, released by KPMG, the consultancy, during the summer also found that scores of asset managers are being blocked from easily selling investment products into new markets after being hit by a wave of “complex and often contradictory” regulations.Tom Brown, global head of investment management at KPMG, says: “One of the big challenges is that we are operating in a world where there is a massive patchwork of different approaches. It’s incredibly difficult for asset managers to operate.”
197;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-09-16T21:00:40Z;Europe: Thwarted merger raises question of transatlantic power balance;Will a combination of new derivatives rules and EU competition policy usher in a US takeover of European market infrastructure?;To mention European competition policy to a senior Deutsche Börse executive is to touch on a sensitive subject. Last year Brussels squashed the plans by Europe’s exchanges operator to merge with rival NYSE Euronext.The merger would have created a transatlantic global powerhouse well positioned to exploit the opportunities being created by the sweeping legislation that will force more privately traded OTC derivatives on to electronic trading venues.Deutsche Börse argues that the consequences go far beyond its own interest. “It is the result of European regulators making sure that consolidation in our global derivatives industry, for the foreseeable future, will be very successfully led by exchanges with US origin,” Andreas Preuss, chief executive of its derivatives exchange Eurex, told a conference in London over the summer.Nearly 18 months on from the landmark ruling, the landscape in the old continent appears to be shifting dramatically. Overseas companies have been aggressively pursuing European and global expansion plans, using London as the hub.In that short time, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, has expanded by opening a futures exchange and a clearing house in Europe. BNY Mellon, a US custodian bank, won approval for a European central securities depository.Overshadowing it all, the US’s IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) then swooped on NYSE Euronext last December in a deal worth around $10bn. Assuming the deal goes ahead, it will give Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, the London Liffe derivatives market that he has long sought and ownership of the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon. It has made ICE’s clearing house one of the largest in Europe. Deutsche Börse, which had eyed a mega-merger with NYSE Euronext for four years, found itself rebuffing polite inquiries from the CME about a deal.So will a combination of new derivatives rules and EU competition policy usher in a US takeover of European market infrastructure? “If you look at history, US dominance is far from proven,” argues Florence Fontan, head of asset managers at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “It doesn’t mean they can’t be successful.She adds that attempts to “take the US model and plug it into Europe” have “been failing” for “underestimating the level of complexity” on the continent. “Europe is used to adapting to differing frameworks,” she says.Significant variances between the US and Europe include regulations governing the way clearing houses must segregate their customers assets and the way they collect initial margin or insurance for trading.Newcomers face a serious problem in wresting business away from local incumbents, particularly in derivatives trading. Clearing of OTC interest rate swaps is dominated by LCH.Clearnet and, while the CME clearing operations are in their infancy, they have yet to make a significant inroad into the local market.Ms Fontan points to the example of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which tried to crack European equities clearing, as regulation demanded competition in equities trading.The US post-trade service provider is in the process of selling down part of its stake in its main vehicle, EuroCCP, which is merging with the European Multilateral Trading Facility to cut costs.European companies have been as ambitious as their US counterparts. LCH.Clearnet, its future secure after the London Stock Exchange Group bought a controlling interest, is taking its game to the US. It has cleared $50tn in client business since the first stage of the US clearing mandate began in March. Euroclear, the post-trade services provider, agreed a deal with DTCC on collateral.European pride may get a boost next year when Euronext’s future is resolved. ICE’s Mr Sprecher has signalled his intention to float the business, although rumours persist that it will be sold. Several exchanges, including Deutsche Börse, the London Stock Exchange and SIX Group have been linked with a bid.Complicating the outlook is the uncertain regulatory framework in which business decisions are being made. Details need to be finalised for key Europe regulations, known as the Mifid Review and Emir. Policymakers will spend the next few months debating opening access to derivatives exchanges’ “vertical silo” model, with which contracts that are traded at a venue are processed through the exchange’s clearing house.To do that, policy makers would have to insist that derivatives products owned by exchanges be made fungible, or interchangeable with rival products. That could potentially open CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse to competition in listed derivatives – and could allow others to follow the path opened this year by The Order Machine, the Dutch start-up that has taken a quarter of market share of options trading from NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam.CME, ICE and Deutsche Börse argue that their model is better suited to maintaining financial stability and is what customers want. “The question is how does Europe grow?” said Mark Hemsley, chief executive of US-owned BATS Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading venue. “Should the approach be that of the US equity options market, which has created a vibrant market for customers by releasing exchange competition but providing fungible products? This is not where exchanges want to go but it may mean that in the longer run innovation will continue to be restricted in Europe.”

199;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
200;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Banks fight for depositary receipt business;Competition to run DR programmes provides some good deals;Richard Menzies-Gow is on the hunt for American shareholders. He heads investor relations at Informa, the British publishing group whose businesses include Lloyd’s List and Routledge, and he has just signed up a New York bank that will help him attract new investors in the US.The best thing: the bank, BNY Mellon, is going to pay him for the privilege.Bankers are competing to persuade managements to approve depositary receipt programmes, under which a company’s shares can be traded on overseas stock markets without the expense of a full foreign stock market flotation.Until Informa signed up with BNY Mellon at the start of this month, several different banks ran unofficial DR programmes trading Informa stock in the US. With the move to what is called a “sponsored” programme, BNY Mellon will provide Informa with an undisclosed contribution to its investor relations budget and make introductions to American DR investors.“It is a natural development if you want to be on the front foot with investors,” says Mr Menzies-Gow, who says he hopes for a modest increase in Informa’s US shareholder base from about 15 per cent at present.The history of depository receipts stretches back to 1927, when JPMorgan created a DR programme on the New York Curb Exchange for the British retailer Selfridges.Banks issue DRs – known as American depositary receipts in the US and global depository receipts elsewhere – each of which represents a fixed number of shares in an overseas company, while keeping the holdings of the underlying shares in an account in the company’s home market.This way, buyers of DRs are able to gain access to overseas companies without having to pay foreign transaction costs and currency conversion fees, and companies can widen their investor base. Today there are 3,700 DR programmes around the world.After a big surge in activity in the middle of the past decade, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission allowed banks to list “unsponsored” ADRs even without a foreign company’s say-so, the number of new programmes is running a little below 200 per year, and the big four DR-issuing banks are fighting hard for market share.That involves trying to persuade the companies underlying 1,500 unsponsored DR programmes to follow Informa – and other converts that include Heineken and Swedish bank Nordea – and become sponsored.It also involves trying to open up new territories, says Zafar Aziz, head of DR market solutions at Deutsche Bank.It is a question of regulators getting comfortable. By not allowing a DR programme, you are closing the window to a potential pool of moneyIndia is facing lobbying pressure to relax its ban on companies sponsoring DR programmes overseas, as is Brazil, which does not allow unsponsored programmes.“It is a question of regulators getting comfortable,” Mr Aziz says. “By not allowing a DR programme, you are closing the window to a potential pool of money.”As well as BNY Mellon and Deutsche, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are also fighting for business. The rivalry has become more intense amid a slowdown in DR trading. Issuing banks charge investors a fee for trading new DRs, and when they pass on dividends.Trading volume fell 28 per cent last year to $2.5tn, according to Deutsche, and was down a further 16 per cent year on year in the first half of 2013, according to BNY Mellon. As well as tracking a wider decline in equity market trading volumes, DRs also face competition from the growth of exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to place macro bets on foreign markets, and from cheaper online brokerage accounts that allow trading on overseas markets.There has, however, been a revival in corporate and shareholder fundraising through DR programmes this year, with $3.6bn raised so far in 20 big deals.It doesn’t really cost you anything to set up, and if you want to increase your profile and liquidity in the States, it’s a bit of a no-brainerOne of the areas being expanded is research. This could include innovations as simple as Deutsche putting the ticker symbol for the DR in its research notes alongside the ticker for the company on its domestic exchange, so that overseas investors can more easily turn up research reports.“There is a big interest among US investors in diversifying their portfolios, and an even bigger interest among non-US companies in making themselves as attractive as possible for tapping into those American investors, but for an ADR to be liquid, there needs to be research,” says Peter Molloy, founding director of Edison Investment Research in New York, which was hired by Rolls-Royce to provide analysis on its ADRs.The winners from all this competition to promote DRs, and to make them stand out amid all the other calls on investors’ attention, are the companies. As Informa’s Mr Menzies-Gow puts it: “It doesn’t really cost you anything to set up, and if you want to increase your profile and liquidity in the States, it’s a bit of a no-brainer.”
201;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-07-24T04:01:28Z;IMF: sorry Argentina, you are on your own;;"Never a dull moment with the Argentina-holdouts debt saga. The latest twist comes courtesy of the US Treasury.After apparently egging on the IMF to file an amicus brief in support of Argentina’s appeal for a US Supreme Court hearing (not in support of Argentina, you understand, but in order to raise concerns about the systemic risk and potential damage to be done to future sovereign restructurings), it suddenly pulled its support.Why it chose to do so on the day the IMF board was supposed to be approving the amicus is anyone’s guess.The mysterious U-turn leaves Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, and the US, looking somewhat sheepish – and hints at deeper drama.Both the lender and the US maintain that their concerns about the viability of future sovereign restructurings remain alive. But any plans for either to file amicus briefs are dead in the water, at least for now.So the two burning questions are: Why did the US Treasury, without whose support the draft amicus would surely never have made it as far as the IMF board on Tuesday, U-turn? And why on earth did it change tack so late in the day? According to one source, it had certainly been backing the plan on Monday night.The IMF was always going to have looked a little lonely with its amicus – the US had already said last week it would not be filing its own brief. Did it want the IMF to take the flak for issuing a brief that Argentina would claim as underlining the merits of its case – something neither the IMF nor the US would want?The answers to all these questions remain unclear. Still, it’s something fresh to mull over while waiting for the climax of the case. The Second Circuit appeals court ruling on whether Argentina must pay the holdouts when it pays its restructured debtholders, and how far third parties like the restructured bonds’ trustee, the Bank of New York Mellon, are bound from helping Argentina circumvent any order, could come any time.The smart money is on a negative ruling for Argentina. The big unknown is how tough the Second Circuit will be on third parties.What looks like being less of a mystery is the impact of all this on Argentine bonds, which rallied on news of the IMF planned brief. Expect them to take a hit when markets open on Wednesday.Related reading:

The figure represents a strong rebound from 2012, when DR capital raising dipped to $1.25bn in 11 deals.The peak year was 2011, when $11.7bn was raised.Russian fertiliser company Phosagro found buyers for more than $450m of its shares through a DR programme in London, when existing shareholders sold down their stake in April.The largest placing so far this year was in February when Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov sold $530m of his stake in Mail.ru through its London DR programme.BNY Mellon said 72bn DRs traded in the first half of 2013, 10 per cent fewer than the same period a year ago, and the value traded fell 16 per cent to $1.26tn.The report shows North American investors – the world’s biggest DR holders – reallocated funds away from international equity to domestic stocks, reducing their DR holdings by 8.9 per cent year-on-year.The upswing in DR fundraising activity comes at the same time as a revival in equity capital raising more broadly. According to Dealogic, $400.4bn was raised in global equity markets in the first six months of 2013, up 35 per cent on the $296.9bn figure for the first half of 2012.
203;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-07-21T03:21:44Z;AIFMD arrives but confusion reigns;Concern surrounds Europe’s controversial Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive;Confusion and concern surrounds Europe’s controversial Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which comes into force today.Described as “an avalanche of change” by Rob Mellor, hedge fund leader at PwC, the professional services firm, AIFMD is designed to force change over how alternative managers cope with risk, sell funds and pay staff.But 88 per cent of alternative managers believe fund costs for investors will rise as a result of the new rules, while half say their business will be disadvantaged by AIFMD, according to BNY Mellon, which surveyed 70 respondents with more than $5tn in assets.Initial one-off costs for complying with AIFMD would range from $300,000 to more than $1m per institution, said BNY.Two-thirds of respondents to BNY’s survey also said that the number of alternative funds available to investors would shrink.“Many investors are unsure of the impact that the regulations will have,” said Amy Benstead, head of hedge fund products at Preqin, the data provider, adding that it would be difficult to assess AIFMD’s full impact before 2014, as it is being phased in.Preqin recently surveyed 220 hedge fund managers and found that only 22 per cent were already AIFMD compliant.Bigger companies (assets over $1bn) were the most prepared while large numbers (44 per cent) of North American managers affected by AIFMD were waiting to see the impact of the regulations before altering their processes.John Everett, principal at Bovill, a regulatory consultancy, said most alternative fund managers should use the transitional year to get to grips with the rules.“There are still crucial details that need to be clarified, such as which firms will have to comply with the onerous rules on pay,” said Mr Everett.The rules on pay, said Mr Everett, were “a real sticking point”.
204;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-07-17T16:52:44Z;BNY Mellon urges change to borrowing rule;;Bank of New York Mellon said it would urge US regulators to exclude a “perverse” aspect of a new rule aimed at capping banks’ borrowing, in one of the first signs that the financial industry intends to lobby against parts of the proposal.The biggest banks would have to hold extra capital against all of their assets under a new US “leverage ratio” rule outlined by regulators including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation earlier this month. Total assets would include cash held on deposit at central banks, as well as government bonds.“The main point that we are going to talk to the supervisors [about] through the comment period is the treatment of cash at central banks,” said Gerald Hassell, BNY Mellon’s chairman and chief executive. “It’s kind of perverse to think that we have to hold capital against cash that we hold at central banks.”As a custody bank, BNY Mellon is responsible for tracking and safeguarding billions of dollars of its customers’ assets, making it particularly vulnerable to the new rule.The leverage ratio is valued by US regulators as a simpler and blunter tool to gauge the strength of banks since it ignores the perceived riskiness of assets, and instead measures capital against total securities and loans on balance sheets.BNY Mellon said that its leverage ratio would currently be “in the low fours” – less than the 5 to 6 per cent required under the regulators’ leverage proposal.Mr Hassell stressed that the bank had “a lot of levers that we can pull if necessary” to meet the proposed borrowing requirement, which comes into effect in 2018.BNY Mellon, the world’s biggest custodian bank by market value, on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $833m, up 79 per cent year on year, thanks to rising stock and bond prices. Northern Trust, a smaller custody bank, said its profit for the three months to July rose 6.2 per cent to $187.9m.The leverage ratio has become a theme in the second-quarter bank earnings season, with analysts and investors pressing financial companies for their early estimates of the figure. On Tuesday, Harvey Schwartz, chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, repeatedly declined to give a leverage ratio estimate.The bank is waiting to see what the final rule looks like, he said.Executives at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have said they believe regulators may alter some of the most drastic parts of the proposal.Under international Basel III banking rules, “safer” securities such as government bonds and cash are given a zero per cent risk-weighting, meaning banks are not required to hold capital against them. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, has said the new rule could make it more expensive for banks to hold US government bonds.The leverage ratio’s treatment of government bonds “is an area that could possibly see some softening in the final rules”, said Howard Chen, analyst at Credit Suisse.With additional reporting by Tom Braithwaite in New York.
205;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-07-10T19:39:58Z;US banks to shuffle assets over leverage rules;;"US banks believe they will be able to meet a new regulatory requirement on debt levels by shuffling assets between their subsidiaries and using other “optimisation” strategies to reduce the amount of leverage they report.“We’re going to be able to pull a lot of levers,” said an executive at a large US bank on Wednesday, a day after bank regulators proposed a new “leverage ratio” to limit the industry’s reliance on debt.Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted in research for clients that “banks have a lot of options to mitigate the impact” – including moving assets, shortening the duration of derivatives and reducing credit commitments.Some of those steps would have the effect of reducing banks’ overall credit exposures but others would not – calling into question the robustness of a rule that is supposed to be difficult to evade.“To the extent that banks are ‘optimising’ by, for instance, not engaging in derivatives that they don’t need, that is deleveraging,” said a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation official.But the official added: “To the extent that they’re saying, ‘we can optimise, we can move it from the bank to the holding company subsidiaries’ – these are things that we have to look at.”Several of the largest banks declined to comment. However, some executives said privately that they could live with the new standards via mitigation strategies or – at worst – retaining a portion of earnings over the five years before the rule comes into force.No bank said it expected to raise equity to fill an apparent capital shortfall of more than $60bn across the industry.Analysts estimated that banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, State Street, Citigroup and Bank of America – all but two of the eight financial institutions affected by the proposed rule – would currently have capital shortfalls under the proposed ratio.Policy makers had pushed for a tougher leverage ratio because, unlike other capital requirements, such as the main international Basel III rules, it is not “risk weighted”.
Risk weighting of assets aims to force banks to hold more equity capital against riskier assets such as leveraged loans and less against safer assets such as US Treasuries.The leverage ratio is a blunter tool, criticised by other regulators precisely because it does not distinguish between risk. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the new capital requirements on US banks could feed through into the Treasury market.“Banks are going to have two choices, raise new equity or reduce their leverage.” He said that the rules would not come into force until 2018, but could accelerate a rise in bond yields as banks are the largest holders of US Treasuries and could sell, or chose not to reinvest, as they shrink their balance sheets.Banks have five years and a number of options to boost their ratio to the new requirement.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Systemic risk?

207;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US custody banks face ratings downgrade;;Moody’s has placed the credit ratings of the three biggest US custody banks on review for a downgrade in a move that illustrates the continued pressure of record low interest rates on the businesses of some of the largest financial institutions.Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust and State Street would most likely see their ratings trimmed by one notch, Moody’s said in a statement on Tuesday.Historic low interest rates in the US have wreaked havoc on the business models of custody banks – which rely on eking out small amounts of money by managing and protecting trillions of dollars worth of securities on behalf of their customers.“Moody’s will focus on the long-term profitability challenges facing these very highly rated banks,” the rating agency said. “As interest rates rise, the banks’ earnings pressures will recede. However, the demonstrated vulnerability of their business models to protracted low interest rates constitutes a concentration risk.”BNYMellon is currently rated Aa3 – three notches below triple A, the highest credit rating available. State Street and Northern Trust are rated four notches below at A1.Moody’s also warned that the custody banks, which have big portfolios of bonds and other securities, could be hit by new rules governing the amount of regulatory capital they have to hold. Under proposed Basel III regulations banks will have to include interest rate-related securities losses in their capital calculations.“The declining value of fixed-rate securities in a rising rate environment, realised or as part of a stress test, would reduce regulatory capital,” Moody’s said. “This could influence the banks to alter their investment policies and result in an increase to their risk profiles.”The trust banks have already been trimming millions of dollars of expenses in recent years to offset the record low interest rates. Some have also been exploring new lines of business, including collateral transformation, to boost profits.While rising rates may affect banks which have built up very large securities portfolios, they could also provide a boost to the industry’s profit margins on other services.A 100 basis point increase in interest rates could lead to a $575m increase in annual pre-tax income at BNYMellon, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse. State Street could get a $165m boost in pre-tax income and Northern Trust a $110m increase.
208;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Argentina bonds: high yielding for a reason;;"The legal battle between Argentina and its hedge fund creditors is approaching a finale. Few expect it to end in anything other than a crushing defeat for Buenos Aires.Anticipating its rout, Argentina earlier this week asked for an unlikely Supreme Court hearing. While this may delay a reckoning, the New York courts will probably leave Buenos Aires facing a stark but unpalatable choice: pay hedge funds led by Elliott Management – or default on its international debts again. Given that Argentina excoriates its opponents as “vultures”, it is expected to choose the latter option.That has led many asset managers to dump their holdings of Argentine bonds, but some intrepid investors scent an opportunity, and have been picking up the debts on the cheap. These include the asset management arms of BNP Paribas, Nordea and Goldman Sachs, but one of the most aggressive is TCW, a Los Angeles-based investment group.TCW’s flagship $6.8bn emerging markets debt fund snapped up affected Argentine bonds with a face value of $142m up to the end of May, making it the biggest registered holders of two of the biggest bonds. The US asset manager is betting that Argentina will default, but eventually find a way around the court’s injunction against paying its regular bondholders, but not Elliott.Since the end of May the position has been pared to a face value of about $80m-$90m, as TCW took advantage of a recovery in prices, according to David Robbins, the fund’s co-manager. But he is prepared to add again if prices fall.“It’s an opportunistic trade,” he says. “We don’t disagree with the market, we think there’s a high probability of default. But we think a negative ruling will make Argentina more willing to pay, not less.”However, many lawyers and fund managers argue that the financial logistics and legal dangers involved in circumventing the New York court’s injunction are daunting, and doubt Argentina will be able to find a way to pay bondholders if it does default.There are several options Buenos Aires could explore, but most involve some sort of local exchange: Argentina defaults on its international bonds rather than pay Elliott, but then offers creditors to swap now-defaulted bonds with new bonds worth the same amount under local Argentine law.Yet there are several pitfalls that will make this almost impossible to implement in practice. The court ruling not only bans Argentina from even considering ways to circumvent the order for it to pay Elliott, but also forbids any Argentine “agents” or third parties from aiding any violation.This affects Argentina’s lawyers, Cleary Gottlieb, the custodian bank that acts as trustee for Argentina’s international bonds, Bank of New York Mellon, and the international payments system. All will be loath to contravene a US court injunction.Argentina might be able to find a local law firm and possibly a domestic bank to manage the mechanics of an exchange or swap of some sort, but BNY Mellon’s co-operation would in all likelihood be necessary for it to happen, experts say.The bond trustee sits in the middle of the payment system. Argentina deposits any bond payments to BNY Mellon, which then remits the money to clearing houses – Depositary Trust Company in the US and Euroclear in Europe – which then routes it on to brokerages that hold bonds on behalf of investors.Without the help of DTC, Euroclear and the brokerages, Buenos Aires would struggle to verify who really holds its debts, and how much, but BNY Mellon is seen as the vulnerable link.“You might be able to find someone locally to manage it, but BNY Mellon presents the core problem,” says Thomas Laryea, a partner at Dentons, the law firm. “It’s almost unfathomable that you can reconcile the bondholder group without BNY Mellon being involved.”Robbins does not know the exact mechanism that would be used, but is confident that Argentina will be able to find a way to pay bondholders. “The important thing here is that there’s a willingness to pay, so something should be worked out.”Indeed, Argentine vice president Amado Boudou has said Buenos Aires will “under any condition, in any instance, whatever the [court] result… one way or another” pay bondholders. As one lawyer notes, when creditors are blessed with a debtor that wants to pay, they tend to get paid.But even if Argentine finds a way around the obstacles posed by the court injunction, Elliott – a notoriously aggressive, hard-nosed hedge fund – is likely to sue any bondholders that receive payment from Argentina. Although lawyers say Elliott will have problems winning, it could manage to tie up bondholders in courts for years.The potential returns of Argentina’s international bonds are certainly tempting – in the government bond market only Cypriot bonds yield more. However, the risks and obstacles are manifold, and legal experts say most investors are right to be wary. Argentine bonds are high yielding for a reason.Related reading:

210;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-06-09T06:20:49Z;Funds of hedge funds fight for survival;The industry, which has been haemorrhaging money, is becoming more customised and strategic;"Funds of hedge funds are being forced into a corner as investors withdraw billions of dollars from the sector every quarter, scared off by mixed results and high performance fees.The number of funds of hedge funds has fallen steadily in recent years, according to figures from Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research, dropping from 2,462 in 2007 to 1,855 in the first quarter of this year. While outflows have eased since the haemorrhaging seen in 2009, they persist. More than $22bn was removed from funds of funds in 2012 and another $5bn in the first quarter of 2013.But some managers are staging a comeback.First, investment houses are turning their fund of funds businesses round by embracing the job of financial adviser and building bespoke funds for clients. Second, they are throwing away the rule book whereby they simply sold a utilitarian array of portfolios of preselected hedge funds.With the aid of managed accounts, investment houses are tailoring their offerings to suit the precise needs of their investors. They are also creating “best idea” versions of selected hedge funds. This strategic shift involves being smarter, as well as adopting hands-on management.Suppose two hedge funds in a portfolio make similar trades, then the position in one of those funds might be dropped, depending on the wishes of investors. It is also less likely that money will be held in a commingled fund or even in a fund structure.A survey of 23 funds of funds with assets of $159bn conducted in May by BNY Mellon, a hedge fund administrator, and Casey Quirk, the research consultancy, backs up the anecdotal evidence. It revealed that customised separate accounts constituted 56 per cent of funds of hedge funds’ gross sales in 2012; commingled funds, once the industry’s bread and butter, accounted for just 30 per cent of sales.“The big houses are essentially managing a portfolio of customised best ideas from a number of different managers,” reports Ken Heinz, president of HFR. “They are making these tactical portfolio adjustments. There’s more hedging activity and leveraging and the reducing of certain positions. It’s all becoming very customised and strategic.”Europeans are keener on funds of hedge funds than North Americans and Asians, according to the BNY Mellon study. Of the $30bn of gross inflows into the sector last year, 52 per cent came from Europe and another 35 per cent from North America. Asians contributed just 6 per cent to the total.Interest from retail investors remains lukewarm at best. Last year, retail products comprised just 8 per cent of funds of hedge funds’ sales, according to the study. But efforts are being made to woo these investors, with some houses offering SEC-regulated vehicles and others bringing in distribution specialists to create game plans to attract their money.“People would love to have retail money again. And I think that market could come back,” said one industry executive. “But trying to raise that money is difficult. Retail clients were quite burnt by their experiences in alternatives when markets imploded a few years ago.”Fund houses continue to place aggressive bets on institutional money. About 80-90 per cent of the money Switzerland’s GAM now runs is for institutions. And though it may sound like marketing hogwash, this switch to selling big pension funds “solutions” and not “products” is succeeding.“This is an adaptation for survival,” says Anthony Lawler, a portfolio manager in GAM’s multi-manager team. “The industry consolidation will continue.”He adds: “Demand from investors is more nuanced. People are saying, ‘If I’m going to pay you a fee, I want a thoughtful manager who can offer a portfolio with twenty good funds. That requires people who understand all strategies.”This change in priorities is necessary to compete. The leading cause of the $41.5bn in gross withdrawals BNY Mellon and Casey Quirke identified last year was investors opting to switch to direct stakes in single-manager hedge funds.Mr Lawler argues that large players such as Blackstone, Grosvenor and Mesirow fare better than small ones in this Darwinian environment. “The largest funds of funds have the resources to provide solutions-based products to people while smaller ones are being found out for not having the resources,” he says.Fund of funds managers also acquiesce more when clients demand a reduction in the 1 and 10 per cent fees for management and performance respectively, once the norm in the sector.“There is pressure on funds of hedge fund to reduce fees and we’re putting pressure on hedge funds and having some success there,” says Mr Lawler. He estimates that fund houses charge about 80-100 basis points without incentive fees for a multi-million dollar hedge fund portfolio. The fees go down if investors offer more than $1bn.The U-turn in business models is proving productive. Though gains are modest, anecdotal reports suggest 53 per cent of the fund of funds in the survey have succeeded in growing their assets and top-line revenues since 2010.“The business is not dead,” claims Dixon Boardman, founder of Optima Fund Management, a US fund of funds group, triumphantly. “There are 9,000 to 10,000 hedge funds out there and when I started out 25 years ago, there were just 600. But the list of those you still want to invest in is very short.”Cynics disagree, but optimists such as Mr Boardman still think there is money to be made in this line of work And their entrepreneurial spirit is evident. To drive revenues higher, more funds of hedge funds and consultants such as Towers Watson are entering the advice business and offering themselves as consultants in areas such as asset allocation, manager sourcing and research and due diligence.Traditional US mutual fund managers, who now compete against low-cost exchange traded funds, want to get in on the act too. At the end of 2012, Wells Fargo Asset Management took a minority stake in Rock Creek, a private fund of funds group in Washington with about $7bn in assets that specialises in selling institutional investors bespoke portfolios. This follows the move by Franklin Templeton, the US mutual fund manager, to take a stake in K2 Associates last year, and Legg Mason’s purchase of Fauchier Partners, a European house with a fund of funds business, which it merged with its alternative asset management business Permal.Mr Boardman concludes that funds of funds still make considerable sense for institutional investors.“When I started out, a hedge fund was almost avant garde. Now people are more sophisticated and some want a bespoke product. They’ll set the risk parameters, but they want the managers to watch their money very, very carefully.”"
211;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors square off in battle over subprime mortgages;;Some of the biggest financial institutions in the US – including Bank of America and AIG – will square off in court on Monday at the start of a trial with tens of billions of dollars at stake.For BofA, the hearing could be the beginning of the end of the mortgage litigation that once threw its very survival into doubt.AIG, the insurer, is its chief opponent. Together the companies received more than $225bn in government bailouts during the financial crisis.The New York state supreme court will hear arguments on whether to approve an $8.5bn settlement between investors in mortgage bonds and Countrywide, the mortgage originator bought by BofA in 2008.Investors who object to the deal, led by AIG, say BofA is paying too low a price for the defective loans underwritten by Countrywide and the real bill should be at least $20bn more.The settlement was first announced in June 2011, brokered by a law firm, Gibbs & Bruns, with 22 of the biggest investors led by BlackRock and BofA and the trustee for the pools of loans, Bank of New York Mellon.Ever since, it has been snarled up in Byzantine legal argument, with accusations of conflicts of interest on both sides.When the trial proper starts in Manhattan on Monday, AIG’s lawyers are expected to produce emails between BNY Mellon and its lawyers, according to people on both sides.The AIG side will say that the documents – which were delivered after a court order last week – prove that BNY Mellon was not interested in achieving the best possible deal for investors. The trustee’s lawyers will argue that they show the opposite.BofA, BNY Mellon and the 22 investors, with Kathy Patrick, the Texas-based primary lawyer at Gibbs & Bruns, are all pushing for a narrow case: all the court needs to decide, they argue, is whether BNY Mellon acted reasonably in approving the deal.AIG’s lawyers will argue for an expansive exploration of the motives of the parties and, crucially, an examination of the price tag.“This court is going to look at the terms of the settlement and going to look at whether the amount is reasonable,” insists Daniel Reilly, a lawyer at Reilly Pozner, which represents AIG.The sums in question are staggering. In total, there were $424bn of mortgages in the pools. This is one of the few numbers that all sides agree on.Of that huge sum, the investors and objectors agreed that there were about $108bn of actual and projected losses – evidence of both the severity of the economic crisis and Countrywide’s bad underwriting.However, when loans were properly produced but borrowers defaulted anyway, the originator is not held liable. That reduces the sum in question to somewhere between $30bn and $50bn.This is where the real fight starts. The investors and Ms Patrick settled not for $30bn but for only $8.5bn, about 26 cents on the dollar.AIG, various investors and hedge funds cried foul. “They conceded a massive discount,” says one.But the 22 investors represented by Ms Patrick say it was a good deal because it was not BofA but Countrywide that wrote the loans. And it has never been established in court that BofA has “successor liability” for Countrywide.On its own, Countrywide was “functionally insolvent”, the investors decided, with only about $4bn in available assets. Extracting twice as much from BofA is a good deal, they argue.In addition, they say, the alternative to one sweeping deal was multiple messy and uncertain bids for compensation. There are 530 trusts holding the mortgage bonds and about 1m loans.Both sides question each other’s motives for agreeing or disputing the deal. Objectors suggest that BNY Mellon and BlackRock had an interest in cooking up a sweetheart deal for BofA because of their other business relationships with the bank.Proponents of the settlement point out that AIG and other naysayers have other lawsuits against BofA and holding the settlement hostage gives them leverage in separate cases.“Virtually all the objectors have pending litigation,” says one.If the settlement is denied, BofA could be on the hook for a bigger final bill but it is not certain nor automatic: another, more sprawling series of court fights, would ensue.If it is approved, both sides say they expect AIG to appeal to higher courts, but the attempt to wrap up the subprime mortgage mess, seven years and countless billions of dollars after the housing market crashed, will have moved an important step forward.
212;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-04-25T19:35:54Z;Argentina holdout saga: who has a dog in the fight?;;"Hold on – or should that be hold off, please – holdouts.As the pari passu (equal footing) saga over Argentina’s defaulted debt and treatment of bondholders grinds on, a US appeals court has turned down a request from a group of disgruntled Italian creditors.That had sparked a ping pong of filings – from Elliott, the fund leading the pari passu holdouts, and from Argentina itself.As Eugenio Bruno, an Argentine lawyer following the case closely, said on his blog, Elliott was essentially saying that even though the Italians also hold defaulted Argentine bonds and also sued Argentina before New York Judge Thomas Griesa:You are delaying the issuance of the judgment and, also, want a piece of our cake!Incidentally, that’s a delicate issue, as Anna Gelpern, a law professor at American University and Georgetown, previously of the US Treasury and Cleary Gottlieb (Argentina’s lawyers) points out at Credit Slips.But back to the Second Circuit Court of Appeal. It interrupted this little battle-of-the-legal-briefs by refusing to accept the Italians’ original request.What does that mean? The appeals court could yet ask other parties with dogs in the fight for their point of view. But it certainly looks like it is not interested in hearing any more on this subject unless it expressly asks for clarification. Leave us in peace to ponder, appears to be the subtext.The court could yet take weeks or months to rule, and when it does, what will it say?That is, of course, the $1.33bn question (that being the sum Judge Griesa in the New York district court last year ordered Argentina to pay holdouts). The consensus seems to be that things won’t go Argentina’s way, though the ruling may not be as tough on third parties such as the Bank of New York Mellon, which could find itself caught in a dangerous legal crossfire. Judge Griesa ruled that the bank could not process payments to performing debtholders unless the holdouts were paid at the same time.If Argentina loses, it plans to appeal to the US Supreme Court – potentially tough as the court accepts only a few cases per year. Whether or not any order to pay Argentina would be stayed pending that appeal attempt is unclear.Meanwhile, Argentina is widely expected to try to pay the holders of its performing bonds somewhere other than New York, to avoid any prospect of not being able to pay them and falling into technical default. But that’s a tough proposition to pull off too.The waiting continues…Related reading:

This year that proportion had dropped to 29 per cent.The annual survey of more than 700 investors and executives, sponsored by BNY Mellon, found that Brazil and India have fallen from favour since the first survey in 2011, while Russia – the fourth member of the Bric group of emerging nations – is now ranked behind Japan in expectations for asset price growth.“Investors have looked back to the US,” said Janie Hulse, editor of Management Thinking at the EIU. “The Brics have fallen out of favour and in their place have risen some of the south east Asian countries.”The US was ranked among the top three markets offering the best potential for investment gains this year by 45 per cent of respondents, up from 40 per cent a year ago. It displaced China as the top pick, which received 42 per cent.India has shown the most dramatic fall off in popularity, picked by a quarter of respondents this year, compared to half who tipped it the first time the EIU asked the question.The Indian market (CNX 100 Index-NSE) was up by a third in 2012, but it still trades below its late 2010 peak ahead of elections this year. “Among UK investors in particular their view of India has plummeted over the last three years,” said Ms Hulse.
214;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-04-22T10:49:44Z;BNY Mellon begins trading in Europe;;BNY Mellon has begun trading fixed income and equities in Europe as the world’s largest custody bank attempts to break out its investment services business from its traditional US heartland.The US-based group said on Monday it had started offering dealing services for institutional clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The division, known as BNY Mellon Capital Markets Emea, will be headed in London by Ian Gass and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.The move replicates BNY Mellon’s existing US trading business and will act as both an agency broker or on a principal basis for institutional customers. Agency brokers move securities between customers of different brokerages, taking no risk on a trade. Under a principal trade, the brokerage will buy and hold securities in the secondary market for a period of time, taking the risk and reward if the market moves.It also represents another building block for the bank’s European business as it looks to attract customers with services covering all aspects of the trading life cycle, from execution to clearing and settlement of trades. In January it won regulatory approval for a central securities depository, which followed on from starting clearing operations for customers out of Ireland.In common with rival custody banks, BNY Mellon has struggled with the effect of short-term interest rates held near zero for more than four years. Such banks typically make money from clients with notary, settlement and asset security services. Last week BNY Mellon reported that first -quarter net interest revenue had fallen to $719m from $765m in the same period a year earlier.Its performance was boosted by rising turnover from trading foreign exchange, which rose 41 per cent quarter-on-quarter to $149m. However other trading revenue fell to $12m in the first quarter from $55 million a year ago owing to losses on interest rate hedges and lower fixed income and equity trading.“BNY Mellon is committed to providing service that keeps pace with the increasingly global scope of capital markets investment activity,” said Art Certosimo, chief executive of BNY Mellon Global Markets. “The launch of BNY Mellon Capital Markets Emea makes that commitment a reality for our European, Middle Eastern and African clients.”
215;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-04-17T16:33:27Z;Tax setback drags BNY Mellon into a loss;World’s largest custody bank falls below expectations;A tax battle with the Internal Revenue Service pushed Bank of New York Mellon into the red for the first quarter, as revenues dropped slightly on the year before because of low interest rates and subdued capital markets activity.The world’s largest custody bank was subject to a ruling by the US Tax Court earlier this year that said it could not take foreign tax credits, resulting in an $854m charge. This caused the bank to report a first-quarter net loss of $266m, compared with a $619m profit in the same period a year ago.BNY Mellon has said it will appeal against the ruling. Excluding the impact of the charge, profits were slightly below the consensus of analyst expectations on revenues of $3.6bn, down 1 per cent on the year before.The bank said revenues from foreign exchange trading had bounced back on higher volumes, rising 41 per cent from the final quarter of 2012 to $149m. Inflows and buoyant stock markets pushed up assets in its investment management business by 9 per cent from the year before to $1.4tn, a record level.However, custody banks continue to struggle with the effect of short-term interest rates held near zero for more than four years. BNY Mellon said net interest revenue fell to $719m, from $765m in the first quarter of 2012.Howard Chen, analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a note to clients that “core fundamental trends remain fairly mixed and reflective of a still challenged operating environment”. Shares in BNY Mellon fell more than 3 per cent to $26.83 in morning trading in New York.
216;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Argentina hints at payment rerouting;;Argentina has tacitly admitted it will seek to reroute payment on its US restructured debt abroad if, as is widely expected, a US appeals court rejects its Easter proposal to resurrect a bond swap for holdout creditors.Amado Boudou, the vice-president, told a news conference Argentina would seek a “mechanism” to meet its commitments to creditors who exchanged defaulted debt for new bonds in 2005 and 2010. He said that “under any condition, in any instance, whatever the [court] result . . . one way or another, Argentina is going to pay”. He gave no details.Failure to do so could spark a technical default – a nightmare scenario for a country struggling to live within its means after defaulting on nearly $100bn in 2001, and a serious defeat for Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, who sees honouring the country’s debts as a cornerstone of economic policy.Hernán Lorenzino, the economy minister, dismissed talk of default as a “fallacy” and an “invention” by speculators and Mr Boudou said it would be a “judicial absurdity to blockade payments by a country that has the capacity and willingness to pay”.But Marcelo Etchebarne, an Argentine lawyer following the case closely, did not expect the Second Circuit Court of Appeal to endorse Argentina’s plan to pay holdout creditors only on the same terms as two previous debt swaps.“The 2010 offer was more punitive than the 2005 and this 2013 offer is more punitive than the 2010. From a legal perspective the court cannot ‘cram down’ the plaintiffs … [this proposal] will most likely be rejected by the court after letting plaintiffs offer a response.”Argentina’s dilemma stems from a ruling last year by Judge Thomas Griesa in New York who found the country had breached the pari passu or equal treatment clause in its defaulted bonds and ordered it to pay $1.33bn to holdouts led by Elliott, a fund which has been crusading for years through the courts seeking to collect in full.The order prompted fears that sovereign restructurings would be hamstrung in future. Indeed, Axel Kicillof, the deputy economy minister, stressed “this suit is not happening on Mars in the year 3000” but at a time of international debt crisis.To give his order teeth, Judge Griesa barred anyone from helping Argentina evade it, including the exchange bonds’ trustee, the Bank of New York Mellon – something Vladimir Werning at JPMorgan says could hamper any Argentine “Plan B”.“This might be seen as feasible to many observers if it is assumed that a vote to change payment terms in the contract achieves a supra majority (the necessary proportion of bondholders) and crams down all holders to accept the payment elsewhere,” he said in a note to clients. “But we believe that this may still face difficulties as long as the intermediaries are affected by the order to not assist the process.”Argentina criticises Elliott as a “vulture fund” that picked up bonds at practically a fifth of face value after the default and says paying it would be unfair to creditors who took steep haircuts to swap more than 92 per cent of the debt in default.While Elliott has not commented publicly, no one expects it to entertain a swap it has already rejected twice. Nonetheless, Sean O’Shea, a lawyer for exchange bondholders, expressed the hope “that the plaintiffs will finally …accept this fair and equitable offer and put this difficult period to rest”.Eugenio Bruno, an Argentine lawyer and debt specialist at law firm Garrido, who is advising exchange bondholders, investment banks and holdouts that want an exchange, said the Second Circuit knew Argentina, under its so-called “lock law”, was barred from making a better offer to holdouts.“The court of appeals is or should be aware of those limitations. That’s why I hope the [order to spell out a payment proposal] was not some kind of ‘judicial ambush’ - requiring something that they knew Argentina is prevented from offering …” he said. “Argentina could complain before the US Supreme Court if the appeal court rejects the Argentine payment proposal.”Indeed, one way or another, Mr Lorenzino acknowledged that Argentina “understands an approach to the Supreme Court will happen”.
217;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-03-31T04:14:46Z;Custodians respond to focus on price;Market forces as much as legal actions have forced banks to control costs;"Transaction cost analysis (TCA) is going the same way in the foreign exchange markets as it did in the equities market. This will mean greater transparency, increased efficiencies in trading and greater competitiveness in pricing.This forecast comes from Jim Cochrane, who started his professional life flying US military intelligence aircraft and is now director of analytics at New York-based Investment Technology Group.TCA will assist clients beyond the requirements of regulatory compliance. Their attention will turn away from the question of whether they have benefited from the best execution available and towards implementation shortfall and process improvement, he adds.TCA has been the topic of much discussion in recent years, not least because of the launch of a series of legal actions against custodian banks by US pension funds.In the vanguard was Edmund G Brown Jr, attorney-general of California at the time. In 2009, he alleged that State Street had made excessive profits from FX transactions arising from the day-to-day servicing needs of assets belonging to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System. State Street says it is vigorously defending the litigation.Virginia and Florida filed similar suits against Bank of New York Mellon. Virginia and BNYM settled out of court on undisclosed terms in November 2012 after a judge had earlier dismissed their claim while leaving the door open for the state to refile. Virginia and BNYM subsequently renewed their relationship for another five years, the bank insisting that areas of dispute should be resolved through commercial negotiations rather than through litigation of baseless claims. “We will continue to defend ourselves where appropriate,” BNYM said.These actions traced their roots to 2003, when Calpers, the world’s largest pension fund, appointed currency risk specialist Record Currency Management to analyse foreign exchange transactions. A later paper by Record, FX Transaction Costs – Plugging the Leakage in Returns, said the extent to which custodian banks profited from foreign exchange activity seemed excessive to most, especially when they failed to provide proper disclosure of actual profits. The substance of the paper remains relevant today, roughly 21 months since it was first published, says James Wood-Collins, chief executive of Record.A year or two later something seems to have changed for the better in terms of custodian behaviour in pricing foreign exchange transactions, if anecdotal evidence can be relied upon. Mr Cochrane, for example, describes custodians as “having come inside the daily rate”, whereas previously they operated some distance outside it.This could, it must be said, owe as much to market forces as to legal actions. Torben Kaaber, chief executive of Saxo Capital Markets UK, observes that there has always been a premium associated with institutional FX trading and that continues to be the case.However, whereas a decade ago there were very few platforms available to handle institutional requirements and going through a prime broker was a Hobson’s choice, now high speed and highly sophisticated platforms are available in the market and offer a more cost-effective solution. “As a result, we see outsourcing of trading requirements – particularly in the FX space – very much as the direction of travel,” he says.The markets have moved strongly to execute online, using single-dealer platforms, multi-dealer platforms and aggregators, adds Mr Wood-Collins. As these platforms represent an increasing share of the total market they are creating a rich data set of online prices, he says. This, in turn, highlights poor practice. It very quickly becomes clear who is charging more than they ought.Custodians have, without exception, responded to the challenges they face, offering more models for execution. They are offering clients the option of, for example, accepting the market price at the time of trading or a predetermined spread over a predetermined benchmark, Mr Wood-Collins states. Toby Cole, managing director in the FX business at RBS Markets, says that a spread of one basis point is not unrealistic, depending on the currency involved and the volume of the trade.The heightened focus on price has also been driven by the prevailing economic conditions of recent years. Investors who may have been accustomed to annual returns around or in excess of double digits will find, suggests Mr Cole, that cutting a few basis points off their foreign exchange transaction costs can improve their Sharpe ratio significantly.——————————————-Tips for investorsITG’s Jim Cochrane lists a number of ways investors can ensure the institutions with which they are executing FX transactions deliver the best deal.● Ask for a time stamp● If the custodian refuses one, cap the rate; insist on nothing beyond the high and low of the day● Instruct the custodian to stay within a certain spread above the market rate at the time of the trade"
218;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Argentina sticks to its guns over holdout creditor payments;;Argentina has told a US appeals court that it can pay holdout creditors only on the same terms as two previous debt swaps.In a filing with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday, after being ordered to spell out its offer to holdout creditors, Argentina argued that its offer represented “substantial” returns considering the low price paid for the bonds by the funds it described as “vultures” after the country’s default on nearly $100bn in 2001.Elliott, a US fund, is leading the holdout charge and has pursued Argentine assets around the globe for years, most recently getting an Argentine navy ship detained in Ghana for 78 days.The legal fight that has made waves through international financial circles amid fears Argentina could plunge into a messy technical default or that sovereign restructurings could become harder in future.In its filing, Argentina said it could offer a par bond, aimed at retail holdouts, which would pay out in full but not until 2038. For institutional investors, it offered a discount bond, payable in 2033 but with an estimated 66 per cent writedown or haircut.Both options came with warrants linked to GDP growth, and past-due interest would be paid in cash in the par option and via a bond due in 2017 for the discount offer.“There is no imaginable way the court could be expected to accept this. None. Especially given the 66 per cent discount offered,” said Joshua Rosner, managing director at research firm Graham Fisher.Argentina was last year ordered by New York Judge Thomas Griesa to pay $1.33bn to creditors led by Elliott because the country had violated the pari passu, or equal treatment, clause in its bonds.He gave the order teeth by ordering Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee of restructured bonds, not to transfer funds unless holdouts were also paid. The Second Circuit is now reviewing those issues.Given Argentina’s oft-stated opposition to paying holdouts whose years-long crusade to collect in full it considers immoral, many believe Argentina will try to pay exchange bondholders outside New York if the court upholds the restraints on BNYM. But that is a complex plan, and the country could tumble into technical default.If the court rules against it, Argentina, which has had other rehearing attempts dashed, may find its only hope lies with the US Supreme Court.“The best that can happen is that they can try to stave off technical default until the Supreme Court decides whether it will hear the case,” Mr Rosner said. “If, at that time, the Supreme Court doesn’t agree to hear it, it’s an almost immediate technical default.”Eugenio Bruno, an Argentine lawyer and debt specialist at Garrido, who is advising exchange bondholders, investment banks and holdouts that want an exchange, said the court’s demand for Argentina to spell out its offer after a lengthy hearing in February was “always a lost cause”.“Of course it’s totally insufficient [for holdouts]. That was never in discussion. But they couldn’t do anything else with no firm sentence against it,” he said.Argentina is bound by its so-called “lock law” not to make a better offer to holdouts and a clause in the bonds issued in the swaps meant any voluntary offer made before December 31 2014 would have to be made to exchange bondholders too. Argentina restructured more than 92 per cent of its defaulted debt in the swaps, in 2005 and 2010 and, with central bank reserves of $40.6bn, could not afford a series of me-too claims.The court now has to decide whether or not to impose the cram-down on holdouts that Argentina is seeking or stick to the letter of the bond contracts. Argentina said in its filing that Judge Griesa’s proposed solution “would cause great harm to the exchange bondholders while giving plaintiffs a return that is exorbitant on its face, and even more so when one takes into account the estimated purchase price of the majority of plaintiffs’ debt.It added: “For example, for [Elliott affiliate] NML, which purchased its beneficial interest in the bonds for $48.7 million, the rate of return would be 80.2% per annum, and 1,380% in total.”Argentina acknowledges it is the court it must convince, not the holdouts, who did not comment on the offer immediately but were expected to dismiss it. The ball is now back in the Second Circuit court.
219;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Argentina: crunch time approaching;;"Calling all pari passu anoraks.Vladimir Werning over at JP Morgan has done some helpful maths and analysis to weigh up what Argentina needs to offer holdouts in its March 29 submission to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals as the climax of its “equal treatment” court saga nears.Are we sitting comfortably? Let’s take a quick look at his arguments (see his full paper here).First a recap: the circle Argentina must try to square is how to craft an offer that i) will persuade the court it is not dishing out inferior treatment to the holders of debt unpaid since its $100bn default in 2001, led by Elliott, a fund; ii) is fair to the holders of more than 92 per cent of debt issued in restructurings in 2005 and 2010; and iii) doesn’t look like a political defeat for Cristina Fernández, the president.There’s still plenty more at stake – the court’s stance on whether the Bank of New York Mellon will be barred from processing payments to restructured debtholders unless holdouts are paid, for one. (Remember that that is what injected the drama into all this and the fear that Argentina would pay no one and thus default).But let’s let Werning walk us through some of the offer scenarios and things to watch for in Argentina’s brief on Friday:1. Argentina has said it will never offer anything better than its previous debt swaps, indeed that its so-called “lock law” bars it from doing so. How to make that offer attractive enough, in net present value terms, is the stumbling block here.2. “2010 – the remix”. Ambito Financiero newspaper suggested Argentina would offer the same bonds as in its previous swap, but in a novel combination: par bonds (ie the ones issued without a haircut, but repayable in 2038) for the principal (some $450m) and discount bonds (due in 2017) for the $1bn in past due interest, punitive clauses and the like. But Werning says this would add up to a “public acknowledgment of defeat” for the president. How close to the truth is Ambito? Who knows – the economy ministry is calling it “newspaper speculation”. Hmmm.3. Could the remix plan be a game changer? If Argentina fully recognises past due interest, that would be quite a different proposition from a simple attempt to sweeten the 2010 offer. Werning says that could be attractive in NPV terms. The problem?Is Argentina really ready to ‘blink’ in the game of chicken and, hence, will President Kirchner betray her promise to not pay holdouts more than restructured bondholders? Ambito’s article implies that this may be the case.4. Confrontation: sticking to the lines of the 2010 restructuring, or similar, in a bid to force the court to make an unprecedented sovereign “cram down”. That would translate into a NPV way below the holdouts’ demands. Default fears resurface.5. Compromise: Offering something sufficiently attractive, in NPV terms, that the court (and the holdouts) might actually bite. Sweeteners could include: offering a par bond rather than a discount bond; recognising payments on GDP warrants (that were themselves issued in the past as sweeteners); retroactive interest payments. The question is whether such offers would add up to enough.6. Past-due interest. For Werning, this is key. In 2005 and 2010, principal was recognised but not past-due interest.7. Adding it all up – check out the maths in Werning’s handy comparative tablesArgentina has until midnight on Friday, New York time, to get its offer in. Something – besides chocolate eggs – to get your teeth into over the Easter weekend, then.Related reading:

220;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-03-25T15:46:35Z;Time to ditch the CEO as chairman;There is a compelling logic to splitting the senior roles at global financial institutions;US chief executives are beginning to wean themselves from their perplexing attachment to the role of chairman. But at a few large banks, the addiction persists.JPMorgan Chase’s directors are recommending rejection, for the second year running, of an investor proposal to split the role of chairman and chief executive, held by Jamie Dimon. Separation, they say, could cause “uncertainty, confusion and inefficiency”.Well, I’d be happy to risk a little short-term uncertainty, confusion and inefficiency if it minimised the greater threat posed by executives who hold both jobs: overconfidence, over-reach and overload.But don’t take my word for it, ask Mr Dimon’s peers at the Group of 30, a forum for financiers and regulators. In a 2012 report, the G30 stated there was a “compelling logic” for splitting the senior roles at global financial institutions. “The pressures and breadth of responsibility borne by the CEO have grown almost beyond the capacity of a single person,” its working group wrote.It also estimated chairmen-CEOs at financial groups spent 35 per cent of their time on board matters. An independent chairman lets the chief executive devote that time to managing the business. Separation cuts conflicts of interest and promotes constructive challenge in the boardroom. In short, a split not only limits problems caused when a student marks his own homework but gives him more time to do the homework in the first place.Many US companies have begun to favour the governance model that most big UK companies use, even though it used to be as alien as cricket. Booz & Co calculated new appointments of chair-CEOs were down from 40 per cent in 2000 to 18 per cent in 2011. The proportion of truly independent chairmen at Fortune 500 companies has risen from 9 to 20 per cent in a decade.Why then do JPMorgan and many others not follow suit? For two bad reasons: clubbiness and fear. Six of JPMorgan’s 11 directors are or were chairmen-CEOs. Its presiding director – charged with reining in the boss, if necessary – is currently Lee Raymond. He is no pushover. Steve Coll, author of Private Empire, wrote that he “ruled over ExxonMobil like an Emir”. But he is also the last person likely to spearhead a campaign for more power-sharing at the top.Directors and chief executives also know that Ken Lewis quit as chief executive of Bank of America mere months after shareholders voted by a tiny margin to appoint an independent chairman in 2009. The $6.2bn losses on the “London whale” derivatives trade and damaging allegations that risk management failed have blotted Mr Dimon’s shiny reputation. But JPMorgan’s directors must be afraid that if they appoint a separate chairman, Mr Dimon, an executive they still trust, will feel pushed towards the exit.I think such concerns are, to quote Mr Dimon’s initial verdict on the derivatives debacle, “a tempest in a teapot”. Citigroup operates under a chairman and a chief executive. JPMorgan itself and rival Morgan Stanley have in the past taken the half-step of splitting the role to smooth the transition to a new chief executive. One of the arguments made by BNY Mellon for double-badging its boss – that a “substantial majority of our peers” do it – already looks a little flimsy.A split may not fit every company, so it shouldn’t be compulsory. A non-executive chairman couldn’t save Royal Bank of Scotland from near-collapse or keep Barclays out of the ethical abyss. New research also suggests that “demoting” chairmen of companies that are performing well undermines the share price.But independent chairmanship should be the model for companies coming to market or planning a leadership succession. The role is not hard to grasp – the non-executive chairman runs the board and the chief executive runs the business – but it must be regularly explained. Too often, US chairmen see their appointment as an excuse to exercise their underused executive muscles.The biggest problem in the US, however, is that the debate about which model to choose frequently turns into a test of machismo, in which activist investors vie to strip the chairman’s epaulettes from the humiliated executive’s shoulders. Splitting the roles is no panacea, but as long as the boss thinks of it as cruel and unusual punishment, directors will have an excuse to leave a vital tool of good governance in its box.
221;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-03-22T19:51:52Z;What crisis? Investors hunt Cyprus effect;Markets have shrugged off eurozone contagion risk;"Cyprus has both beaches and snow-covered mountains. Even as the tiny eurozone country’s crisis has escalated, financial markets have basked seemingly in its Mediterranean sun rather than an icy winter wind.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 share index ended the week down just 1 per cent; volatility indices barely fluttered. Eurozone “peripheral” government bond yields, which move inversely with prices, remained firmly below last year’s levels.And all despite the obvious risks of eurozone contagion – either slowly, if proposals to hit Cypriot bank depositors fuelled fears about the safety of accounts elsewhere, or immediately and dramatically if Cyprus were forced out of the eurozone.For investors, the issue is whether the calm reflected confidence, ultimately, in eurozone crisis-handing abilities and a more stable financial environment – or an ominous lull. “I find the lack of movement amazing,” says Simon Derrick, currency strategist at BNY Mellon. “There was a similar eerie calm before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.”Risks of future eurozone instability had already increased after Italy’s inconclusive elections last month, argues Stephane Deo, global head of asset allocation at UBS. “After a large number of snowflakes accumulate, a snow cap builds on the mountain,” he wrote in a note on Friday. “At some point, a single additional snowflake creates an avalanche.”One reason for the calm was incredulity that Cyprus could have repercussions beyond its shores. The island accounted for less than 0.01 per cent of Barclays’ global aggregate bond index – before it was ejected a year ago after a credit rating downgrade. “Between now and lunchtime, the US will create the GDP of Cyprus,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at Blackrock, told journalists at a New York breakfast.Another explanation is that a lot of foreign capital had fled the region’s stressed periphery. Investors have also been caught out before. The political stalemate in Rome after February’s election saw a sharp initial sell-off in Italian and Spanish bond markets – but then a swift rebound.This week, Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields were trading below pre-Italian election levels. “It’s a ‘wait and see’ view that the market is taking because in the past two or three years, every crisis has been met with a policy response that eventually calmed things down,” says Suki Mann, head of credit strategy at Société Générale.As importantly, the Cyprus crisis erupted against the backdrop of a global equity market rally driven by “quantitative easing” by the US Federal Reserve and a pledge last July by Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president, to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the eurozone’s integrity. “Central bank actions clearly help explain the markets’ insouciance,” says Julian Callow, international economist at Barclays.A Cyprus effect is hard to detect even in bank funding markets, which would be likely to be hit first. A sharp rise this week in the difference between euro forward rates paid by banks and overnight market rates – a measure of perceived bank credit quality – was barely noticeable compared with crisis peaks. “It was just a shiver up the spine,” says Ramin Nakisa, UBS strategist.However, repercussions could take time to feed through. In October 2010, Nicolas Sarkozy, then French president, and Angela Merkel, German chancellor, agreed that in future eurozone bail-outs, private investors should carry a higher financial burden. The impact on bond markets was incremental – and not fully realised until two months later.“Markets took a very long time to understand how disastrous it was,” recalls Athanasios Orphanides, former governor of Cyprus’s central bank, in an interview with the Financial Times. “I don’t think that the full extent of the shattering of trust that we have seen in this case – in the safety of retail bank deposits in the eurozone – has been seen fully yet.”He adds: “Financial markets are over-influenced by what happens in London and New York. There, the intricacies and processes of European politics are not well understood.”Cyprus has also revived talk of a possible eurozone break-up – raising doubt about the credibility of Mr Draghi’s assurances that the eurozone was inviolable. Mr Derrick says: “When you have seen one country leaving then you have proved it is possible – no matter how small the country.”Talks on a revised Cyprus rescue programme were continuing late on Friday, with just three days remaining before the ECB has threatened to pull the plug on Cyprus’s banks.If eurozone leaders agree significant concessions, the danger would be that other countries in rescue programmes – including Greece and Portugal in southern Europe – will seek to renegotiate their own terms. Cyprus, and the EU face a possible backlash from Moscow, which has voiced public anger at the mishandling of the crisis and threats to Russian financial interests.Investors, warns Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, have become too conditioned to expect supportive central bank intervention – and there has been “too little questioning of [its] continued effectiveness given increasing social and political tensions”."
222;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

224;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-03-04T18:59:26Z;Wall Street’s latest idea;Banks have high hopes for the collateral transformation business – but regulators are raising concerns;For centuries, scientists and philosophers attempted to turn cheap base metals into the precious gold and silver used as ancient coinage. Now, bankers are endeavouring to achieve a Wall Street equivalent.Known as “ collateral transformation”, this new business is emerging as a rare bright spot in the banking industry. On Wall Street, where new regulations and competitive pressures have hurt profits, there are hopes it will boost bank earnings.Yet collateral transformation – which involves turning relatively risky assets into ostensibly safer ones – is already capturing the attention of regulators.In essence, the banks have found a business opportunity inside the thicket of new rules designed to make the $640tn derivatives market – which was at the heart of the financial crisis – less risky. To some financial experts, it is eerily reminiscent of the slicing and dicing of subprime loans that helped fuel the financial boom and bust. They worry that the business could end up hiding risk rather than transforming it – potentially undermining the purpose of the rules that have helped spur its creation.Collateral transformation “is exactly the kind of activity where new regulation could create the potential for rapid growth and where we therefore need to be especially watchful,” Jeremy Stein, a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, said last month, the US central bank’s first public warning about the nascent business.Yet in the financial industry, collateral transformation is viewed simply as a tool to comply with new rules. The process involves banks helping funds pledge their illiquid securities, in exchange for more liquid collateral which can then be used to back derivatives trades.“It’s a new cottage industry that’s emerging,” says Supurna VedBrat, co-head of electronic trading and market structure at BlackRock. She estimates that her company, the world’s largest asset manager, will need far more high-quality collateral to comply with the new rules on derivatives trades. And she is seeking help to meet the growing demand for good collateral.Wall Street banks, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are ready to assist. The banks plan to create the collateral that customers such as BlackRock need to back derivatives deals.At Bank of New York Mellon, Nadine Chakar has for several months been discussing with clients its new transformation service. The bank – which specialises in safeguarding trillions of dollars of assets – told its investors last year that it hopes to offset lower income from its older businesses with new demand for collateral transformation.So far, BNY Mellon’s clients – which range from boutique hedge funds to mega-insurers and asset managers – have been enthusiastic, says Ms Chakar, executive vice-president of the bank’s global collateral services.“As we talk to more buyside clients we see that collateral transformation activities are going to be needed by them,” she says.Beginning this year, those insurers and asset managers will be required by many global regulators to run their derivatives trades through so-called central counterparties (CCPs). This shift to central clearing is the culmination of almost five years of co-operation between international watchdogs to clamp down on the products once described as “financial weapons of mass destruction”.In September 2008 Matt King, a strategist at Citigroup, took note of a remote corner of financial markets. While investors in big banks had been fretting about losses on repackaged subprime losses, there was a bigger problem looming.“The major question facing all financials going forward is not one of writedowns, but one of funding and leverage,” Mr King wrote. “The very same features which are designed to make ‘repo’ safe for cash lenders do tend to create risks for those who depend on it for their borrowing.”To continue reading, click hereNew rules including Basel III, the Dodd-Frank law in the US, and the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) all mandate the use of central clearing. The idea, regulators say, is that CCPs stand between the two sides of a trade, providing a buffer by guaranteeing the derivatives transaction if one party defaults.To protect themselves from market turmoil, the CCPs collect collateral, or “margin”, from the long line of customers who still use derivatives. The collateral typically comes in the form of government bonds or cash – securities considered safe enough to protect the clearing house if a derivatives user were to default.How much extra collateral will be needed is a subject of hot debate. Estimates have ranged from $500bn to as much as $10tn. While banks and traders have been accused of using derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to bet on the fortunes of other financial entities, thousands of companies and funds depend on products such as interest rate or currency swaps.“We’re talking about new collateral requirements of several trillion but, in fact, nobody knows because it will depend on a lot of factors,” says Hélène Virello, head of collateral management at BNP Paribas, the French investment bank.For all its alchemic connotations, the process of transforming ineligible collateral into something accepted by the CCPs is simple, based on decades-old securities lending and repurchase, or “repo”, desks at the banks. These desks typically lend out securities – from government bonds to small-cap stocks – in exchange for cash.“It’s not a new idea, it’s a new way of packaging,” says Jamie Lake, a former Goldman Sachs collateral manager who now works at capital markets consultancy GreySpark. “The transformation business is just going to be like the repo business.”In a typical deal, an insurance company might come to a bank with a portfolio of lower-rated assets such as junk bonds. The bank would lend the bonds out in the repo market – typically to another big bank – in exchange for government bonds or cash. The government debt or cash can then be used as collateral to back the insurer’s centrally cleared derivatives trades.Like the CCPs, banks providing the service will charge fees and take a slice of security from their clients in exchange for the transformation. The collateral comes in the form of a “haircut”, or a clipped portion of the asset’s market value. “The haircut is basically what equalises otherwise unequal collateral,” says David Little of Calypso Technology, which provides clearing software for big banks.For riskier collateral, such as junk bonds, banks would be expected to hold back a bigger slice of the asset being transformed. If the value of the bonds were to fall, the bank would be able to resort to its own collateral to make the trade whole.“The haircut may be different from what the CCPs are calling for,” says Judson Baker at Northern Trust, another custody bank. “It’s going to be your own proprietary haircut to get you comfortable with the risk of that particular asset.”At present there are no reliable estimates of the potential profits for the banking industry. But Morgan Stanley and consultant Oliver Wyman wrote in a report last year that revenues from the collateral transformation “are likely to offset much of those lost” when new regulations kick in that may inhibit some of the banks’ old moneymaking practices.“Banks are all gearing up for it but they’re not yet sure whether it’s going to be a big elephant or a little mouse,” says Mr Little.But banks also say they are wary of assuming too much risk when providing the new service. If they load up on too many substandard assets, it could hurt their own business by consuming big portions of their balance sheets.Customers may find it easier and cheaper to shuffle their portfolios of assets to free up eligible collateral. JPMorgan told clients last week that “optimising” existing collateral would cost a tenth as much as transforming a three-month US corporate bond into an equivalent US Treasury.If banks are reluctant or unable to provide all of the transformation needed by their customers, then other financial entities might step in – including historically risk-averse lenders such as pension funds.“Don’t think of all of the transformation occurring on our balance sheet,” Gerald Hassell, BNY Mellon chief executive, said in response to a recent question about the risks posed to it by its new transformation business. “Some of our role is to be an intermediary between parties where we act as the agent.”Funds with large portfolios of low-yielding but high-quality securities may want to eke out extra profits from assets by lending them out. “We might see new liquidity providers like sovereign wealth funds or well-capitalised pension funds step in to earn additional yield and provide a portion of this needed liquidity,” says Mr Baker.The possibility of new providers of collateral has elicited an unusual response from some bankers: a warning about potential risks to the financial system.“As long as these guys know what they’re doing it won’t introduce more risk. It will increase the amount of financing activity but not the risk,” says one senior banker who declined to be named. “But if you get a shadow group who are providing financing, who don’t understand the risk, and who aren’t charging the right haircut, then this could introduce more systemic risk into the financial system.”The risk is that the new business could create longer and more complicated chains of collateral, which are more susceptible to vicious feedback loops when market values start to slide.Mr Stein, the Fed governor, warned that investors who transform collateral could end up facing “margin calls”. That means an insurance company that swapped junk bonds for US Treasuries, for instance, would either have to stump up more cash to make good on the collateral upgrade or start unwinding its derivative trade if the value of the bonds began to fall.Manmohan Singh, an economist at the International Monetary Fund who specialises in collateral issues, worries that banks may manipulate their regulatory capital requirements to undertake the activity profitably. That could mean they were not well insulated if markets crashed.“You just can’t transform a triple B-rated asset into triple-A without it costing you,” says Mr Singh. “If banks do this in large sums it will cost them their risk-weighted assets. That’s something I feel the regulators will need to be mindful of.”In the meantime, banks including Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and State Street are preparing to provide the service. A recent Fed survey shows more than two-thirds of big banks are talking to customers about collateral transformation. Pension funds also say they are discussing lending out their safer assets.Mr Lake adds: “You’re going to end up with this whole industry around the regulation that may unintentionally make where the risk actually lies less transparent.”With additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour in Washington, Lisa Pollack in London and Cardiff Garcia in New York.
225;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Argentina given hope in debt battle;;"Argentina has greeted an order from a US appeals court for more information on its offer to holdout creditors as a glimmer of hope in its fight not to pay “vulture funds” without a steep writedown on their debt.“We are not trying to convince the vultures to participate, we are trying to convince the judges, and that’s why it’s a good sign that the court has asked Argentina what the 2010 offer means,” Hernán Lorenzino, the economy minister, told the newspaper Página 12.Official reaction to the court’s order, the latest act in the continuing drama of how to interpret the pari passu, or equal treatment, clause in the nearly $100bn of bonds on which Argentina defaulted in 2001, has only been made to pro-government media.Two days after a tough courtroom hearing in which Argentina’s lawyer admitted to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that it would not “voluntarily obey” any order to pay creditors led by Elliott, a US fund, on better terms than in its 2005 and 2010 debt swaps, the court ordered Argentina to spell out precisely what it was offering.Specifically, it told Argentina to identify how and when it would “make current those debt obligations on the original bonds that have gone unpaid over the last 11 years”; the rate at which it proposed to pay holdouts going forward and “what assurances, if any, it can provide that the official government action necessary to implement its proposal will be taken, and the timetable for such action”.New York Judge Thomas Griesa last year ruled that equal treatment meant Argentina had to pay the holdouts $1.33bn in cash when it made payments on its restructured bonds. Since Argentina routinely flouts such orders, he extended his ruling to the payments system, saying the Bank of New York Mellon, the new bonds’ trustee, could not process theirs without the holdouts also having been paid.That raised fears that Argentina would rather pay no one than pay the holdouts to vulture funds whom, until recently, Cristina Fernández, the president, had vowed not to give a penny, thus leading to Argentina’s second messy default in just over a decade.Judge Griesa’s order also sparked fears that future sovereign restructurings would be impossible and that the international financial system and New York’s hallowed legal and financial status were in jeopardy. The Second Circuit is evaluating his order after seeking clarification on the payment mechanism and impact on third parties."
226;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Last chance saloon for Argentina?;;"Last chance saloon for Argentina in this phase of its holdouts saga?Apparently intrigued by vague hints from Argentina’s camp that, while it would not swallow the order to pay its “holdout” creditors $1.33bn in cash when it pays holders of restructured debt as ordered by New York judge Thomas Griesa, it might have something else in mind, a US appeals court has called Argentina’s bluff.Go on then, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has told Argentina, what do you suggest?This is Argentina’s opportunity to spell out terms and conditions of a debt swap it has said it could reopen to offer holdouts payments on no better terms than those creditors who took harsh haircuts in 2005 and 2010. Or make some new offer.But could it also be a sign that the court is more divided than people thought after its October 26 ruling which upheld part of Judge Griesa’s ruling but asked for clarification on how the rateable payment mechanism would work and impact on third parties?Maybe. Under Judge Griesa’s plan, the restructured bondholders’ trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, would not be able to process their payments unless Argentina proved it had also paid the holdouts – and judges have already said Elliott was within its rights not to accept Argentina’s debt swaps if it didn’t want to. Judge Griesa’s solution put a big burden on BNYM and brought the reach of the courts into the international payment chain into question.What if, though, the court is focusing on trying to find a different pari passu remedy instead of trying to disentangle the thorny BNYM tangle? No one questions that Argentina breached the equal treatment clause. The question is how to deal with it.“The court seems to be looking at pari passu. This might give the court and Argentina an out. They don’t want to rule on third parties and unintended consequences,” said one market source.The surprise will, of course, be if Argentina does dangle anything new – and if the court bites. While speculation has churned that Argentina could seek to pay its exchange bondholders outside New York, or seek to swap their bonds for Argentine-law ones, or bring forward this year’s payments in some kind of bid to buy a bit of time, Argentina is still on record only as offering the thing that holdouts are sure to reject hands down: a third debt swap.But some lawyers believe Argentina is unlikely to be able to offer anything the court would find palatable. Indeed, Cristina Fernández, the president, was thundering away on that theme at her lengthy annual March 1 opening of Congress speech.She didn’t say she wouldn’t pay the holdouts a penny, as she has in the past. But she did reiterate that all they could expect was the same as the restructured holders got. That surely won’t be enough for the holdouts. The question is, will it be enough for the court?The Second Circuit has given Argentina until March 29 to submit its payment plan and left open the door to asking for responses for other parties. All that makes the prospect of a ruling before the next payment due to restructured bondholders on March 31 slender.Stay tuned.Related reading:

227;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-02-28T21:55:36Z;Argentina v Elliott: who’s the victim?;;"What has Argentina’s holdout saga got to do with Monty Python?Nothing, of course, but your correspondent could not help being reminded of this classic scene from The Life of Brian during the Second Circuit appeals court hearing in New York on Thursday. Except it wasn’t so much a question of who’s Brian, but who’s the victim here?Judge Reena Raggi, the most aggressive questioner on the three-judge panel, referred to the holdouts as “victims”. They, after all, haven’t received a penny in more than a decade.But then again, can you classify investors who picked up at least some of their debt (Elliott, the US fund leading the holdout charge, won’t say how much) on the cheap after Argentina defaulted on nearly $100bn as victims?That moniker might more rightly belong to other holdouts – say jilted pensioners who lost their life savings or the 60,000 Italian pensioners who are seeking $2bn and are pursuing their claims through the World Bank’s Investment Tribunal, ICSID.For the holders of the restructured bonds, issued in 2005 and 2010 to get Argentina out of its default mess, it’s clear: they are the ones who are being held to ransom.They resent being used as bait (in one brief to the court, they said “we’re not the cheese”) to get Argentina to cough up – if the appeals court reaffirms New York Judge Thomas Griesa’s ruling that payments to them are contingent on payments being made to the holdouts too. “You cannot interfere with our contractural rights in order to enforce the contractural rights of someone else,” the bonds’ attorney, David Boies, told the hearing – which correspondents in Buenos Aires were able to watch via Courtroom View Network.In monetary terms, analysts estimate there is as much as $11bn in holdout debt outstanding, plus some $25bn in restructured debt issued under New York legislation. Argentina said in one filing to the court that it was at risk of having to pay out $43bn if the ruling went against it. That’s more than current central bank reserves of $41.7bn.But how about the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM)? It is supposed to transfer the money received from Argentina to the holders of the restructured bonds – something it will not be able to do, without fear of being in contempt of the ruling – if Judge Griesa’s order is upheld. Not surprisingly, the rumour – not confirmed by BNYM – is that they will quit if the case goes against Argentina.If Elliott wins, many fear there will be a slew of copycat litigation – indeed, another holdout fund, EM, has said as much. Ergo more victims.At the same time, some fear that if the ruling stands unamended, the whole international financial payment system, the status of New York as a financial centre and financial jurisdiction, and indeed the entire ability to conduct sovereign restructurings at all, will have to carry the can.Actually, JubileeUSA Networks, a faith-based debt reduction lobby, said the real victims, here are the poor. Eric LeCompte, its executive director, said:If the judges rule in favor of these hedge funds, it will mean these funds will more aggressively target poor countries in fragile financial recovery. If they rule with Argentina, it will mean that it will be harder for these types of funds to exploit countries in financial distress. The actions of [holdout funds hurt legitimate investors and poor people.Argentina itself, could, of course, be the biggest victim. As Horacio Vázquez, an individual Argentine holdout laments:Why do they keep on wanting to alienate investment in Argentina?Argentina, mind you, appears to revel in standing up to the US courts in the name of national sovereignty. The current administration likes nothing more than to slam past Argentine governments as lackeys of the international financial community and big countries – who so spectacularly got it all wrong and triggered the global financial crisis.While the court deliberates, and with so much at stake, maybe Monty Python has the best advice:Related reading:

228;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Dispute revives fear of Argentina default;;A tough court hearing in New York has rekindled market fears that Argentina could be edging towards its second default in just over a decade.Thursday’s hearing of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York was the final act in a drama pitting Argentina against what it disparages as “vulture funds”.At issue was whether Argentina should pay $1.33bn immediately to the “holdouts” who bought debt cheaply after the country’s default on nearly $100bn in 2001 and have been suing to collect in full. Also at stake was whether the government could be forced to cough up by obliging the bank processing payments on restructured bonds only to do so if the holdouts were paid at the same time.“My impression is that we are cooked, it’s simple,” said one former official involved in Argentina’s first bond restructuring in 2005. In that, and a second debt swap in 2010, Argentina restructured some 93 per cent of its defaulted debt with a steep writedown.The former official saw little prospect that the three-judge panel would water down the tough order, issued last year by New York Judge Thomas Griesa, that would effectively block the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) from processing payments to the holders of the restructured bonds. BNYM is both Argentina’s payment agent and the restructured bonds’ trustee.“It’s clear that BNYM is on the hook, I don’t think anyone has any doubt [about that],” said Marcelo Etchebarne, an Argentine lawyer who has been following the case closely and attended the hearing.Credit default swaps – a kind of insurance against default – rose some 400 basis points on the hearing and Diego Ferro at Greylock Capital said: “The potential chances of a technical default are getting higher.”Jonathan Blackman, Argentina’s lawyer, appeared to rile the court when he admitted that the government would not “voluntarily obey” a renewed order to pay holdouts.Amado Boudou, Argentina’s vice-president, who flew to New York for the hearing, later told reporters: “It’s not that we wouldn’t pay. Argentina will always comply with its obligations to those voluntarily entered into the swap . . . Argentina has the capacity and willingness to pay them, permanently.“What Argentina won’t do is fail to abide by its own legislation,” he added, referring to the “lock law” barring holdouts from getting more than those who took the swap.So how could Argentina continue to pay? “One person who knows this situation told me that one of the alternatives that has been considered in the past if the ruling is adverse is to make payments in escrow in Buenos Aires,” said Mr Etchebarne.Under that scenario, bondholders could apply in Buenos Aires for payment. “It would be a total nightmare, like dealing with the biggest bankruptcy ever,” he said, but it could provide a way round the problem – though small bondholders would be penalised because of the extra legal and travel fees.Mr Ferro thought it was “very unlikely” that Argentina would not pay the restructured bondholders. “It is also unlikely Argentina will be forced to pay Elliot (the US hedge fund Elliot Capital who is leading the holdouts). They will pay them at some time, when they want to return to capital markets or there is international pressure. But I think they will figure out a way to try to make the payments to the restructured bondholders, either the ‘right’ way or the ‘outside the system’ way.”Argentina’s next payment to the restructured bondholders is due on March 31, and the court’s failure to ask about subsequent payment deadlines is a sign, Mr Etchebarne said, that the ruling is likely to come in the next month.“I think the parties will make additional presentations to clarify some points,” said Eugenio Bruno, an Argentine lawyer who has been advising some bondholders and was also at the hearing. But he said that Argentina’s statement that it would not pay holdouts even if ordered to “may push the judges into taking a tougher line”.One person hoping so is Horacio Vázquez, who lost his savings in the default. “[Argentina’s lawyer’s comments] have done us bondholders a favour,” he said. “ I don’t think the judges will let themselves be bullied.”
229;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Argentina’s holdouts: here comes the judge;;"The day has arrived. The New York courtroom will be packed to the gunnels – even Argentina’s vice president and economy minister will be on hand as the dramatic “holdout” saga nears its finale. The lawyering will be slick, the arguments sophisticated. So who will win?First a speedy recap: The Second Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in the case at 1400 EDT from four parties: the “holdout” creditors who spurned Argentina’s debt swaps and are suing to collect in full on bonds unpaid since the country’s near $100bn default in 2001 (even though they picked up some of the paper cheaply post-crash); the Argentine Republic, which has made never paying the holdouts an article of faith; the holders of “exchange” bonds issued in debt swaps in 2005 and 2010 during which 92 per cent of the debt in default was restructured; and the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) the exchange bonds’ trustee. The latter two feel they have been dragged into a fight in which they have no dog but where they still risk being mauled.How so? New York Judge Thomas Griesa a year ago ordered Argentina to make a “rateable payment” to holdout creditors led by Elliott, a fund, at the same time as it paid the exchange bond holders. The judge had found Argentina to be in breach of a pari passu or equal treatment clause in the defaulted bonds.Fine, said the Second Circuit in October – just spell out for us please how this works and who is affected. Judge Griesa did so in November and ordered Argentina to pay $1.3bn into escrow for the holdouts.Third parties got dragged in beause 1) the exchange bond holders fear Argentina would rather default on payments to them than pay the holdouts and they feel held to ransom; and 2) BNYM feared that the judge’s order that no one should help Argentina dodge the $1.3bn payment in fact prevented it from doing its legitimate duty as trustee – kind of damned if it does, damned if it doesn’t.Why enjoin third parties in this way? Because Argentina is a serial flouter of default-related judgments. The orders were put on ice pending appeal, staving off fears of a technical default in December if Argentina failed to pay the exchange bond holders in order not to pay the holdouts.At stake, depending on where you stand, are: creditor rights; the future of sovereign restructurings; New York’s hallowed legal and financial status; and Argentina’s ability to pay not just the $1.3bn demanded in this case but any copycat claims which the government says could amount to $43bn. With central bank reserves of under $42bn, it’s not even a question of won’t pay, it really is can’t pay, runs that argument.Although everyone glued to this saga has been awaiting Wednesday’s hearing for weeks, the high drama – the actual verdict – may not be delivered for many more weeks or even months. Still, some see the very short periods allocated to the four parties – 20 minutes for the holdouts, 15 for Argentina and just seven each for the exchange bond holders and BNYM – as a sign that the judges’ minds are largely made up.Oceans of ink have already been written on the issues at stake, the legal wrangling and the possible fallout of the case. So let’s cut to the chase:1. Has Argentina already lost? On pari passu, the consensus is yes, it has (see the amended pari passu clause in Belize’s restructuring – and note that Belize and Argentina share the same lawyer). Since the Second Circuit is focusing on the issues of ratable payment and third parties, and in October affirmed other aspects of Judge Griesa’s ruling, it looks like a long shot to get the three judges on the Second Circuit panel to look again at pari passu all over again. Argentina’s best hope is its request for the case to be reheard en banc by the full 13-member court. But en banc applications usually fail.2. If the exchange bond holders are “hostages”, would Argentina shoot? The holders fear it would, because they estimate the central bank only has $19bn available to pay what could be a flood of copy-cat claims. Indeed. EM, another big holdout fund, has already made clear it will follow in Elliott’s footsteps if the holdouts win. The rival view is that if Argentina defaults, it will be because it chooses not to pay the holdouts, not because the court ordered it not to pay the exchange bond holders.3. Will New York’s standing as a financial hub or bond jurisdiction be helped or harmed and what of future sovereign defaults? The ability to enforce contracts may be seen as a bonus, goes one argument, and the wider impact, some veterans of major sovereign restructurings argue, are limited because the Argentine case is so unique. Opinions are split on this point.4. Could Argentina try to pay the exchange bond holders elsewhere? Tricky (though some in the market see it as not impossible); proving bond ownership would require help from some third parties, and they would be unlikely to want to risk being in contempt of a ruling not to help Argentina.4. Will Argentina get away with it? If the teeth of the ruling – the enjoining of third parties not to aid and abet Argentina – is removed, Argentina could lose the battle here but still continue business as usual (the holdouts have plenty of other unpaid judgments, and Argentina has flouted judgments from the World Bank’s arbitration tribunal, ICSID, and remains in default to Paris Club creditors). What would be the risks of continuing to pay the exchange bond holders but not the holdouts in contempt of the ruling? Possibly mostly embarrassment – Argentine officials could be denied entry to the US, for example. But Argentina would remain locked out of international capital markets so Argentine companies would find it harder to raise money, with a knock-on effect on investment and growth. Meanwhile, Argentina’s poor-relation neighbours, Bolvia and Paraguay, can issue debt at under 5 per cent.Is the case all over bar the shouting? No. Judges and investors may not all have the same concerns, so in the end, the Second Circuit’s decision could hinge on what Vladimir Werning at JP Morgan called in a note to clients “a narrow technical angle riddled with subtle interpretations of the vocabulary” of legal clauses key to this case on funds transfers (UCC 4A) or on injunctions and restraining orders (FRCP 65).If Elliott loses the battle, can it still win the war? Probably, acknowledge both the exchange bond holders and market participants. After all, a holdout’s ultimate leverage is the ability to block bond issues and holdouts do have a history of ending up getting paid. One day, the thinking goes, Argentina will want or need to tap capital markets.But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Are we sitting comfortably? Let the Second Circuit show begin.Related reading:

Argentina proposes new debt swap, FT"
230;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-02-17T03:25:04Z;Catching the electronic trading express;Marketplaces are mushrooming, and fund managers must learn to steer through the risks;"Investment managers are being forced to adopt new strategies to navigate the marketplaces in which they buy and sell financial assets, which they say are evolving at an alarming pace in the absence of regulatory reform.A fund manager can no longer simply place a call to a broker and ask him to find an attractive price for a financial asset at a single marketplace such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Now, asset managers and their brokers are using a range of methods, such as algorithms, to route orders to a bewildering multitude of physical and electronic marketplaces.In addition to physical exchanges such as the NYSE, these include electronic exchanges, such as those operated by BATS Global Markets, and unregulated electronic marketplaces with lower transparency known as dark pools, such as Credit Suisse’s Crossfinder. Dark pools alone now host as much as 35 per cent of US equity trading, according to Joseph Saluzzi, co-founder of institutional brokerage Themis Trading.“Investment managers are trading in multiple destinations,” says Ben Keeler, practice development director at Citisoft, an asset management consultancy. “In today’s world of ultra-
connectivity, you may be able to tap into multiple trading destinations for a single security to promote best execution.”But although today’s marketplaces promise investors more choice, they also present them with a greater array of risks. Gone are the days, for instance, when financial markets were dominated by market-
making brokerages and their retail and institutional investor clients.As banks cut down on trading after the financial crisis, marketplaces have become increasingly dominated by rapid-fire but unpredictable high-frequency traders – the likes of Knight Capital, which was recently sold to competitor Getco following a giant trading glitch.High-frequency traders are now responsible for 75 per cent of equity trading alone, according to Tabb Group research cited in a recent BNY Mellon report on the subject.High-frequency traders are under no obligation to make markets. If they withdraw, go bust or, in Knight’s case, suffer system errors, they can create sudden liquidity droughts or “flash crashes”. But because they provide so much liquidity to the market, in the form of a constant frenzy of trading, Mr Saluzzi says marketplaces pay them and offer them advance trading information in return for their participation. This gives them what some might say is an unfair advantage over asset managers and institutional investors. In a less transparent exchange such as a dark pool, Mr Saluzzi says this can be a “toxic” combination.The results is that asset managers are taking trading matters into their own hands, quizzing brokers and scrutinising marketplaces with increasing care. As Lynn Challenger, managing director of trading at BNY Mellon subsidiary Mellon Capital Management, puts it: “What we do on our side is take ownership of the trade.”For the asset managers, the first step should be to identify which marketplaces brokers route their orders to. Asset managers can access the relevant information using trading reports from Transaction Auditing Group, or TAG reports, according to Mr Saluzzi.The second step is to understand whether a marketplace is paying a broker to route orders to it. Just as some marketplaces pay high-frequency traders for their participation, so some offer rebates to brokers to route clients’ orders towards them. Brokers’ algorithms may route orders to venues that pay high rebates to brokers, but are more “toxic” for their clients, Mr Saluzzi says. He points out that asset managers can ask the brokers to adjust their algorithms so they do not route to unsuitable venues.The third step is to assess the quality of a venue and its suitability for trades. With more than 60 trading venues live in the US alone, most asset managers will need to use external research to cover the market, according to Mr Challenger.“It’s one reason we have a relationship with Themis and the big brokers,” she says.The fourth step is to understand how the participants at a venue behave and how to programme a trading strategy accordingly. Investors normally try to drip feed trades into the market to avoid moving the price of the asset they are buying too significantly. But high-frequency traders render this technique useless, according to Mr Challenger and Mr Saluzzi, since they receive advance information about what orders have just been placed in the market and can act on even the slightest movement within a fraction of a
second.Mr Challenger says asset managers can respond to this in various ways. First, they can break up their orders into ever-tinier sizes to avoid detection – the average order size now is 290 shares, the BNY Mellon report says. As high-
frequency trading programmes become more sophisticated, however, they may be able to sniff out even these trades.Mr Challenger says asset managers can attempt the opposite tactic and deal in a single block. However, block trading has become increasingly rare over the past decade, as algorithms have split orders into smaller sizes. In data spanning the end of 2003 to the end of 2011, block trades went from constituting 30 per cent of NYSE trades to 5 per cent, according to a Morgan Stanley paper.Alternatively, asset managers can use crossing networks, where one asset manager trades directly with another. However, Mr Challenger says not all crossing networks have instant appeal for asset managers. One leader in this field has been BlackRock, and as Mr Challenger puts it: “I philosophically have a problem with using a competitor’s crossing network and where that goes.”Asset managers can additionally programme strategies to systematically take advantage of anomalous swings in the market, as the BNY Mellon paper points out. But asset managers may also be competing with the dreaded high-frequency traders to find them.As for flash crashes, a human trader can dismiss these incidents as obvious outliers, but machines need to be programmed to spot them and withdraw from trading if necessary. “We look at building price sensitivity into our algorithms,” Mr Challenger says. Mellon also watches for wavering volume in the markets, and ways in which a wobble in one asset class can influence the price of others.Despite its complexity, this task of adapting to the new trading world has become even more urgent for asset managers because it does not look like authorities will reform marketplaces any time soon, or impose stringent obligations on high-frequency traders and other substitutes for market-making brokerage desks.“Regulators should put more stringent obligations on market makers,” Mr Saluzzi says. “They should give you some obligation to be there when times get tough.”But although financial risk has become a politically charged topic after the crisis, rule changes may be slowed by industry lobbying, according to Mr Challenger.The general advice to asset managers is to act now, rather than hold their breath for the reform effort. “Politically it’s going to be really hard.A lot of money has been invested in the market structure. A lot of firms are making money on it,” Mr Challenger says. “It’s more like a glacier than a mudslide.”

231;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-02-12T18:14:47Z;Court bars BNY Mellon tax credits claim;;Bank of New York Mellon has been barred from claiming millions of dollars of foreign tax credits arranged by British bank Barclays in a complex deal known as Stars, after a decision from a US tax court.The government’s lawsuit against BNY Mellon is the first Stars case to go trial, and Monday’s decision by the tax court could lead to similar charges at other US banks, if upheld.The US Internal Revenue Service has sought to revoke the tax benefits claimed by six US financial institutions through the Barclays-arranged deals, Stars, or structured trust advantage repackaged securities.BNY Mellon said it expected to take an $850m charge after the tax court ruling, although it intends to appeal against the court’s decision.“We continue to believe the tax treatment of the transaction was consistent with statutory and judicial authority existing at the time,” the bank said in a statement.The IRS has claimed that the complex, cross-border deals Barclays helped structure for the banks amounted to tax shelters that exploited loopholes between US and UK laws.The court rejected BNY Mellon’s argument that Stars was a lawful way for the custodian bank to obtain low-cost financing.“The Stars transaction was a complicated scheme centred around arbitraging domestic and foreign tax law inconsistencies,” the court said.“Congress did not intend to provide foreign tax credits for trans­actions such as Stars.” The Stars deals worked by arbitraging asymmetries between the US and UK tax systems, in effect allowing the banks to “double-dip” foreign tax credits, the IRS has claimed. Legal arguments centred on whether the series of offshore vehicles and trusts set up by BNY Mellon and Barclays had “economic substance”.“This is clearly the right result,” said Reuven Avi-Yonah, head of the international tax programme at the University of Michigan Law School. “The foreign tax credit was intended to prevent double taxation. There is no double taxation when the party claiming the credit does not bear the economic burden of the tax.”He added: “I am less sure that economic substance is the best way of getting there because the doctrine is inherently manipulable.”Six US banks took part in Stars deals arranged by Barclays, with help from accounting group KPMG, between 1999 and 2006. They are BNY Mellon, BB&T, Sovereign, now part of Santander, Wells Fargo, Wachovia. and WaMu, which settled in bankruptcy court.
232;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-02-03T23:23:45Z;Argentina proposes new debt swap;;Argentina has told a US appeals court due to rule on whether it must pay more than $1bn to holders of its defaulted debt that its central bank reserves are not an “open till” and the fairest solution to a case that threatens to trigger a fresh sovereign default would be a new debt swap on the same terms as its last.A group of holders of bonds issued when Argentina restructured almost all of its defaulted debt in 2005 and 2010 said in a separate filing to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Friday that institutions with some $500m in judgments and claims against Argentina were indeed prepared to entertain a new offer of a debt swap.The group named Gramercy, BNP Paribas and Grantham, Mayo Van Otterloo & Co as among those ready to discuss a swap.The court is reviewing Judge Thomas Griesa’s order last November that Argentina pay $1.33bn to so-called “holdout” creditors led by Elliott, a fund, under the pari passu or “equal treatment” clause in their defaulted bonds.The judge said the clause required payment in one lump sum to the holdouts at the same time as when holders of restructured debt are paid. Anyone helping Argentina evade the order, including the restructured bonds’ trustee, the Bank of New York Mellon, would be in contempt of court, the judge said.That raised fears that, with a gun to its head, Argentina might pay no one – triggering a fresh default 12 years after it halted payments on nearly $100bn. It remains locked out of international capital markets and the International Monetary Fund last week began censure proceedings over its faulty official statistics.Buenos Aires argues that it restructured nearly 93 per cent of its defaulted debt in 2005 and 2010 in a proof of good faith and calls “holdouts” like Elliott “vultures”.The Second Circuit has called a hearing for February 27, but both sides will have just 15 minutes each, according to court papers, leading all parties involved to submit requests for longer oral arguments.Eugenio Bruno, an Argentine lawyer advising some bondholders, said that this short hearing “gave the impression the court already knew what they were going to decide so [the parties] are scared. No one knows who is going to win”.Argentina on Friday claimed that it could not just dip into its central bank reserves to pay, telling the court that upholding Judge Griesa’s order would “open the door to potential claims by holders of more than $43bn in principal and interest of both defaulted and restructured Argentine debt, an amount greater than the reserves”.Argentina has $42.7bn in reserves but argued that it is “not an open till to pay plaintiffs and other claimants at the order of US courts”.Argentina is facing other legal challenges, such as that by a group of Italian holdouts at the World Bank’s arbitration tribunal, ICSID, and fears a wave of copycat litigation if Elliott wins.Exchange bondholders (EBH) told the court in a separate filing that Argentina only had about $19bn of reserves actually available, outstripping some $26.5bn owed to creditors and $23.6bn in likely claims if Judge Griesa’s order were upheld.“Any actual claim to ‘equal treatment’ would be satisfied by treating all holdout creditors on the same terms as the participants in the Republic’s 2010 exchange offer. Anything else is not equal treatment,” Argentina said.The EBH said Gramercy “would participate in the new exchange” if some technicalities regarding underlying collateral could be overcome, and the other institutions it listed “would also be willing, subject to a review of the final terms, to participate in a reopening of the 2005 exchange”.
233;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-02-03T03:18:58Z;Bridgewater deal is tip of risk iceberg;Hedge fund manager’s move highlights operational threats;Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund manager, surprised the investment world last month when it hired a second administrator, Northern Trust, to duplicate and back up the work of its existing provider BNY Mellon across its portfolios.The move is unprecedented and, most likely, highly expensive. It also illustrates the pressure on asset managers to provide total security for their operations, particularly as technology develops at a lightning pace and hackers, fraudsters and bugs threaten firms. Since the financial crisis, there has been plenty of discussion about investment and counterparty risk, but less about assessing operational exposure.Asset managers require technology to execute most of their core operations, including handling clients’ money and data, analysing and trading the markets, and settling, accounting for and reporting transactions. The risks to these operations can be micro in nature, as when a technology system or provider fails or its security is breached, or macro, as when the workings of an entire financial system or trading network are compromised.“Expansion of counterparty risk beyond financial transactions, looking at operational counterparties and representing and quantifying that risk is a focus for our clients,” says Ben Keeler, practice development director at investment management consultancy Citisoft. “The large global firms have been out ahead on this for quite a while, but it’s also coming back to small and medium-sized firms.”Although firms have tightened up security since the financial crisis, they have had to fend off numerous operational threats. In 2010, the US stock market suffered a “ flash crash” that briefly reduced the listed worth of huge companies to almost zero.In 2011, UBS uncovered a multibillion-dollar fraud involving trader Kweku Adoboli. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, it caused power cuts all over Wall Street. This year, rumours of hacking have continued to plague US banks following repeated website outages.On a micro level, the first step a firm can take to reduce these problems is to broaden the number of technology providers it uses in case one of them is hit. However, not many have adopted Bridgewater’s “doubling up” in any part of their business, let alone all of it.“Few have taken the step of employing multiple providers as a fail-safe. Some firms have adopted a strategy where they use different providers for different parts of their business,” says Mr Keeler.If a technology system fails, it can take a while to find an alternative provider, says Sam Auxier, principal at audit and consulting giant Deloitte. “At certain points in the value chain there are minimal plans for real back-up. Asset managers are very exposed to software vendors.”Storing back-up software and data in a remotely held cloud – effectively a physical off-site server – is becoming the industry’s solution to this problem, according to Lyn Marcrum, senior analyst at consultancy Aite Group.However, the security of the back-up is only as good as the server or location in which the server is housed. If the server is compromised, or the location experiences a fault or natural disaster, firms can find that their fallback disappears. “The back-up is crossed fingers in many cases,” says Ms Marcrum.And although remote computing solves a number of problems for the industry, such as backing up software and data, it is also creating them, according to Jim Petitto and Deborah Cicerone, managing directors at Beacon Consulting Group. They cite not only cloud computing as a threat to security, but also mobile computing. On top of this, companies have to handle systemic threats such as “flash crashes” or the failure of a globally significant operational service provider. Automatic trading systems must be programmed to stop trading when the market exhibits extreme behaviour, and asset managers must assess the trickle down impact of the bankruptcy of a giant outsourced service provider.Operational issues such as these are no longer simple “business risks” for asset managers. Despite widespread reform since the financial crisis, authorities are sensing systems are still flawed.In a letter to chief executives published in December last year, the UK’s Financial Services Authority warned: “Some firms appear to rely on the fact that the outsource service provider is a large financial institution which regulators might look to rescue using public funds. We are concerned that this approach lacks prudence.”As asset managers’ operations come under increasing strain, regulators are starting to apply their own pressure as well.This article also appears in Fundfire, a Financial Times service
234;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Conscientious objectors unlikely in currency war;;Why do countries such as China and the US manipulate their exchange rate? The answer is simple. Because they can.And why do other countries shout about “currency wars” and complain bitterly about the manipulation? Because they cannot.Bear this in mind when surveying the battlefield of the latest “currency wars”. Japan is making an aggressive attempt to force down its currency, the yen, which has been artificially strong ever since the credit crisis peaked in 2008. This has sparked complaints from many countries, and understandably so. A weaker yen makes Japan’s exports that much cheaper and more competitive in foreign markets.South Korea, another important far-eastern exporter, may provide the best example. The won has appreciated a cool 30 per cent against the yen since last June. This helps explain why the Korean stock market has been one of the few to miss out on the rally of the past few weeks.Japan is not alone, of course. The newly aggressive approach to monetary policy at the Bank of England, heralded by its incoming governor, Mark Carney, suggests that the pound may also soon be allowed to devalue. The Swiss National Bank has long been explicitly capping the rate of the Swiss franc against the euro in a bid to stop it from growing too overvalued.Previous rounds of “currency wars” (a term coined by a Brazilian finance minister) have seen attempts to limit capital inflows by large emerging market exporters, which stand to lose most from an appreciating currency, such as Brazil and South Korea.But Simon Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London, points out that since Japan set its current course at the end of last year there has been no complaint from the US or China. And there is good reason for this. Both have successfully manipulated their currencies in the past decade. Neither now feels the need to complain.The chart shows the dollar’s performance against other currencies weighted by the amount of trade they do with the US, in both real (accounting for different inflation rates) and nominal terms. It shows that the US is the hands-down winner so far.Since the 1985 Plaza Accord, when a group of leading countries agreed to intervene to weaken the dollar, the greenback has fallen 33 per cent (31 per cent in real terms). Intriguingly, it is almost impossible to distinguish between that deliberate devaluation and the devaluation that started in 2002, when the US said it wanted a “strong dollar”.That devaluation has continued with only a brief interruption for the credit crisis. It started when the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan cut rates after the collapse of the dotcom bubble. Lower rates weakened the dollar by making it profitable for traders to park their cash in other currencies. Easy monetary policy since the crisis has further weakened the dollar – and enabled the quiet rebirth of US manufacturing.Meanwhile, China explicitly held its currency, the renminbi, within a tight range against the dollar for most of the past decade. While the dollar was weakening, this automatically weakened the renminbi, bolstering China’s competitiveness against other countries.Beijing’s reserves are so large that any move displaces currencies beyond the dollar. Thus, in 2008, when it stopped a gradual rise against the dollar but let the renminbi keep rising against other currencies, the dollar shot upwards, wrongfooting investors and policy makers across the world.Since 2010, Mr Derrick points out, the euro’s moves have coincided exactly with shifts in China’s reserves. When these rise, China sells some dollars to buy euros – and the euro rises.Judging by recent pronouncements, Beijing is happy to let the renminbi rise. It is making it easier for capital to flow into the country, reducing its control over the currency, and it seems to have stemmed the rise in its reserves. Because Chinese inflation is higher than that of its competitors, this has reduced its competitiveness, but that may be deliberate, as the country wants to encourage internal growth, rather than exports.So this bout of currency wars may be different, as China and the US start from a strong position. That is good for Japan’s hopes to weaken the yen.But the most likely long-term winners of any currency war remain those with the power to win one. The large exporting emerging markets that lack Japan’s power to push down their rates will probably suffer.The likeliest losers are those that do not want to fight. That implies more strengthening for the euro, as the European Central Bank, alone among the big central banks, withdraws its stimulus by reducing the assets it holds.A stronger euro would not help the eurozone’s chances of emerging from recession. The ECB may yet have to join in the currency wars before they are over.
235;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Wall St softens despite robust bank results;;US equity markets were mixed on Wednesday as investors greeted a batch of strong earnings results from some of Wall Street’s leading banks with muted enthusiasm.The benchmark S&P 500 rose fractionally to 1,472.63 as most sectors on the index finished in negative territory.Financial sector stocks saw limited gains and rose just 0.1 per cent despite robust results from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, which reported their performance for the final three months of last year on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs rallied after the investment bank said quarterly net profits nearly tripled to $2.8bn. The results, which were helped by growth in the bank’s lending business, were the best for the bank since the first quarter of 2010. Shares in the company rose 4 per cent to $141.09, reaching their highest mark since May 2011.Roger Freeman, analyst at Barclays, said in spite of recent strength Goldman’s stock still looked attractively priced relative to the value of its assets. He added: “That said, macro conditions still remain somewhat murky, and core activity-based revenues still need to move higher.”Gains for JPMorgan Chase were more tempered as its shares climbed 1 per cent to $46.82. The bank’s stock had traded lower for much of the morning even as its fourth-quarter results comfortably beat consensus estimates.JPMorgan said it had decided to halve the bonus for its chief executive Jamie Dimon, for management shortcomings that allowed the bank to suffer more than $6bn in trading losses last year.Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank, reported a 23 per cent jump in fourth-quarter earnings. But its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $26.04 as analysts said the low interest rate environment would continue to hamper the bank’s performance.Northern Trust Corp, the investment management company, lost 5.7 per cent to $49.78 as it fell short of analysts’ consensus profit forecasts due to weakness in its foreign exchange trading income.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 13,511.23 as the blue-chip index was dragged lower by losses in Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer.Boeing dropped 3.4 per cent to $74.34 after it suffered another setback when one of its new Dreamliner 787 planes was forced to make an emergency landing shortly after take-off in Japan.The move sparked a decision by Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways to ground their entire fleets of the Boeing aircraft for inspection. Analysts warned that shares would experience further near-term weakness as investigations into the incidents continue.The Dow Transportation index has set a record high for the second day running, and its 6.4 per cent gain for the year to date outsripped the main equity benchmarks. Transportation companies are seen as a barometer of the broader economy’s future performance.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.2 per cent to 3,117.54. Apple, which had fallen by more than a quarter from its September high, recovered 4.2 per cent to $506.09. The iPhone maker had come under increased pressure during the previous two trading sessions on worries that demand for its smartphone was waning.Dell remained volatile and fell 4.3 per cent to $12.61 as investors speculated on reports that the company may be taken private by Silver Lake Partners, a tech-focused buyout group.Research In Motion rose 1.8 per cent to $14.74, adding to its recent run ahead of the release of its latest smartphone.Genworth Financial, the life insurer, soared after it announced plans to spin off its mortgage insurance business. The stock added 8.9 per cent to $8.85.Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 5.5 per cent to $280.94 after the fast-food restaurant chain warned that fourth-quarter profits would miss estimates because of higher food costs.Fresh economic data released on Wednesday showed that consumer prices increased slightly in December while industrial production rose for the second month in a row, signalling a recovery after an uneven year.
236;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-01-16T22:21:12Z;Bank of New York MellonNY Mellon profits boosted by fee income;;Bank of New York Mellon reported a 23 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profits, bolstered by gains from investment management fees that helped offset pressure from low interest rates in the US and Europe.But shares in the world’s largest custodian bank closed 2.8 per cent lower in New York on Wednesday as analysts said the mixed results for the final three months of last year suggested there was only modest room for further profit expansion.The bank’s results were aided by a 17 per cent gain in revenues from its investment management unit which climbed to $853m, lifted by rising equity markets, higher fees and gains from an acquisition. Quarterly revenue rose 2 per cent to $3.6bn in the period despite weakness in other businesses.Net income rose to $622m, up from $505m a year ago. Earnings of 53 cents a share were in line with analysts’ forecasts and improved from 42 cents in the previous period. The gain included a 3 cent credit because of an adjustment in the way the bank calculates losses from its legacy mortgage portfolio.“We’re grinding out a modest amount of revenue growth in a tough environment,” said Todd Gibbons, the bank’s chief financial officer.“The good news is that if we see any normalisation around rates, trading activity and volumes, we’re well positioned for a pick-up,” he said, adding that the bank was not expecting market conditions to improve in 2013.Custodian banks such as Bank of New York Mellon safeguard investors’ assets and provide basic services including clearing payments and settling transactions.Performance for companies in the sector has been hindered by record low borrowing rates in the US and Europe. Revenues from net interest fell 7 per cent to $725m. The company’s net interest margin slipped from 1.2 per cent in the third quarter to 1.09 per cent.BNY Mellon blamed the declines on the elimination of interest on European Central Bank deposits and lower yields on the reinvestment of securities.Revenue from trading currencies also fell 42 per cent to $106m as lower volatility and falling volumes took their toll.BNY Mellon finished last year with $26.7tn of assets under custody, a 9 per cent increase from 2011.In the fourth quarter, the bank became caught in a continuing legal spat between Argentina and its creditors, stemming from the country’s 2001 default. As trustee for Argentina’s restructured debt, BNY Mellon is charged with dispensing payments from the country to investors in the exchanged bonds.Also on Wednesday, shares in Northern Trust Corp, another large custody bank, fell 5.7 per cent as it said net income rose 29 per cent to $167.7m. However, earnings of 69 cents a share for the fourth quarter fell 6 cents shy of analysts’ forecasts. Both foreign exchange trading income and net interest income declined in the fourth quarter, the company said.
237;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-01-13T04:43:38Z;Hedge fund buys extra help;Bridgewater brings in Northern Trust to back up BNY Mellon;Hedge fund company Bridgewater Associates has divided opinion with a “transformative” new approach to asset servicing, bringing in Northern Trust to duplicate and back up the work of its existing administrator BNY Mellon.The arrangement, which goes live in 2014 and has been hailed as unprecedented in the asset management industry, is a result of an “extensive two-year due diligence process to identify a firm with the financial stability, expertise, global scale, and technological infrastructure to support Bridgewater”, Northern Trust said in a statement.“In a role that will create approximately 100 jobs in Chicago and Stamford, Northern Trust will provide broad middle-office and back-office services including replicating various administrative processing, trade processing, valuation, real-time reporting, cash management, accounting and collateral management services,” the Chicago-based company said.The plan leaves Bridgewater, which has $130bn under management, with a back-up plan in case one of its administrators should make a critical error or fail. The deal will also force the administrators to compete on comparable – and, to Bridgewater, highly visible – metrics.Experts point out that hiring two service providers to perform the same task is not necessitated by regulation and is likely to be unusually costly for Bridgewater and/or its clients.“It sounds super-expensive. There’s got to be something else in it for them, and I’m racking my brains trying to think what it is,” said Lyn Marcrum, senior analyst at Aite Group.Bridgewater is tight-lipped about the deal, declining to comment beyond the information provided in a press release.Whatever the outcome for Bridgewater and its clients, the deal appears to be a coup for Northern Trust. The asset servicer acquired hedge fund administrator Omnium in July 2011 and transformed it into its hedge fund services department specifically to be able to bring in more alternatives investment business.This article also appears in Fundfire, a Financial Times service
238;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;BNY Mellon wins Europe depository backing;;BNY Mellon has received approval in Europe to launch a central securities depository (CSD) as the regulatory push to safeguard all aspects of the trading cycle reaches into securities settlement.The US custodian bank won regulatory approval in Belgium for the new service, called BNY Mellon CSD. The country will serve as the site of its operations and be regulated by the National Bank of Belgium. It will be headed by Chris Prior-Willeard, a longtime employee at BNY Mellon.The move deepens BNY Mellon’s push into Europe following the launch of clearing operations for customers out of Ireland 18 months ago.Both ventures illustrate how sweeping legislation overhauling banks and markets is reaching into the plumbing of the market.CSDs oversee the settlement of securities, the final part of the trade cycle where the transaction is confirmed as final and the security swapped for cash. While regulators have aimed little legislation directly at the industry, the cumulative effect of the US Dodd-Frank act, Basel III and the G20 requirements for mandatory central clearing of derivatives contracts, has left the financial services industry fearful of a shortage of collateral.Estimates vary but additional collateral could top $1tn-$2tn globally and CSDs are often repositories of high-quality collateral. Most CSDs are also primarily domestic institutions that work to process securities trades within national boundaries. However that potentially puts them into competition with large global custodian banks that already make money from clients with notary, settlement and asset security services.The banks often act as single access points for customers to a national CSD, exploiting their economies of scale to bring down cost or speed up settlement times for customers with multiple accounts at the same bank.“Setting up a CSD was the obvious answer for us, in response to all the coming regulatory changes,” said Nadine Chakar, executive vice-president, global collateral services at BNY Mellon.The move further extends BNY Mellon’s push into Europe after it launched Irish-based clearing operations in 2011.The business is an adjunct to BNY Mellon’s US business, where it serves as an intermediary between the customer and a clearing house. Investors can trade derivatives and have them cleared without becoming a member of a clearing house.
239;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2013-01-02T22:25:24Z;US banks retain key tax break in cliff deal;;US banks and other large cross-border companies will retain a key tax break covering billions of dollars in foreign income under this week’s fiscal cliff deal.Extending the so-called “subpart F exception for active financing income” will allow multinationals to defer paying US taxes on certain financial transactions undertaken outside the US. The companies are taxed by the US on that income only when it is brought back to the country.Proponents say the exemption evens out the playing field for those companies operating outside of the US – allowing them to compete with foreign rivals that may be charged a lower tax rate by their home governments. But critics say the exemption is one of many offshore tax loopholes that collectively cost the US $150bn a year, according to some estimates.The exemption was enacted as a temporary measure in 1998, as part of former US President Bill Clinton’s 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, but it has been extended by Congress every few years since.Companies including Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, General Electric and JPMorgan Chase have banded together to form the Active Financing Working Group, to lobby for renewing the exemption in recent years.The group has paid $1.03m to lobbying firm Elmendorf Ryan since 2009 to campaign for the tax break to be extended, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Extending the exemption will cost the US Treasury some $9.4bn in lost revenue in 2013, according to estimates from the Senate Joint Tax Committee.Subpart F of the US tax code requires companies to pay US tax on “passive” income earned from interest, dividends and other financial earnings overseas. The exception allows those companies to treat the income as “active” – meaning that US taxes are not imposed on the earnings until they are repatriated to the US.“The active financing rules, which have broad bipartisan support, are necessary to maintain the competitiveness of the US-based financial services industry and of manufacturing companies that rely on financial services arms to provide financing for large-ticket manufactured products,” the Active Financing Working Group said last year. Letting companies pay local taxes instead of the US rate can allow them to lend money or underwrite debt at more competitive rates, the group says.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an industry group which counts hundreds of banks and brokerages among its members, has also commented in favour of extending the tax break as part of the working group.
240;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-29T17:52:52Z;Argentina appeals against US bond ruling;;Argentina has urged a New York appeals court to reverse an order requiring it to pay $1.33bn to so-called “holdout” creditors, warning of a “Hobbesian ‘war against all’” if it did not.In a brief submitted late on Friday to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Argentina argued that it was barred by the US Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and its own legislation from paying $1.33bn into an escrow account for holders of debt on which it defaulted in 2001, led by Elliott, a fund, as ordered by New York Judge Thomas Griesa in November.His ruling, which the Second Circuit froze pending appeal, had set the stage for Argentina either to pay all creditors, including the Elliott-led “holdouts” who spurned two debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010, to whom it has long vowed not to pay a dollar, or no one, thus opening the door to a new default.Argentina, which swapped more than 92 per cent of its defaulted debt in 2005 and 2010, argued that as well as being “inequitable”, Judge Griesa’s orders “threaten to wreak havoc on countless innocent third parties …as well as to New York law and New York as a place to do business” and “severely endanger sovereign debt restructuring for all financially distressed states”.The Second Circuit court in October had upheld Judge Griesa’s ruling that Argentina had violated the a pari passu, or equal step, clause in the defaulted bonds, but had asked the judge to spell out how the payment formula he proposed would work and its impact on third parties. It has called a hearing for February 27 after all sides have aired their arguments in writing.Judge Griesa, Argentina said, “was wrong to ignore the chorus of voices” against his ruling. Indeed, the court received a flurry of submissions on Friday from other parties, including holders of the exchange bonds Argentina issued to restructure its defaulted debt, and the Bank of New York Mellon, the exchange bonds’ trustee, as well as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court brief, from the US.Judge Griesa had ordered BNY Mellon and other institutions in the payment chain not to help Argentina evade the ruling by shifting payment elsewhere. But Argentina said it could not be ordered by a US court to break its own “Lock Law” which effectively bolted the door to making new offers to defaulted creditors after the restructurings.Argentina said the only fair treatment for holdouts would be to pay them on the same terms as the bondholders who accepted the 2010 exchange. If the Second Circuit reversed the ruling, it said it could ask Congress to lift Argentina’s so-called Lock Law to allow a new debt swap.Eugenio Bruno, a lawyer advising some restructured bond holders, noted that in a footnote included in its amicus brief, the US appeared to cast some doubt on the potential wide-ranging implications for other restructurings that Argentina and the exchange bondholders see.The Second Circuit court in October upheld Judge Griesa’s earlier ruling that Argentina breached the pari passu clause not only by giving a higher payment rank to the restructured bonds but also because the lock law prevented it from paying the holdouts and thus breached the equal legal status of the bonds.But if the court had ruled that Argentina had violated the pari passu clause only as a result of the Lock Law, “it appears that such a ruling would not harm sovereign debt restructuring generally” the US brief said in its footnote. “That footnote should not be in there,” Mr Bruno said.This argument is likely to be exploited by the Elliott-led creditors, who argue that Argentina’s situation is unique and does not have system-wide ramifications.But Argentina argued that if the ruling stood, “we may very well see the end of such restructurings and enter an era where debt crises are unresolvable. This will increase litigation, not reduce it”.Elliott, meanwhile, said Argentina had ample means to pay up.“With more than $43 billion in foreign currency reserves and tens of billions of dollars in additional resources, Argentina has the overwhelming capacity to pay the $1.3 billion it owes in this matter,” a spokesman said. “[The December 28] filing by the Republic once again demonstrates Argentina’s irrational persistence in evading its contractual obligations and the orders of US courts.”Argentina joined a group of exchange bondholders led by Gramercy and including Brevan Howard, in asking the Second Circuit court to defer the definition of pari passu to the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.BNY Mellon said the ruling would “punish [its] lawful conduct” and at the very least, the Second Circuit court should spell out that it will not face any liability if it did not meet its obligations to distribute payment made by Argentina to the exchange bondholders.
241;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-28T16:09:26Z;Bondholders add twist to Argentina debt spat;;"A group of funds caught in the middle of Argentina’s latest debt saga has asked New York state’s highest court to define the meaning of a pivotal clause in a high-profile legal dispute that has sparked fears of a fresh sovereign default.The request to spell out the meaning of the pari passu – or equal step – clause, was submitted late on Thursday to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, a federal court, by so-called “exchange bondholders” (EBG), a group of holders of debt issued in 2005 and 2010 when Argentina restructured its defaulted bonds. The group includes Gramercy and hedge fund Brevan Howard.The submission came on the eve of a Friday deadline for Buenos Aires to submit its arguments to the Second Circuit court in New York. EBG will also file its brief.Argentina and funds led by Elliott Associates – which bought the country’s debt after the crash – are embroiled in a legal tug-of-war that has not only raised worries of another default, but also concerns that New York’s hallowed place at the heart of the world financial system could be at risk and questions whether sovereign restructurings could prove harder to pull off in future.The New York Court of Appeals has the final say on questions of New York law.The Second Circuit court sent shockwaves through markets in October when it upheld an earlier ruling by Judge Thomas Griesa that the pari passuclause in the nearly $100bn of bonds on which Argentina defaulted in 2001 meant that defaulted creditors who rejected the restructurings had the right to be repaid when Argentina paid the EBG.That left Argentina staring at the prospect of paying everyone, including the funds such as Elliott that it blasts as “vultures”, or no one, and tumbling into technical default despite being willing and able to continue servicing its restructured debt.On November 21, Judge Griesa ordered Argentina to pay $1.33bn into escrow for the so-called “holdouts”, led by Elliott, though the Second Circuit court froze that order pending its review of the judge’s clarification of two key issues: how the payment mechanism would work, and its impact on third parties.Judge Griesa had given his order teeth by requiring parties handling payments to the EBG, including Bank of New York Mellon, not to help Argentina circumvent the ruling by diverting payments. The Second Circuit court has scheduled a hearing on February 27 after all sides have had a chance to air their arguments in writing.“At the heart of the instant appeal is the issue of how to interpret under New York contract law a pari passu clause in an unsecured debt instrument – in this case, an international bond indenture issued by a sovereign debtor,” the EBG said in its filing.“Now that the district court has decided how payments should be made pursuant to the pari passu clause – an interpretation that has enormous consequences for New York’s pre-eminent financial services industry – the state’s highest court should be given an opportunity to ensure that this court’s review of the injunction is undertaken ‘with a correct understanding of the controlling principles of New York law’,” it added, citing a Second Circuit ruling from this year.Elliott slammed the latest move. “This is just one more brazen, yet frivolous, stunt pulled by exchange bondholders who, in an attempt to curry favour with the Argentine government, are taking extraordinary steps to assist Argentina in evading its contractual obligations to holders of defaulted Argentine debt,” a spokesman said.Elliott and other holdouts reject fears that future sovereign restructurings could be affected. But the US Treasury and State Departments said earlier this month that as things stood, the ruling “may adversely affect future voluntary sovereign debt restructurings, the stability of international financial markets and the repayment of loans extended by international financial institutions” and could be problematic under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.Thomas Laryea, a partner at SNR Denton, the law firm, and a former assistant general counsel at the International Monetary Fund, called the latest move made by the EBG “an interesting strategic twist. My sense …was that Argentina’s lawyers have been at pains to keep some federal law [eg, foreign sovereign immunity issues] in play,” he said.The Second Circuit court is not obliged to refer the pari passu question; nor is the New York Court of Appeals obliged to accept it, though if it does the case would return to the Second Circuit for other issues to be decided once the pari passu interpretation had been decided, lawyers say.“In theory the meaning of a contractual clause is a matter of state law and hence in theory the procedure is available in this case. But in practice I’d be pretty surprised – actually, astonished – if the federal court made the reference. Seems more like a delaying tactic to prolong the litigation,” said Matthew Parish, a partner at Holman Fenwick Willan, a law firm.Argentina, which has floated, in vague terms, the notion of offering a third swap of defaulted for new debt as a fairer solution, is expected to stress that Judge Griesa’s ruling prevents the EBG’s trustee, BNY Mellon, from delivering cash that belongs to the bondholders.The government of Cristina Fernández, who has often vowed never to pay “vultures” who bought defaulted bonds at a discount, won a breather when Judge Griesa’s order was frozen.“They got the impression they could win this,” said Eugenio Bruno, a former holdout lawyer."
242;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Argentina bondholders: can you spell (out) ‘pari passu’, please?;;"So after a lull, the arguments kick off again on Friday in Argentina’s legal fight not to pay so-called “holdout” creditors, and their fight to force the country, finally, to cough up.Argentina has until midnight New York time on Friday to file its brief to the New York Second Circuit Court of Appeals – and it will be hoping that the interested parties and “friends of the court” who have emerged in recent weeks – including holders of restructured bonds issued under non-New York jurisdictions, the US government, which could file an amicus brief on Friday too, and a local brokerage, Puente – will convince the judges that Judge Griesa’s order has got to go.Recapping the case quickly: Defaulted creditors (aka “holdouts” led by Elliott Associates, who spurned the country’s restructuring exchange after its 2001 default and “held out” for payment), won a legal victory in October when the Second Circuit appeals court ruled that Argentina cannot discriminate between the holders of defaulted and performing debt. The court upheld much of an earlier ruling by New York Judge Thomas Griesa but sought clarification from the judge on two key points – how the payment mechanism would work and the impact on third parties.Judge Griesa had ordered the government to pay holdouts when it made payments to holders of its restructured bondholders and in November said Argentina needed to pay $1.33bn into escrow for the holdouts.But with markets in a lather over the prospect of Argentina defaulting rather than paying the holdouts, the Second Circuit court put that order on ice pending its review of the ruling. That has granted Argentina a breather at least until a hearing scheduled for February 27.Why is this important? Well Argentina, the exchange bondholders and others make three main arguments:
1) the judge’s ruling is unfair because the holdouts bought bonds cheap after the default and want to collect in full;
2) the order would prevent the restructured bondholders’ trustee (the Bank of New York Mellon) from doing its fiduciary duty and delivering money which, once it is deposited in the BNY Mellon account in Buenos Aires, belongs to the bondholders; and
3) this is a bad precedent for future sovereign restructurings and New York’s important status in the financial and bond world.Federico Tomasevich, president of Puente, says “there’s no room for a negative ruling against Argentina”.Indeed Argentina seems to be hoping that the Second Circuit court will be scrutinising the judge’s definition of pari passu, or equal footing (ie the status of the defaulted debt vis-à-vis the restructured debt) – the nub of the issue in this case. The Second Circuit, however, did not object to Judge Griesa’s interpretation in October.So is it wishful thinking for Argentina to hope that it may do so now? Time will tell. Firmly in the other camp, meanwhile, is Professor John Baker, a visiting fellow at Oriel College, Oxford. He told a teleconference organised by holdout lobby group the American Task Force Argentina:The Second Circuit should be applauded for determining that Argentina must be bound by its contractual commitment to treat creditors equally, and Argentina’s claims that holdouts do not deserve to be paid are a clear strategy meant to continue avoiding the payment of billions of dollars it owes bondholders. Under Argentina’s logic, debt contracts would be irrelevant.The latest wrinkle in all this is that the exchange bondholders, who say they are being held hostage in all this, now want to involve a third court – the New York Court of Appeals (CoA). Without a definition from that court on what pari passu really means in this context, how can the Second Circuit hope to rule, is the gist of the argument. It is not yet clear when the Second Circuit will rule on whether it grants the request to involve the CoA.There are plenty of questions still outstanding: Could Argentina offer to pay in full but up to 2038, when the restructured bonds are due? Not likely, Gabriel Rubenstein (@GabyRubenstein) said in a Twitter forum on the issue on Thursday. Can Argentina wheel out a new killer argument on Friday? Probably not, according to Eugenio Bruno, (@eugeniobrunolaw) a former holdouts lawyer – the arguments will be similar but there is still doubt about whether Argentina will offer to reopen the debt restructuring swap.Emboldened by the release of its flagship navy training ship, the Libertad, which was impounded for more than two months in Ghana at the behest of Elliott, Argentina may think it is on a roll and there is certainly the feeling in Argentina that the heat is off.But it would be premature to hazard a guess yet as to how this one will go.Related reading:

243;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-27T16:49:34Z;EMs: the passive choice?;;"When it comes to passive or active investing – ie selective stock picks vs index tracking – there’s a big difference between companies based in emerging markets, and their counterparts in developed markets.You might think that investors in emerging market companies would be in the “pick-and-choose” camp – index tracking is more common in developed markets, surely, and the companies are better known? Actually, it’s the other way round.According to a recent bank investor relations survey, shareholders in emerging market companies are much more likely to be passive investors than shareholders in developed market-based comapnies. In BNY Mellon’s eighth Global Trends in Investor Relations Survey, the passive investors were a full 24 percentage points higher – 62 per cent in EM-based companies, to 38 per cent in DM-based.Here’s the chart:BNY Mellon said in the survey that:The increase in the share of passive investors in emerging markets may be allied to the global shift to index investing, in particular investors gaining exposure to emerging markets via indices.The definition of active and passive that BNY Mellon used was:(Investors that buy and hold stocks for many years were considered active – the action of holding is still a choice.)BNY Mellon added that “in a world of increasingly passive investment, which seems to be the case for companies in emerging markets, the fight for capital is even more intense; with fewer managers there are few active managers making qualitative decisions based on their assessment of a company’s prospects, the value they place on disclosures and guidance”.As Emma Boyde reported for FTfm earlier in December, there are some inherent risks in passive investing. Jan Dehn, co-head of research at Ashmore group said: “I think passive investing is a curse sent to us by the devil. I think it’s extremely dangerous.” Other analysts suggested that the risks of emerging markets were not necessarily priced in, and pointed to environmental, social and governance factors in EMs.The BNY Mellon survey had 817 online respondents from 59 countries – making it a significant sample.Related reading:

244;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;FSA seeks to fine and ban AFP chief;;The City watchdog is seeking to fine the chief executive of Arch Financial Products £650,000 and ban him from working at a regulated company for “reckless” failures to manage and disclose conflicts of interest in the group’s management of the suspended Arch Cru funds.The Financial Services Authority said in its decision notice that AFP caused the funds to invest indirectly in four separate transactions where there was a risk the company would benefit at the expense of the funds. In one case, the watchdog said Robin Farrell, the chief executive, made a capital gain of £492,359 on selling shares to a Guernsey entity that was in turn owned by the Arch Cru funds.The watchdog is also seeking to ban Robert Addison, AFP’s chief operating officer, and fine him £200,000. It said it would have also fined AFP £9m, but opted not to because of the company’s financial woes.Mr Farrell, Mr Addison and AFP are fighting the allegations and plan to take their case to the tribunal that hears appeals from FSA decisions.At their peak in September 2008, the Arch Cru funds had £645m under management, but thousands of private investors lost money and they were suspended in 2009. At the time of suspension, the net asset value of the funds was £362m.The FSA also alleges that AFP failed to keep on hand sufficient liquidity, noting that at a critical time, the funds were heavily invested in Guernsey-listed cells for which there was a limited secondary market. The FSA said the funds held just 6 per cent of assets in cash in 2009.AFP and its executives said in a statement: “The criticisms in the notices are wrong . . . We believe that the FSA still fundamentally does not understand the structure in place but has approached the investigation with a predetermined view as to alleged fault.”They said the FSA should be partly to blame for investor losses because its intervention in 2009 had the effect of “forcing Arch to relinquish management of the funds at a critical time. We believe that those actions significantly contributed to investors’ losses”.The Financial Ombudsman Service said that it had settled more than 150 complaints from Arch Cru investors since the funds were suspended, most were directed against the adviser who recommended the investment. Compensation paid out via the Ombudsman is capped at £150,000.
245;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
246;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-17T20:51:45Z;Up to 100 Arch Cru fund sellers to fold;;Up to 100 financial advice firms that sold high-risk, illiquid Arch Cru funds to retail investors are expected to fail next year as a result of being made to pay compensation, according to the Financial Services Authority.However, the regulator has claimed that the number of failures would have doubled if it had not amended its original compensation proposals.By making investors “opt in” to its proposed £140m redress scheme – instead of forcing advisers to make automatic payments – the FSA expects the total payout to be between £20m and £40m.From April 1, all advisers who recommended investments in CF Arch Cru investment and diversified funds will have one month to write to clients asking whether they would like their case reviewed. Less than a third of investors are expected to agree.This is the first time that the regulator has used new redress powers to force an industry-wide review of past business.One in six of the advice firms that sold Arch Cru funds are at risk of failing, the regulator estimates. As a result, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees retail investments if an insolvent company cannot pay, is expected to be left with a bill of up to £7m. Under the original plan, the cost to the FSCS would have been closer to £33m.The regulator said that it had changed the compensation process in recognition of the problems that payments would cause the advice industry.However, it said that it could see no reason why the scheme was inappropriate.“Advisers have to accept and understand that ultimately they are responsible for making sure their customers’ interests are protected,” said Clive Adamson, FSA director of supervision.“If they do not understand a product or have not done the due diligence on it, they are in no position to recommend it to their customers.”Thousands of private investors lost money when Arch Cru funds were suspended in 2009 due to insufficient liquidity. At the time of suspension, the net asset value of the funds was £362m.Many savers who put money into Arch Cru funds believed they were buying into a low-risk, “cautious” products. But the funds, which were invested in vehicles listed on the Channel Islands stock exchange, held a number of non-mainstream assets such as student housing and fine wine.In late 2011, a separate £54m redress scheme for investors was agreed by Capita, the authorised corporate director of the funds, and HSBC and BNY Mellon, which acted as depositaries. But, following pressure from consumer groups and MPs, the FSA consulted on a further redress scheme – paid for by the firms that advised investors to buy into Arch Cru funds.Clients eligible for redress should be put back in the position they would have been if they had received suitable advice, the FSA said.
247;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-16T03:19:28Z;Uncertain future for custodians;As profits fall analysts see a faulty business model;"The way custodian banks operate requires a complete overhaul, as falling revenues and dismal market conditions wreck the business models of State Street, Bank of New York Mellon and other big players, industry analysts argue.Consultants monitoring the behaviour of custodian banks claim that slashing costs is not enough to revive the industry’s growth. And moves by banks to ditch unprofitable clients smack of desperation, they claim.“Custodians have a big problem,” said one industry watcher. “They entered the bear market with a business model built for the bull market.”Put simply, the difficulty is that three of custodian banks’ main businesses – foreign exchange, cash management and securities lending – are not the profit centres they were.To make matters more toxic, the squeezing of margins also coincides with the lodging of lawsuits and a regulatory investigation.Here in the UK, regulators with the Financial Services Authority are investigating allegations that State Street overcharged Ireland’s state pension fund and big UK corporate pension funds, including those of the Royal Mail and J Sainsbury, by billing them for fees not included in their contracts.In the US, meanwhile, State Street is being sued by California, which alleges the bank improperly charged its state pension funds for foreign exchange services. And just last month, BNY Mellon settled a lawsuit filed by the state of Virginia’s pension fund over the same issue.The lawsuits have triggered a wave of negative headlines. At the same time, custodian banks face a business situation so dire that some now “close the door” on unpromising clients in a bid to protect their bottom lines.“Banks are actually saying we don’t think you’re a profitable client for us. We want you to pay us more, or we will terminate our contract,” said Ben Gunnee, a principal at Mercer Investment Consulting.“It’s a very difficult market. Custodial banks are not growing their asset bases, and their returns from their cash management businesses, their securities lending business and foreign exchange are diminishing.”A quick look at their recent balance sheets showcases their problems. Custodial banks boast more cash on deposit these days, but low interest rates hurt net interest margins, so they are making less money. In the first quarter of 2008, for example, BNY Mellon’s net interest margin was 2.14 per cent while State Street’s was 2.20 per cent, according to statistics from Global Custodian, the industry publication. By last quarter, those margins had fallen to 1.25 per cent for BNY Mellon and 1.53 per cent for State Street.Poor volatility in the currency markets and shrinking fees hurt custodians’ earnings from foreign exchange, meanwhile.Revenue from lending securities is also dropping as broker-dealers and their hedge-fund clients are putting on fewer short positions; higher capital and liquidity ratios are also reducing the supply of stocks and increasing the cost of leverage.Hani Kablawi, BNY Mellon’s head of asset servicing for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said that BNY Mellon and its rivals were changing their pricing, outsourcing, cutting costs further and consolidating businesses to stave off the effects of the downturn. State Street could not be reached for comment.Before the financial crisis kicked off, in the fourth quarter of 2007, State Street reported $256m in revenues from its securities lending business while BNY Mellon saw $164m in the same period. By the third quarter of this year, State Street’s revenue take from that group had dropped to $91m while BNY Mellon’s fell to $37m, according to Global Custodian.The negative headlines sparked by the lawsuits have given pension funds the upper hand when negotiating fees with custodian banks in some cases.This shift in power comes in handy for investors. It remains difficult, for institutional investors to “vote with their feet” and defect to another custodian bank as the market is small and the task cumbersome. Calpers, the Californian pension fund, for example, kept State Street on as its custodian back in 2010 despite lodging a lawsuit against it over its fees on foreign-exchange trades a few months earlier. The Virginia state pension fund, meanwhile, also opted to keep BNY Mellon on as its custodian bank following its round of litigation.“Whether you like a custody bank or not, you have no choice but to use one,” noted James Economides, director with Amaces, a consulting service specialising in custodial management. “And there are only a handful of them. So, we tend to advise our clients to negotiate rather than leave one behind.”State Street also faces pressure from investors who have grown frustrated with its stagnant stock price and its poor attempts to cut costs. Earlier this year, four out of 10 of the bank’s largest shareholders told the Financial Times that they were seeking to oust either chief executive Joseph Hooley or chief financial officer Edward Resch who later resigned. And activist investor Nelson Peltz’s company Trian, which holds a 2 per cent stake in State Street, is still calling for more cost savings from the company and reduced executive pay packages.Industry analysts forecast that the big custodian banks willl see sluggish growth for the next two to three years despite a new push to slash costs. “The investment story has not advanced much in the last quarter, the operating environment remains challenging, and we continue to expect sluggish growth over the next two to three years,” Brad Hintz, a BernsteinResearch banking analyst, concludes in a recent note.The imminent arrival of Solvency II and Basel III regulations also rachets up pressure on custodian banks’ margins as costly new reporting and capital requirements will be introduced, industry analysts agreed."
248;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-16T03:18:30Z;Newton ‘sale’ surprises market;Banks are keen to sell off non-core assets;Banks, under pressure from capital ratio requirements, are keen to sell off non-core assets such as their wealth management arms, according to David Scott, a former UBS banker turned independent wealth manager.Newton Investment Management, owned by US bank and financial services group BNY Mellon, was last week reported to be putting its wealth management arm on the block and – if it comes to fruition – is a case in point, industry observers said.“Banks feel they can get a good price on their wealth management operations so want to take the capital they can get from a sale,” said Mr Scott, chief executive of Vestra Wealth.Newton, which declined to comment on the reports, has a total of £49bn assets under management, which includes £3.5bn generated by its private client business.Michael Maslinkski, a director of wealth management consultant Maslinski & Co, said the sale rumours, in part, came as a surprise.“It has good results, delivers good service and has been well-managed by BNY Mellon. But while it is an important part of its UK business, it is just small fry in the bank’s global picture and non core”, he said.In August, Bank of America Merrill Lynch sold its loss-making non-US wealth management business to Julius Baer, the Swiss private bank.In contrast UBS, the Swiss Bank, is focusing on its highly prized wealth management unit, which it regards as core to the business, while paring back on its investment banking activities.Investor trust in wealth management arms of big banks remains an issue for many rich individuals who got their fingers burned in the financial crisis and headed for more personalised boutique wealth managers. “The idea of big global banks as trusted advisers is nonsense. For most investors wealth management is a personal business,” said Mr Maslinski.
249;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-09T19:05:47Z;Banks plan to move 3,000 jobs out of City;;Three global investment banks plan to move 3,000 City of London jobs to other UK cities and towns over the next few years, bringing respite to regional financial centres as they struggle against heavy job losses in banking and insurance.The moves by Bank of America, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank will bring hope that the much talked-of “nearshoring” – a movement of jobs either out of expensive London or from overseas back to Britain – may finally start to gather pace.If so, it could not come too soon for other cities. Eight of the UK’s 10 largest financial centres have lost thousands of financial and professional services jobs over the past three years, according to data compiled for the Financial Times.Glasgow has lost 14 per cent of its jobs in these sectors, Leeds has lost 11 per cent, Bristol 10 per cent and Edinburgh 9 per cent. Only Manchester and Cardiff have maintained their employment levels.The figures were calculated by TheCityUK, the finance sector industry body, from official statistics. They show that while the big centres have shrunk, smaller areas have grown. These include Tatton – incorporating Knutsford and Alderley Edge in Cheshire – Milton Keynes, Exeter and Coventry.London has lost only 1.4 per cent of its jobs since 2008 – a surprisingly low figure in view of the City’s travails since the financial crisis began. However, these figures include lawyers, accountants and management consultants as well as bankers and traders.Overall, the UK lost 106,000, or 4.9 per cent, of its financial and professional services jobs between 2008 and 2011. That is deeper than the 3 per cent fall in employment across the economy over that period.Regional centres are hoping for an increase in nearshoring to offset these losses. So far, it has been slow to accelerate, but the squeeze on financial companies’ profits is forcing them to look hard at costs. Moving jobs to the regions can save 40 per cent on the wage bill.Bank of America expects to move up to 2,000 back- and middle-office staff to Chester over the next decade, according to people close to the plans. The US bank is transferring a few posts in operations, human resources and finance to the northwest city, where it already employs 3,000.JPMorgan, which employs 14,000 in the UK, is expected to move about 1,000 roles from London’s Canary Wharf to Bournemouth over the next three years, with a similar number of lower-grade positions moved to Asia. It already employs 4,000 in the south coast town.Deutsche Bank could be among the first to move client-facing “front office” roles to a city outside London. It plans to bring sales traders to Birmingham, its main UK nearshoring hub, where it employs 1,300 wealth management, back- and middle-office staff.Deutsche will hire about 25 fixed-income sales traders in Birmingham for institutional clients, adding to a few corporate client-facing staff it transferred last year. It is also considering setting up an equity sales team there.The sales traders will mainly deal with medium-sized clients, allowing Deutsche’s London team to concentrate on larger accounts.Bankers say that with fixed income trading moving on to electronic platforms, and client communication increasingly done over the phone or via messaging systems, a sales worker’s location has become less relevant.“There is a track record of companies arriving in London and then nearshoring into other parts of the UK,” said Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK. “These nearshore centres are globally competitive – they are now taking jobs from Mexico and India in their own right.”He acknowledged, however, that the UK faced a tough fight, particularly against Asian centres. Out of 147 location decisions taken over the past six years by companies considering whether to invest in the UK or elsewhere, more than half went against Britain. TheCityUK reckons nearly a fifth of jobs lost since 2007 went overseas.Mr Cummings is pressing the coalition for measures to improve Britain’s competitive position, including certainty on tax, regulation that does not stifle growth, better immigration policies and a decision on airport expansion.Recent examples of nearshoring include Royal Bank of Scotland, which has moved almost 300 jobs from the City to Manchester. It plans to add another 100 there over the next 12 to 18 months.The Bank of New York Mellon established a global transaction settlement centre in Manchester in 2005, which now employs more than 1,000 in back-office roles. The bank describes Manchester as one of its “three global growth centres” along with Pune, in India, and Pittsburgh in the US.Owen Kelly, chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the industry body, said Scotland was winning jobs in areas such as asset servicing, with BlackRock and State Street expanding in Edinburgh. Barclays has created hundreds of jobs at a shared services hub in Glasgow.Reporting by Brian Groom, Patrick Jenkins, Daniel Schäfer, Andy Bounds, John Murray Brown and Chris Tighe
250;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-07T14:46:31Z;Letter from Lex – Christmas shopping;;Some companies have started their Christmas shopping early. Baxter spent $4bn buying Swedish dialysis-product maker Gambro, but it was the world’s second biggest copper producer that really splashed the cash. Freeport-McMoRan spent $20bn on two oil exploration & production companies as it diversified into a new industry. That was not the only big oil or mining story. Repsol filed a $10.5bn arbitration request at the World Bank over Argentina’s expropriation of YPF. In mining, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took a stake in Norilsk Nickel in an attempt to settle a long-running spat between two other Russian billionaires. In a separate dispute over commodities, Singapore threw its full weight behind trader Olam to fend off shortseller Muddy Waters.Others were also thinking about buying or selling. Cable & Wireless Communications could receive more than $1bn for its telecoms interests in eight islands from Bahrain’s Batelco while Singapore Airlines is looking to sell its 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic. US chipmaker Qualcomm decided to risk $120m by investing in struggling electronics maker Sharp while UK grocer Tesco made a long-overdue decision to withdraw from the US market. In the aerospace & defence sector three European nations raised their stakes in EADS while Rolls-Royce faced the possibility of prosecution over allegations of corruption and bribery in Indonesia and China.

251;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-05T15:50:29Z;More bondholders in Argentine legal spat;;Holders of restructured Argentine bonds denominated in euros and issued under UK law have waded into the legal battle over the fallout from a US court ruling on the country’s defaulted debt.Three US funds, Knighthead Capital Management, Redwood Capital Management and Perry Capital, which hold more than €1.2bn of Argentine euro bonds governed by the laws of England and Wales, asked the Second Circuit Court of Appeals late on Tuesday to be allowed to file arguments in the case, saying that their payments are also being put at risk.The appeals court, which is reviewing New York Judge Thomas Griesa’s tough interpretation of the “pari passu”, or equal treatment, clause in nearly $100bn of bonds on which Argentina defaulted in 2001, has already allowed holders of restructured US-law Argentine bonds to join the case.The US-law exchange bondholders argue that Judge Griesa’s November 21 order for Argentina to pay $1.3bn to so-called “holdouts” – which the Argentine government says are mostly “vulture funds” undeserving of full payment because they bought defaulted debt for pennies – makes a new default more likely because Argentina would not be able to pay exchange bondholders without also paying the so-called “holdouts” led by US fund Elliott Associates.The judge’s order, which has been frozen by the appeals court pending its ruling – a hearing has been set for February 2, 2013 – sought to make the payment enforceable by enjoining institutions in the payment chain not to help Argentina circumvent New York and pay the bonds elsewhere.BNY Mellon, the trustee of those restructured US-law bonds and the first link in the payment chain, has also asked the court for leave to file its own arguments.The euro bondholders, which represent about a tenth of Argentina’s outstanding euro-denominated restructured debt, are paid in Europe with payment to them starting in Argentina, it is then transferred to a bank in Germany and is distributed by European clearing houses.“At no point in the payment chain do funds enter the US or flow through US entities,” the euro bondholders said, adding the orders appeared “to seek to enjoin the conduct of third parties around the world, including Clearstream Banking SA, Euroclear Bank SANV and the Euroclear System, the foreign clearinghouses that clear payments in euro on the euro bonds, and the Bank of New York Mellon SANV, a subsidiary of the Bank of New York Mellon that upon information and belief is incorporated in Belgium”.They argued that they are “uniquely affected” because Judge Griesa’s ruling would prevent payment to euro bondholders from being disbursed unless the Elliott-led group were also paid in full.“The virtually limitless scope of the November 21 Orders, which go far beyond the lawful jurisdiction of the district court, gives rise to specific legal issues pertaining to the euro bonds and euro bondholders that are separate and apart from those that will be raised by other parties,” the funds said in their request to the court.The November 21 orders responded to the appeal court’s request for clarification on two points in a ruling issued on October 26. In that, however, the appeal court appeared not to consider that non-New York law bonds would be affected, saying that in the case of future restructurings “none of the bonds issued by Greece, Portugal or Spain . . . are governed by New York law”.“Until now, the market focused on the way the appeals court might draw a line between one financial intermediary and another in terms of who could be enjoined by court orders,” said Vladimir Werning at JPMorgan.“Now, euro bondholders are attempting to have the appeals court also draw a line between different assets: on one hand, the US-dollar New York law bonds and on the other, their euro UK-law bonds which they hope can be considered as lying beyond the US courts’ jurisdiction.”If what he called a “request for VIP treatment” by the euro bondholders is granted by the appeal court, he expected the spread between euro and US dollar-denominated restructured bonds to narrow – the euro discount bond is currently trading at a discount of around 150 basis points to the dollar discount.
252;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;US court rejects Argentina default payment;;A US appeals court has rejected a request from defaulted creditors led by Elliott Associates, a US fund, to require Argentina to post security of at least $250m by Monday to demonstrate its willingness to pay any judgment in their favour.The ruling from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals means there will be no change to a schedule it laid down last week for the thorny case, which has pit the government against funds it decries as “vultures” and sparked fears of a new Argentine default.The case has important ramifications for the international financial system and future sovereign restructurings.Argentina is appealing against a November 21 ruling by New York Judge Thomas Griesa, ordering it to pay $1.3bn to the defaulted creditors under the pari passu, or equal step, clause in the bonds which Argentina has not paid since crashing to the world’s biggest sovereign default on almost $100bn in 2001. The appeals court has scheduled a hearing for February 27.Other parties have been caught up in the crossfire of the dispute – including the holders of bonds issued in debt restructuring exchanges in 2005 and 2010 who feared they would not be paid.Judge Griesa’s order prevented banks and clearing houses from aiding Argentina in rerouting payments to them to evade his order to pay the holdouts, meaning Argentina would have to pay the funds it has long said do not deserve payment if it wanted to avoid default.Led by Gramercy, a fund, the exchange bondholders have been accepted by the appeals court as interested parties and the Bank of New York Mellon, their indenture trustee and the first step in the bondholders’ payment chain, has also applied to the court to be able to submit its own arguments.That underscores the high stakes in the case, since BNY Mellon is the world’s biggest custody bank.The exchange bondholders had asked the appeals court to order Argentina to post a security of $2bn to protect them if it upheld Elliott’s request to make a deposit. Since the court turned down Elliott, the exchange creditor’s request is no longer an issue. The next key date in this saga is now December 28, when Argentina must submit its appeal to the court.The Second Circuit court had upheld most of Judge Griesa’s initial ruling on the case, in February, but in October sent it back to him for clarification of how the pari passu payment would work in practice, and its impact on third parties.Argentina is betting that the mounting concern among such third parties will bolster its case for a rejection of Judge Griesa’s interpretation of pari passu and has floated the idea of reopening the debt exchange to holdouts as a fairer solution to the intractable problem.But holdouts – both large funds and individual investors – who have litigated for more than a decade will not take a swap voluntarily. Argentina owes holdouts as much as $11bn.

255;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-04T00:15:38Z;BNY Mellon joins Argentina spat;;Bank of New York Mellon has waded into the legal dispute between Argentina and its bondholders, underscoring the high stakes involved in the outcome of the sovereign debt restructuring case for the world’s biggest custody bank.BNY Mellon has been caught in the middle of the dispute ever since New York Judge Thomas Griesa ruled that Argentina could not pay the holders of the defaulted debt it restructured in 2005 and 2010 without also paying “holdouts” of the bonds.As trustee for Argentina’s restructured debt, BNY Mellon is charged with dispensing payments from the country to investors in the exchanged bonds.But on Monday the bank filed an appeal of Judge Griesa’s November 21 decision, asking the court to allow it to submit its own arguments and opinions. A US appeals court already put Mr Griesa’s order on hold last week at the request of Argentina, and a hearing is set for February 27 to discuss the issue.The bank has so far been sending non-party legal briefs asking the court to provide guidance that would ensure BNY Mellon is not held in violation of the judge’s order or its trustee indenture. But two people familiar with the bank’s thinking have told the Financial Times that BNY Mellon is willing to take the case to the US Supreme Court if February’s hearing goes against Argentina. However, the people also noted Argentina was likely to make the first move in any supreme court appeal.The dispute highlights the important intermediary role played by BNY Mellon, as well as New York’s position as a global payment processing centre and hub for sovereign debt sales. Earlier this month the New York Federal Reserve warned that Judge Griesa’s controversial order “could have operational ramifications that impede the smooth and efficient operation of the payments system”.Argentina’s options for re-routing payments around New York law, and possibly BNY Mellon, have become a popular game for analysts. They include everything from sending cheques to bondholders to offering them to swap into local-law bonds.“Our impression is that this boils down to a blueprint for an end game where Argentina snuffs NY law, its courts and its payment system,” Vladimir Werning, a JPMorgan analyst, wrote after Judge Griesa’s revised order to pay holdouts.Holdouts believe time granted by last week’s stay will be devoted to a rerouting strategy.BNY Mellon has said it has no knowledge of Argentina preparing such a move.The Argentine case has also led to soul-searching in another critical area of New York’s financial prominence: whether sovereigns will reject its governing law for issuing debt, versus London’s.Some observers point to English law as a better defence against holdouts, citing a 2005 analysis by a lawyers’ committee established by the Bank of England. It says courts should not construe pari passu – meaning “equal footing” – to mean “equal payment” in bond contracts, the interpretation which US courts have used against Argentina.Alternatively, a few legal tweaks could be all that is needed to keep New York on top as a home of sovereign debt sales.“If the pari passu clause interpretation is so crazy, one can just modify the clause,” said Mitu Gulati, a law professor at Duke University. A buyer of bonds could also “embrace the fact that there is one jurisdiction that is willing to try to protect its rights”, he added.
256;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-12-03T19:37:41Z;Argentina/BNYMellon – where credit’s due;So the two sides have a reprieve, but are both still in a bind;When Bank of New York Mellon made a payment to holders of Argentina’s bonds on Monday, the money flowed as usual. As the world’s largest custodial bank, BNY Mellon occupies a key role in the financial system. One of its jobs is to route payments between bond debtors and creditors. This is done automatically, like any electronic transfer. In the case of Argentina, BNY Mellon holds funds received from Argentina in trust so they can be paid to bondholders.This particular job has become a bit complicated, however. BNY Mellon is entangled in Argentina’s long-running war with creditors stemming from its 2001 default. A group of funds that refused to participate in previous restructurings, successfully argued before a New York court that Argentina must pay them if it pays the bondholders who accepted restructuring. The judge insisted that Argentina treat all of the bondholders the same, which meant that the holdouts were due $1.3bn by December 15. Furthermore, unless Argentina pays the holdouts, BNY Mellon is prohibited from paying the restructured bondholders – despite its fiduciary duty to do so as their trustee. Argentina received a reprieve from an appeals court to continue paying the restructured bondholders, and not the holdouts, until a new hearing in late February. It is a temporary respite. BNY Mellon argues that involving them exposes trustees in bond deals to added risk and cost and markets to added uncertainty.However this dispute is resolved, there is more at stake than the obligations of sovereign issuers and the rights of their bondholders. The payment system must also be protected. The responsibilities of its various participants must be spelt out. A dispute between an elusive debtor and its relentless creditors must not be allowed to clog the plumbing that ensures the functioning of markets worldwide.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
257;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-11-27T19:47:56Z;Markets: An unforgiven debt;A US ruling against Argentina could switch initiative in bond markets back to creditors;When Cipriano Castro, a fearsomely mustachioed strongman from the Andes, seized power in Venezuela in 1899 and defaulted on the government’s foreign debts, the jilted European powers knew how to react: they sent the warships, which bombarded and blockaded the country until a settlement was reached.The enforcement of creditor rights in sovereign debt restructurings has since become less violent. Gunboats gradually became an unacceptable way of collecting debts. For much of the past century, governments have largely been able to renege on their debts with a degree of impunity, albeit not without some pain.Yet a decision last week by a New York court could swing the pendulum back towards creditors. Although the case may still end up in the US Supreme Court, the ruling potentially erodes the ability of countries to spurn creditors – and could embolden those hedge funds, known as vultures, that specialise in suing recalcitrant governments.The case in question is a long-running legal battle between Argentina and several so-called vulture funds that refused to join the 93 per cent of creditors that agreed to the punitive restructuring that followed the country’s 2001 default. The US courts have ruled unexpectedly harshly against Argentina, rattling markets and throwing money managers, lawyers and analysts into a spasm of speculation.“This has the potential to break the paradigm of the sovereign debt world,” says Hans Humes of Greylock Capital Management, a fund that specialises in emerging markets. Mr Humes co-chaired the committee of Argentina’s bondholders and sat on Greece’s creditor committee during its restructuring this year.“Creditor rights have been methodically stripped away in recent years, but this may bring us back,” he says.Elliott Associates, the main hedge fund plaintiff, is run by Paul Singer, the US billionaire, and has made extracting money from defaulting governments its calling card. Elliott won the Argentine case through an arguably novel interpretation of a Latin phrase: pari passu. It means “on equal footing” or “in equal step” and is a venerable legal clause in bonds and loans.In corporate bankruptcies, pari passu creditors rank equally in the queue when companies are dissolved, the assets are sold and proceeds disbursed to lenders. Although countries do not go into bankruptcy, the clause has long featured in government bonds and loans even though lawyers disagree on the clause’s meaning and importance, says Mitu Gulati, a law professor at Duke University and former lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb, Argentina’s counsel.Argentina has struggled to manage its money throughout its two centuries as an independent nation – and was once so hard-up it tried to swap the Falkland Islands for its debt, writes Jude Webber.It received its first loan, from Britain, in 1824 but had defaulted by 1890. In 1949 it declared itself debt-free and was even a creditor to Italy, Finland, Belgium and Romania, which had been devastated by war. But by 2001 it had racked up the world’s biggest sovereign default by halting payment on nearly $100bn of foreign debt.Elliott and Aurelius Capital, its co-plaintiff, founded by a former Elliott trader, successfully argued that the pari passu clause in their defaulted bonds meant that Argentina could not continue to ignore them while paying the holders of its restructured debt.But District Court Judge Thomas Griesa went further than just finding in favour of the hedge funds. Lawyers say he broke new ground in how widely the clause can be interpreted, and how far creditors can go in seeking redress from defaulting countries.Lenders can win legal cases against countries, but winning compensation is trickier. Most overseas government assets are protected by sovereign immunity. Vultures typically try to create such legal bother that countries eventually pay them to go away.But this so-called holdout strategy depends on extreme patience and deep pockets. Argentina, for example, has largely been able to thumb its nose at creditors for almost a decade. Elliott has proved a dogged adversary and even seized an Argentine navy training ship in October after it docked in Ghana. But despite this forceful demonstration of willpower, Elliot has so far failed to extract a single peso from Buenos Aires.By contrast, Judge Griesa has backed up the bark of his ruling with a sharp bite that may bolster the hedge funds in their showdown with Argentina. The injunction prohibited third parties from “aiding and abetting” any violation of his order.This was primarily aimed at Bank of New York Mellon, the conduit of Argentina’s payments to the holders of its restructured debts. Unless the appeals court intervenes, Argentina must pay Elliott and the other plaintiffs more than $1.3bn by December 15, BNY Mellon will breach the injunction if it transfers regular payments to Argentina’s lenders due on the same date.BNY Mellon is unlikely to defy the court, so this essentially means that unless Argentina pays the vulture funds it could default on its international debts once more. Lawyers say that Judge Griesa’s legal dragnet leaves little room for escape, though Argentina and holders of restructured bonds have filed emergency appeals. It also applies to parties in the payments system – the economy’s circulatory system – including overseas clearing houses such as Euroclear.This has far-reaching implications, says Anna Gelpern, a law professor at American University and Georgetown, previously of the US Treasury and Cleary Gottlieb.“Grabbing a ship in Ghana is serious, but still a serious nuisance. In contrast, the ability of holdouts to seize money in the payments system is of systemic importance,” Ms Gelpern says. “Gunboats could target individual countries but targeting the payments system is an entirely different kettle of fish.”In a similar case in 2004, the New York Federal Reserve argued that the vulture funds’ methods represented “terrorism of payments and settlement systems”. Euroclear says it is monitoring the case “closely” but does “not intend to breach this US court order”.Argentina’s restructured bondholders have reacted with fury, and have hired David Boies, the celebrated litigator who represented Al Gore in the Supreme Court case that decided the 2000 presidential election. In an odd twist, Elliott’s lawyer is Ted Olson, the former US solicitor general who represented George W. Bush.In the motion to avert the injunction, the bondholders’ lawyers attacked Judge Griesa’s “level of rancour” against Argentina and argued that it could damage foreign relations.…Other powerful actors could also intervene. Whitney Debevoise, a partner at Arnold & Porter and the former US executive director of the World Bank, argues that the court’s interpretation of pari passu could lead to challenges of the protected status multinational organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund enjoy in debt restructurings.This “seniority” is a longstanding custom that has never been tested. Indeed, even Elliott stated that “commercial creditors never were nor could be on equal footing with the multinational organisations”.Thomas Laryea, a partner at SNR Denton, the law firm, and former assistant general counsel at the IMF, argues that the official sector’s protection is unharmed by the pari passu argument, and says “the court did a job of avoiding a hot potato”.Despite the uproar the court case has already caused, many experts caution that the impact could still prove to be limited outside legal academia. They point out several factors that limit its usefulness as a precedent.The wording of pari passu clauses vary from contract to contract. Argentina’s bonds implied a promise of equal payment, not just equal ranking. This was clearly violated by Argentina’s so-called lock law that in effect prohibits payments to holdouts. Although the courts did not base their rulings on the law, it made a breach much more obvious. Lawyers say other pari passu clause cases may be harder to argue.Argentina’s obstinacy also makes it an outlier in the history of sovereign restructurings. Most countries quickly – or eventually – pay off holdouts, and restructurings go relatively smoothly despite the presence of vultures, says Charles Blitzer, a former IMF official. Greece, for example, restructured its larger local debts but has chosen to pay international law bonds in full to avoid costly and destabilising suits.Argentina, on the other hand, boasts a debt museum in Buenos Aires that charts its chequered history of defaults and a board game called Eternal Debt in which players are asked: “Can you beat the IMF?”The US courts have also argued that the broad interpretation of pari passu will not thwart future sovereign restructurings, pointing out that since 2005 the vast majority of New York law bonds have included collective action clauses. These allow a certain majority of bondholders to force holdouts to sign up to an agreed settlement.Most of all, the Argentine saga has further to run. The appeals court still has to approve whether third parties and bondholders’ payments can be forcibly enlisted by Judge Griesa to put pressure on Argentina.Argentina has vowed to appeal all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. The highest court normally does not hear contract interpretation cases of this kind but could do so if it thinks the ruling could have a systemic impact on the payments system and the international bond market.Most sovereign law and restructuring experts agree that the case will inevitably have repercussions.Collective action clauses, for example, are no panacea because they largely apply only to individual bonds, not a country’s overall debt burden. Hedge funds can still play holdout by gaining a blocking minority in one bond, making a restructuring of that instrument impossible.…Anne Krueger, a former senior official at the IMF and chief economist at the World Bank, now a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, argues that the case “clearly represents an erosion of sovereign immunity” that will embolden vulture funds in the future.“Unless the Griesa ruling is overturned, this will open up a can of worms that will have to be dealt with,” she warns. “I don’t think it will be a revolution, as enough people have an interest in preserving the status quo. But it will have an impact.”This may not necessarily be a negative development. Countries will still hold most of the aces in restructurings. The IMF has tallied more than 600 sovereign restructurings in 95 countries between 1950 and 2010. Giving creditors at least one trump to play may on the margins encourage better behaviour.Any government concerned by the case’s implications can modify or remove the pari passu clauses in future bonds or avoid the New York jurisdiction altogether – perhaps in favour of London, where courts could choose to disregard the US precedent.A side-effect may be to encourage vulture funds. But in spite of the opprobrium being heaped on these investors, experts for the most part agree that the problems they cause are outweighed by the benefits they bring: Funds such as Elliott are the “bad cops” of sovereign bond markets. The threat of legal battles makes defaults less attractive and encourages countries to treat creditors slightly better when they do have to restructure.“I wonder why other sovereigns don’t gang up on Argentina and say, ‘for God’s sake stop this, you’re ruining it for all of us,” says one experienced sovereign restructuring expert. “I’ve been doing sovereign restructurings for 30 years and countries have generally had it good. That could change now.”
258;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Argentina unmoved on debt ‘holdouts’;;The Argentine government has vowed only to pay creditors who restructured their debt and has ruled out a new default as it does legal battle with holders of defaulted debt seeking full repayment.The prospect of default sent a chill through debt markets after a US appeals court on October 26 upheld a New York court ruling that Argentina could not pay the holders of its defaulted debt it restructured in 2005 and 2010 without also paying the “holdouts”. These are led by NML Capital and have been suing since Argentina halted payment on nearly $100bn in 2001.The value of some of Argentina’s restructured debt has sunk by a third since the October ruling and one-year credit default swaps (CDS) have soared as the market bets that Argentina will be forced into a technical default, despite having the cash and willingness to pay its performing debt.However, the appeals court ruling remains on hold pending clarification expected this month from New York Judge Thomas Griesa on the mechanism via which Argentina pays the exchange bondholders, such as the Bank of New York Mellon, and the impact on third parties.The judge, who received filings from Argentina and interested parties on Friday and will hear from NML on Monday – has promised to rule “well in advance” of Argentina’s next bond payment, on December 2.In a brief filed 15 minutes before a Friday midnight deadline, Argentina did not say it would not pay the holdouts, but asked Judge Griesa not to lift a stay blocking payment until appeals had been settled.Argentina has vowed to pursue all legal avenues right up to the US Supreme Court.The Argentine government even submitted an affidavit from Francisco Eggers, national director of the National Bureau of Public Credit, as requested by the judge, saying Argentina would take no steps to evade the February ruling. Judge Griesa has threatened unspecified sanctions if Argentina fails to comply with court orders.Nonetheless, Hernán Lorenzino, economy minister, told pro-government newspaper Página 12 on Sunday that Argentina “of course” stuck by its position of not paying a cent to the holdouts.“Our creditors are those who participated in restructuring offers in 2005 and 2010. Those who took part made big sacrifices. From the standpoint of our obligations and fairness, Argentina can have no other position other than to stick to our commitments. We are going to continue to oppose any alternative which goes beyond this,” he told the newspaper.He added: “Argentina cannot and will not enter into default.” Argentina maintains financial speculators want that to happen to collect on CDS. Argentina’s view is that the holdouts were offered fair treatment – entering into the exchange – and the court ruling could now offer them a better deal.The knotty issue that Judge Griesa have to unravel is not only how much money the holdouts would be due under the principle of equal treatment, but also how such a payment could be enforced.He has said some of the money Argentina sets aside to pay exchange bondholders needs to go to holdouts under the equal treatment clause, but Argentina says it is wrong to treat financial institutions involved in the servicing of its exchange debt as “aiders and abettors”.Argentina and the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM), which acts as payment agent and trustee for the exchange bondholders, say once payment leaves government coffers, it legally belongs to the bondholders.The bank said the court need to tell it what to do in the event of a court ruling that forced it into the stark choice between having to renege on its duties as bondholders’ trustee or paying them and being in contempt of court.The exchange bondholders, led by Gramercy, a large fund, fear becoming collateral damage in the bitter fight between Argentina and NML, which is part of Paul Singer’s Elliot Capital Management. While NML had the right to seek to set a “judicial mousetrap” they said in their brief, “the exchange bondholders’ lawful and exclusive property cannot and should not be used as the cheese”.If Argentina decides not to pay money to BNYM, the exchange bondholders warned of “a cataclysmic default that will further unsettle the already fragile global economy, and unquestionably spur an avalanche of follow-on litigation”.Argentina also says paying the holdouts would make it hard for any other country ever to restructure debt, and says the effectiveness of New York legislation is at stake here.

260;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-11-17T16:00:26Z;Argentina makes case in holdout row;;"No big surprises in the flurry of briefs in Argentina’s debt holdout saga then.A quick recap: a US appeals court on October 26 upheld a court ruling by New York Judge Thomas Griesa that opened the door to Argentina making some payment of the “holdout” creditors led by Elliott’s NML Capital, which spurned its 2005 and 2010 restructurings of the nearly $100bn on which it defaulted in 2001. Judge Griesa had ruled on the basis of an “equal treatment” clause.But the appeals court sent the ruling back to the judge to clarify the payment mechanism and its impact on third parties.Everyone but NML had to submit their briefs by midnight on November 16; Elliott replies on Monday and the judge has said he will then seek to rule “well in advance” of the first of three upcoming Argentine debt payment starting on December 2.One of the key concerns expressed by the parties is whether Judge Griesa will lift a stay freezing payment of the plaintiffs before the case goes back to the appeals court.Here is a quick synthesis:1. Fair treatment, false urgency?: Argentina, as expected, told New York Judge Thomas Griesa in its brief filed about a quarter of an hour before the deadline that it had offered NML Capital, the US fund it calls a “vulture”, equitable treatment when it offered to restructure its defaulted debt. “They cannot now use that refusal as a basis for obtaining, in the name of ‘equal treatment’, far better treatment than the exchange bondholders” it said in its brief. It said the plaintiffs were trying to whip up “false urgency” and urged the judge to “allow the Republic and all potentially affected third parties to prosecute their appeal rights before any orders go into effect”.2. “Magic pot of money”: NML reckons that with more than $45bn in central bank reserves, Argentina can more than afford to pay. That’s not the point, argues Argentina, adding that reserves are not “a magic pot of money to be tapped by plaintiffs”. It added: “Plaintiffs’ unprecedented demand for over one billion dollars from the fiscal reserves of a foreign state, with further demands to follow as more ‘me too’ plaintiffs pile in, had the immediate, intended effect on the market of sending it into disarray,” it said.3. Not Argentina’s agent: The court can’t touch payments to the exchange bondholders via the Bank of New York Mellon because there is “not a scintilla of evidence” that it is an agent of the Argentine republic, Argentina says. BNYM, which is the agent of the bondholders and their trustee, Argentina argued, agreed wholeheartedly with this point in its own brief. An “erroneous ruling” could cause grave injury to exchange bondholders, the BNYM and financial institutions, Argentina added.4. Between a rock and a hard place: that’s where BNYM considers itself to be: If money sent by Argentina via BNYM to pay the exchange bondholders is diverted to pay holdouts, then it is breaching its trustee duties to the exchange bondholders; if the court rules that holdouts must be paid but BNYM pays the exchange bondholders normally, it would be in contempt of court. “Simply put, BNY Mellon could be subject to multiple conflicting obligations, with a threat of contempt, on the one hand, and a claim for breach of the Indenture [its contract to pay exchange bondholders],” it said in its brief, and appealed for the court to spell out how it should act and also “confirm that BNY Mellon is under no obligation under the terms of the Indenture to make payments to the Holders in the event that Argentina violates the terms of the Injunction [i.e - if Argentina is ordered to pay the holdouts but does not]”.5. We’re not the cheese: The exchange bondholders (EBH), led by Gramercy and representing more than $1bn of exchange bonds, amassed a group of other creditors (and said eight others were interested in joining but had not had time). They feel caught in the crossfire between Argentina and NML. But as they said in their brief: “A judicial mousetrap designed to secure a remedy for the Plaintiffs is entirely appropriate. But the EBHs’ lawful and exclusive property cannot and should not be used as the cheese.” In a court hearing a week ago, Judge Griesa appeared to give short shrift to the exchange creditors.6. Snowballing crisis: If Argentina decides not to transfer the money due to the exchange bondholders to BNYM in order to get around any court order, then brace yourselves for “a cataclysmic default that will further unsettle the already fragile global economy, and unquestionably spur an avalanche of follow-on litigation involving the EBHs, multiple banks, and the Republic, which may be the intended consequence of Plaintiffs’ motion” , the exchange creditors said. Their brief added: “Plaintiffs will therefore be successful in their efforts to goad this Court into “solving” a $1.3 billion problem affecting fewer than 0.92% of the original foreign denominated Bondholders, by creating a potential over $20 billion problem affecting 100% of the Republic’s Bondholders (to say nothing of the collateral effects on the skittish and frail international markets).”7. We’re pensioners, not vultures: Law firm Duane Morris filed an amicus brief in support of NML, saying it represented Italian defaulted bondholders, many of them retirees, who were real people not “vultures” – the term the Argentine government uses for funds like NML which picked up some of its defaulted debt for pennies after Argentina’s crash. It supports NML in the face of Argentina’s “recalcitrance”.8. Affadavit: Judge Griesa had sought an affidavit from Argentina that it would comply with court rulings and not seek to evade them. Francisco Eggers, the national director of Argentina’s National Bureau of Public Credit supplied it. However, Cristina Fernández, the president, and other government officials have vowed not to pay vultures a single dollar.The saga continues.Related reading:

261;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-11-15T16:46:36Z;Argentina creditors criticise US court;;Creditors who bailed out Argentina in 2005 and 2010 by swapping their defaulted debt say they are being “attacked” by a US court ruling that could plunge their new bonds into default, and they will appeal to the US Supreme Court if necessary.One of the world’s most intractable sovereign default litigations is approaching a New York courtroom denouement, due by the start of December. Argentina and other interested parties – including Bank of New York Mellon, which is the restructured bonds’ payment agent – are preparing to file their briefs to Judge Thomas Griesa on Friday.The creditors who swallowed Argentina’s tough restructuring have hired David Boies, the attorney who represented Al Gore in his Supreme Court battle for the US presidency in 2000.Their concerns come amid a legal fight between Argentina and so-called “vulture funds” led by NML Capital, a subsidiary of Elliott Capital Management, which spurned the restructuring and are holding out to collect in full, despite having picked up some Argentine debt cheaply after the default.Creditors have seen the value of the restructured bond maturing in 2033 plunge more than a third to just 56 cents in the dollar on Thursday, the lowest since the nadir of the financial crisis, since a US appeals court on October 26 upheld a ruling by Judge Griesa that Argentina cannot pay them without also paying the holdouts.Restructured creditors feel “held hostage” as Sean O’Shea, a lawyer for Gramercy, a large emerging market fund, complained in court last week.“A New York court should not have the right to attack my property. This case raises issues all the way up to the constitutional level,” Robert Koenigsberger, Gramercy founder, told the Financial Times.The judge now has to work out a payment formula, and has promised to rule “well in advance” of a slew of forthcoming bond payments of more than $3bn by Argentina starting on December 2. NML said in a court brief on Tuesday that Argentina could post a bond of $1.45bn – covering the sum the plaintiffs claim in this case – to protect its December payments from seizure, and argues that, with $45bn in central bank reserves, the government can afford to pay.John Peta, co-head of emerging market debt at Threadneedle, a London-based asset manager that holds restructured Argentine bonds, says the court’s ruling “flies in the face of common sense” and could imperil future sovereign debt restructurings.However, he urged Argentina to pay the holdouts to avert a possible default on the rest of its bonds. “It’s better to … pay the holdouts something than go through the massive headache a default would cause,” Mr Peta said.Argentina this week filed a petition to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for the October 26 ruling to be reviewed en banc – by all 13 justices. The October ruling had been delivered by a three-judge panel. But Eugenio Bruno, a lawyer who represented bondholders who restructured their debt, noted that such an en banc petition had only been granted in eight cases out of 27,000 between 2000 and 2010.“This procedure in the second instance is complementary and independent of the presentation Argentina will make on Friday,” said Adrián Cosentino, Argentina’s finance secretary.But in its brief NML said: “Argentina has no legitimate excuse for further delay.”Market fears of an imminent default were reflected by a jump in one-year credit default swaps, to 5,499 basis points, on Thursday. Brokers say several hedge funds have made money by snapping up Argentine CDS, but declined to say which funds.The question of any default also remains murky: Argentina could argue that once it makes the payment to Bank of New York’s Argentine office, the first link in the payment chain, it has fulfilled its obligations. That issue will be for the Americas determinations committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association – on which Elliott sits – to examine.Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, has vowed the vultures will not see a single dollar.“The entire world is watching ever more closely … a confrontation between a law-abiding country and government that honour their debts and pay them as they are due, and a group of speculators who insist on flapping their wings like vultures, ” Jorge Argüello, Argentine ambassador to the US, said in an open letter to Elliott owner Paul Singer.It was not immediately clear how the Second Circuit appeals court would respond. Argentina argues that no creditors will have any incentive to take a “haircut” in a debt restructuring if the courts tell countries they must pay holdouts.But Matthew Parish, a partner at international law firm Holman Fenwick Willan, said “the idea that by restructuring, you could somehow wipe out the rights of the holdout creditors strikes me as insane”.This article has been amended since original publication to reflect the fact that Jorge Argüello is the Argentine ambassador to the US and not the US ambassador.
262;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-11-13T19:05:19Z;BNY Mellon unit settles Madoff charges;;Victims of Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme are set to receive proceeds from a $210m settlement between a Bank of New York Mellon subsidiary and US authorities, the New York attorney-general has said.US officials said on Tuesday that the settlement, together with money recovered by Irving Picard, the trustee handling the liquidation of the Madoff estate, should compensate investors “for all or nearly all” of their original investment.Madoff was sentenced to 125 years in prison in 2009 for running the world’s largest Ponzi scheme, which defrauded customers of about $20bn.Eric Schneiderman, New York attorney-general, said that Ivy Asset Management, a BNY Mellon subsidiary which advised clients to invest with Madoff, had agreed to settle allegations it breached its fiduciary duty.“An investment adviser should apprise its clients of risks, but Ivy deliberately concealed negative facts it uncovered in its due diligence of Madoff in order to keep earning millions of dollars in fees,” he said. “As a result, its clients suffered massive and avoidable losses.”The New York attorney-general, together with the Department of Labor and private plaintiffs accused Ivy’s now-defunct advisory business of advising clients to put money with Madoff despite internal concerns about his fund’s actions.As part of the settlement, Ivy did not admit or deny wrongdoing. “Ivy is pleased to have reached an agreement that allows it to put these matters behind it,” said Douglas Squasoni, chief investment officer of Ivy.Ivy was paid more than $40m between 1998 and 2008 to give advice and conduct due diligence for clients with large Madoff investments, the attorney-general said. Mr Schneiderman’s office quoted an internal email between Ivy staff with one saying: “Ah, Madoff, you omitted one possibility – he’s a fraud!”The office of the attorney-general filed a complaint in 2010 charging Ivy with fraudulent conduct and breach of fiduciary duty. The attorney-general said that Ivy questioned Madoff over an advertised strategy that required him to trade more options than the size of the market and received three “vastly different” explanations.Legal action is continuing three years after the fraud came to light, with various companies facing lawsuits from a variety of claimants. On Monday HSBC settled a case in Dublin with Kalix Fund, which had sued the bank for $35.6m alleging it was responsible for safeguarding money it placed in Thema International Fund, which invested with Madoff. Thema itself has sued HSBC.Mr Picard has received 16,519 claims as of November 2 from investors requesting compensation for their losses, according to the trustee. In September he announced $3.6bn would be distributed to claimants.
263;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-11-07T17:28:22Z;Brasilagro to issue ADRs in New York;;Brazilian farm group Brasilagro will on Thursday begin trading American Depositary Receipts on the NYSE in the first such listing in New York from Latin America`s biggest economy in three years.Brasilagro Companhia Brasileira de Propriedades Agrícolas said it was listing the certificates without engaging in a capital-raising to lift its profile among overseas investors.Brasilagro, which controls more than 180,000 hectares of Brazilian farmland, said it “would be the first Brazilian agribusiness company to list certificates of its shares on the NYSE”.The listing breaks a long drought in new ADR issuance on the NYSE by Brazilian companies, which have also suffered from a freeze on listings in their domestic market.Brazil has hosted just three initial public offerings this year, led by the $1.7bn issue by BTG Pactual, the homegrown investment bank, which chose to list global depositary receipts in Amsterdam.In total, Brazilian companies raised $4.9bn through all share offerings in the first nine months of this year, the lowest volume since 2005, according to figures from Dealogic, the data company. This represents just over 10 per cent of the peak volume reached in 2010, when Brazilian companies raised nearly $45bn.“This important moment shows the maturity of the company and will help to increase its exposure to the full universe of investors,” Brasilagro said.BNY Mellon, which acted as custodian to the deal, said there were four or five new ADR listings in the pipeline for the NYSE, without disclosing their names.But the bank acknowledged the market for new depositary receipts remained slow amid political uncertainty in the US over issues such as the fiscal cliff. “When global and emerging market trading activity slows, which is what we are seeing right now, the DR business slows,” said Gerald Hassell, chief executive of BNY Mellon on a visit to São Paulo.“We’ve seen these cycles before, almost like weather cycles they get shorter and shorter, but I expect it will come back as more of the economies around the world get stronger.”Brazilian companies are increasingly looking for deeper pools of liquidity in which to raise capital amid tighter fundraising conditions at home. The listing of a depositary receipt without a capital-raising helps position a company to be able to issue shares quickly when market conditions allow, BNY Mellon said.
264;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-10-31T21:04:14Z;New York court backs Argentina into corner;;Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, boasts that she is a good lawyer. Her government will need all the legal skill it can muster after a US appeals court ruling forcing it to contemplate two scenarios it has always declared anathema: paying litigious bondholders 11 years after falling into the world’s biggest sovereign default, or defaulting again.The US ruling last Friday is not, by any means, the end of the so-called “holdout” saga that has virtually blocked Argentina from international capital markets since its 2001 default on nearly $100bn of debt. “But the ball’s in Argentina’s court,” says Miguel Kiguel, an economist.By ordering it to give equal treatment both to the holders of new debt issued in 2005 and 2010 in a tough restructuring and to those who spurned the exchanges and have been suing to recover the original bonds’ face value in full, the court has potentially backed Argentina into a corner.If Judge Thomas Griesa, the lower court judge who must now work out the mechanism to grant equal bondholder treatment, orders Argentina to share payments on the restructured bonds with the holdouts, Argentina risks missing the full payments due on the 2005 and 2010 debt and ending up in technical default.To avoid that, it could settle with aggressive US “vulture” funds who bought defaulted debt for as little as 15 cents on the dollar and who are demanding to collect in full. But as Hernán Lorenzino, Argentina’s economy minister, said: “We’re never going to pay the vulture funds. Anyone who thinks otherwise hasn’t understood a thing.”So what can Argentina do? “They will try every argument known to man,” said Carolyn Lamm, a partner at law firm White & Case, which represents Italian retail holdouts who also rejected the offer of 30 cents on the dollar in 2005 and 2010.Argentina will certainly argue that it is legally barred from making the holdouts a better offer than the restructuring, in which nearly 93 per cent of defaulted debt was swapped. Argentina painted that as a good faith ending to a sorry saga.It could get Congress to lift a so-called “lock law” to reopen the swap, but it is hard to see how that would placate US funds like Elliott, described by one fund manager as being “on the darker side of the force”. Its NML unit won an injunction on October 2 leading to the seizure of the Libertad, an Argentine navy training ship, in Ghana in a major embarrassment for Buenos Aires.Standard & Poor’s downgraded Argentina’s sovereign debt on Tuesday, deepening a market sell-off that saw the price of the benchmark 2033 discount dollar bonds and others issued in the restructuring sink up to 7 per cent. Meanwhile, credit default swaps, which insure against default, rose nearly 5.8 per cent in cost earlier this week and the risk of owning Argentine government dollar debt, measured by the extra yield demanded over US Treasuries, surged past 1,000 points.But the case has wider ramifications, according to Guillermo Nielsen, who as finance secretary helped oversee the 2005 swap. Ordering money paid by Argentina to bondholders through the Bank of New York Mellon to be shared with the holdouts could constitute interference in the new bonds’ contracts, he said.Until Judge Griesa determines the payment mechanism, it may be too early to assess the next move for Argentina, whose international reputation remains blighted by the holdouts issue, continued default with the Paris Club of creditor nations and the threat of sanctions by the International Monetary Fund for faulty inflation and growth statistics.Argentina’s next payment is due in December but the real default risk may not be until March, analysts say. A technical default would reduce capital inflows. This would hurt growth prospects in a country already reliant on funding from the central bank and pensions agency, suffering stagflation and operating with tight foreign currency restrictions in place.“If they continue on the current path it will result in . . . a reliance on domestic debt that will rapidly result in a 1989 style internal debt default,” noted Joshua Rosner of investment research firm Graham Fisher. In that year, Argentina devalued its currency by 88.5 per cent, postponed payments on state-issued debts for two years and made a mandatory exchange of some certificates of deposit for US dollar bonds.Argentina’s fate is being closely watched in the event of other defaults. Most emerging market bonds now contain so-called “collective action clauses” to force a collectively agreed settlement on any holdouts.However, Timothy DeSieno, a partner at Bingham McCutchen, a law firm, noted: “That makes it more expensive to play the game, but you can still play it.”
265;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-10-31T19:14:18Z;Poor by default;Argentina’s stonewalling of foreign creditors is costly;It has long been an article of faith for Argentina’s government that it will never negotiate with those creditors that held out against restructurings of the country’s defaulted dollar bonds in 2005 and 2010. So determined is the president, Cristina Fernández, to have no truck with those she deems to be “vultures” that she has even written this commitment into law.Unfortunately for Ms Fernández, her pledge has collided with US law, under whose provisions the original bonds and their restructured successors were issued. A New York court has ruled that Argentina must pay $1.4bn owed on unrestructured paper to some hedge funds. The ruling dismisses the idea that Argentina has the power to discriminate between those investors who accepted the restructuring and those who held out. In effect, Ms Fernández must either repeal her law and repay the hated vultures or default on the whole lot – restructured or not.True, it remains questionable whether the judgment will in practice be enforced. In theory, what gives it teeth is that Bank of New York Mellon – which, as custodian, distributes Argentina’s bond payments – can be charged with “aiding and abetting” if it does not comply. But this may not stop Argentina seeking to frustrate it – perhaps by seeking to reroute the payments, although this itself may be fraught with legal perils.In a sane world, Buenos Aires would revisit its iron refusal to settle with foreign claimants. (In addition to snubbing the holdouts, it has defaulted on almost $10bn of debt owed to the Paris club of sovereign creditors.) This has not only led to a series of embarrassing judgments against Argentina, including the recent impounding of a naval vessel in Ghana, it has also left the country’s inhabitants with among the highest borrowing costs in the world.But Ms Fernández seems more likely to respond by wrapping herself ever more tightly in the Argentine flag. Her government is drifting fast towards an almost certainly ruinous policy of autarky, with the nationalisation of the main oil company, YPF, and imposition of currency and import controls. Her bitter fight with Clarin, Argentina’s biggest media group, hints at an increasingly intolerant attitude to critics.Ms Fernández, who likes to play the victim, typically says all her problems are of someone else’s making. Yet this is a convenient rewriting of recent history. Like the debt ruling, most of these problems are of Argentina’s making, or even her own.
266;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
267;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Ruling raises fears of Argentine default;;An unexpected New York court decision has raised the spectre of an Argentine government default, causing a rise in the cost of insuring against a payment failure and rattling the country’s bond market.The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York late last week ruled that Argentina was legally barred from prioritising payments to bondholders that participated in debt exchanges in 2005 and 2010.The case had been brought by Elliott Capital Management and Aurelius Capital Management, two hedge funds that declined to participate in the past restructurings. They hold defaulted debt with a face value of $1.4bn.But Argentina has pledged never to negotiate with the holdouts, calling them “ vulture funds”, and is barred by a so-called “lock law” from making any better offer than it did in 2005 and 2010.The hedge funds could try to target Argentina’s interest payments on the two exchanged bonds, which are paid via the Bank of New York Mellon. But unless Argentina increases its payments it would leave less for the restructured bondholders and lead potentially to a technical default.“If the order goes into effect, Argentina would essentially be prevented from making payments on their external debt,” Citigroup analysts Jeffrey Williams and Guillermo Mondino said in a note.With an appeal to the US Supreme Court possible it is still unclear how the saga will end, but investors increased bets that another default could be at hand, and sold Argentina’s bonds this week.The cost of credit default swaps on Argentine debt rose from 974 basis points on October 25, before the court decision was announced, to 1485bp at the end of Monday, according to Markit. The data provider did not have updated CDS prices for Argentina by late Tuesday in London.The price of the restructured bond maturing in 2033 fell from more than 81 cents in the dollar before the court decision was announced last week to a low of 69.75 cents in the dollar on Monday, before recovering some of its losses to trade at 71 cents on Tuesday. This equals an annual yield of 12.38 per cent.The price of Argentina’s $6.85bn domestic bond maturing in 2017 has also tumbled, to 78.1 cents in the dollar on Tuesday, for an annual yield of 13.8 per cent.HSBC analysts point out there are no coupon payments due on external debt until December, and said in a note that the court’s decision was unlikely to affect these.“While we also do not expect any more news in the short term coming from the US, we could see negative reactions coming from Argentina given the recent stance showed by the [government],” the bank’s analysts noted.
268;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-10-28T02:32:04Z;New York braces for hurricane Sandy;;Financial institutions in lower Manhattan were set to implement contingency plans as New Yorkers braced for the arrival of hurricane Sandy.The lower tip of Manhattan, which is vulnerable to flooding, houses a number of financial institutions including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon.The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which houses 1.3 million share certificates in Manhattan’s Financial District, was testing computer systems at alternative locations and employee communications systems, and preparing to implement their business continuity plan if the storm disrupts travel.Michael Bloomberg, New York mayor, said at a briefing on Saturday night that unless there was any dramatic change in the course and strength of the hurricane, the calm weekend weather was expected to worsen on Sunday night with light rain and wind building into Monday.He said that he was not ordering any evacuations in the city. Although authorities were expecting a large surge of water, it would not be a tropical storm or hurricane-style surge but rather “a slow pile up of water”.“So it will be less dangerous – but make no mistake about it, there will be a lot of water and low-lying areas will experience flooding.”Based on its trajectory, the mayor said the storm was expected to hit landfall a “bit south” of New York, into the Maryland and the Delaware area on Monday night.A decision would be made late on Sunday on whether schools would open on Monday, he said. Public transport officials would also announce any decisions about possible closures or reductions to mass transit by Sunday afternoon.“As of now, all City offices will be open and all City employees are expected to be at work on Monday. Monday will be a regular work day,” Mr Bloomberg said.By Monday night power outages might occur, coinciding with the storm surge.If the hurricane acts as predicted, Tuesday could be the most dangerous for wind and rain.Major US airlines were offering fee waivers to customers wanting to reschedule their flights through to Wednesday.Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York state, declared a state of emergency on Friday to allow the state and local government to better co-ordinate their responses. He also asked President Barack Obama to declare a federal disaster to allow the state to access federal funds and emergency management resources.Meanwhile, the New Jersey Department of Treasury said on Friday it would postpone a sale of $2.6bn in short-term debt planned for Tuesday.“A storm of this magnitude, were it to make landfall in New Jersey on Tuesday, will definitely affect our ability to get the best price for our short term notes,” said Andrew Pratt, a spokesperson for Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff.For traders, the weekend will be spent watching for further updates on the progress of hurricane Sandy as it makes its way up the east coast.“If the exchange is open I will be here,” said Ken Polcari, a NYSE floor trader who lives in Westchester, a suburban county. “The exchange is very good about sending out notifications and we will all be watching that over the weekend.”The last time NYSE closed because of bad weather was September 27, 1985 for hurricane Gloria, which made landfall on Long Island.A spokesman for Nymex, which is based near the Hudson River in Battery Park, said: “We have plans in place to ensure the proper functioning of our markets. We will continue to monitor the situation and will notify customers, market participants and our employees as appropriate.”Deutsche Bank, which has its US headquarters on Wall Street, said on Friday: “We’re watching the situation carefully”.One institution that plays a critical role in the financial system is Bank of New York Mellon, which is a custodian in the repurchase or repo market.In the wake of the World Trade Center attacks in September 2001, the operation of the repo market was severely hamstrung as trade records were destroyed and communication networks were impaired.“We are monitoring the situation closely and working on contingency planning with our groups, ensuring a lot of our employees can work from home, and we are prepared to move operations [including tri-party repo] to other global locations,” said Ron Gruendl, spokesperson at BNY Mellon.In midtown Manhattan, the Nasdaq Exchange, centred in Times Square, has prepared to invoke its emergency plans.“We have fully rehearsed our business contingency plans for all critical operations, facilities and staff,” said Joseph Christinat, a spokesperson for Nasdaq.Reporting by Michael Mackenzie, Gregory Meyer, Tracy Alloway and Shannon Bond in New York
269;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-10-17T13:39:38Z;BNY Mellon shift towards collateral services;;Bank of New York Mellon said it is hoping to offset some declining fees through growing demand for so-called collateral “transformation” services.The world’s biggest custody bank reported an 11 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to $720m in the three months to September, thanks to rising stock prices which helped boost clients’ assets as well as a lower tax rate. But continued low interest rates are pressuring the fees the bank is able to earn from its clients.Custody banks benefit from higher fees as the value of their clients’ assets increase. But they have seen their profit margins eroded by low rates, which wreak havoc with customers such as money market funds, and also decrease the amount of money the custody banks make from so-called securities lending.Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA, described the recent slide in BNY Mellon’s servicing fees for securities lending and foreign exchange as “a bloodbath” and “the lowest percentage of those fees to assets under custody in [BNY Mellon’s] history.”BNY Mellon is aiming to offset some of the decline in traditional fees through its new “global collateral services group”. The group plans to offer collateral “optimisation” and “transformation” services for its clients ahead of new regulation.New requirements to clear derivatives trades are expected to create the need for trillions of dollars worth of extra collateral in the financial system – spurring a cottage industry of banks willing to provide associated collateral services.Derivatives users will find themselves having to post high-quality securities as collateral to central clearing houses. Banks including BNY Mellon, Northern Trust and JPMorgan Chase are offering to switch non-eligible types of collateral for higher-quality securities that can be used at the central clearing houses.“Many of these things, particularly on the optimisation side and the transformation side, actually can reduce the capital cost to both sides, both the dealer side and the buyer side. And when you reduce capital costs, there’s ability to get some good revenues out of that,” Gerald Hassell, BNY Mellon chief executive, said on a conference call.However the transformation services have also proved controversial.Manmohan Singh, the International Monetary Fund economist, warned in the Financial Times this week that the growing market for “collateral transformation” services is “reminiscent of the mid-2000 securitisation in the housing market”.“It’s still early stages in terms of the fee revenues that we’re seeing actually translate or show up in our own revenue stream,” Mr Hassell said. “But we are optimistic and hopeful that this will be a significant item in the future.”Shares of BNY Mellon rose 5.5 per cent to $24.86 in afternoon trading in New York.

271;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Euro hit after IMF cuts growth forecast;;The dollar strengthened and the euro hit an eight-day low amid risk aversion in the currency markets after the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecasts for the eurozone and global economies.The single currency lost 0.7 per cent to $1.2860 on the second day of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers, amid protests in Athens during a trip by Angela Merkel, German chancellor, to discuss the country’s financial situation.Risk appetite failed to recover after the IMF on Monday downgraded its forecasts for global growth from 3.9 to 3.6 per cent in 2013.Investors also remained concerned about Greece’s ability to meet its funding commitments after EU finance ministers called on the country to take more action before the next EU summit on October 18.The yen clawed back earlier losses against other major currencies. The single currency was 0.8 per cent lower at Y100.76 while the Australian dollar fell 0.1 per cent to Y79.76. The US dollar was 0.1 per cent lower at Y78.22.The UK pound hit its weakest level in a month on negative data for the UK economy, losing 0.2 per cent to a session low of $1.5973.The Swiss franc weakened against the euro following reports that BNY Mellon and State Street intended to charge clients 25 basis points on deposits held in Swiss francs or Danish krone. The euro hit a session high of SFr1.2145 and was later 0.1 per cent higher at SFr1.2109.However, analysts questioned how long the effect on the franc would last.“We doubt the news will have a lasting weakening effect on the Swiss franc given that interest rates have been negative in the interbank market for months, and those who wish to hold Swiss franc deposits for safe haven reasons are unlikely to be deterred by a 25-basis points penalty,” said analysts at UBS.Meanwhile, the South African rand regained some losses against the US dollar after steep falls in the previous two sessions on investor concerns over the effect of mining strikes on the South African economy. The dollar fell 1.6 per cent to R8.7572.
272;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-08-29T00:16:38Z;Fidelity promotion cements family control;;Fidelity Investments promoted Abigail Johnson to president of its key businesses, putting her in place as the clear successor at the Boston based asset manager still run by her 82-year-old father, Edward “Ned” Johnson.Ms Johnson was named president of Fidelity Financial Services on Tuesday, handing her oversight of the core operations: asset management, retail and institutional brokerage, and the administration of retirement plans and benefits.Previously, the 50-year-old Ms Johnson had been head of Fidelity’s distribution business, which includes brokerage and retirement.Ronald O’Hanley will remain president of asset management and corporate services.Mr O’Hanley will now report to Ms Johnson, a move which cements her position as the next in line, but does not answer the question of many industry observers as to why Mr Johnson is yet to fully hand over the reigns at a company he has run for 45 years.“During her 24-year career at Fidelity, Abby has gained a breadth of experience overseeing many of the divisions that comprise Financial Services,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement.The group, founded in 1946 by his father, Edward Johnson the second, is one of the world’s largest privately held financial institutions. Measured by assets under management, the group is half the size of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager with $3.5tn. However, Fidelity’s broader range of businesses meant that last year it made higher revenues and earnings than its listed peer, with operating profits of $3.3bn on revenues of $12.8bn.As an organisation, Fidelity says it embraces the Japanese philosophy of Kaizen, or continuous improvement. The move follows a corporate reorganisation two years ago into the two main business segments that bought in Mr O’Hanley, a former president and chief executive of BNY Mellon asset management.

275;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;‘Financial plumbing’ faces new hurdle;;The order accusing Standard Chartered of hiding 60,000 secret transactions with Iranian companies highlights the intricacies of the world’s payment clearing system and creates new hurdles for the banks which provide such financial plumbing.Big custodian banks such as Bank of New York Mellon safeguard investors’ assets and provide basic services including clearing payments and settling transactions. While the custody business has been tricky for years, analysts say this week’s allegations against StanChart could lead to further headaches for the industry.StanChart, which is headquartered in London but has extensive international operations, is accused by the New York state’s Department of Financial Services, of concealing $250bn worth of payments cleared by the bank on behalf of a number of Iranian companies.“Global custodian banks act on behalf of their clients as users – rather than as providers – of post-trade processing services,” says Brad Hintz, banking analyst with AllianceBernstein. “It is the sub-custodians [such as StanChart] that actually perform the ‘operational plumbing’ of the global custody business.”Sub-custodians function as a network of payment processors, able to funnel money and trades from far-flung markets to larger custody banks headquartered in New York.Mr Hintz estimates that BNY Mellon may rely on StanChart for its businesses in Bangladesh and Taiwan. Northern Trust and State Street, the two other custodian banks, are exposed to StanChart in markets including Botswana, Ghana and Kenya. JPMorgan Chase, which has its own large custodian business, is exposed in countries including India, Pakistan, South Korea and Thailand.Big custody banks may now “fall under increased scrutiny” from their clients, says Mr Hintz. “Standard Chartered, despite its well-regarded capabilities in emerging markets back office operations, could quickly become a liability to the US custodial banks.”The order also highlights the importance of New York as a financial centre for such operational services. StanChart has a New York banking licence that allows it to clear US dollar payments through the Clearing House Interbank Payment System, a New York-based system known as “Chips.”Chips is one of two payment transfer systems for large transactions in the US, handling about $2tn worth of dollar payments a day. Fedwire, run and owned by the US central bank, is the other but it can be more expensive to use than Chips since banks must “prefund” their planned payments at the start of every day.“In the [unlikely] event that the NY DFS banned Standard Chartered from operating in New York it could instead use Fedwire to clear global US dollar trades provided that it is not banned from operating in the US by the Department of Justice or Federal Reserve,” says Cormac Leech, analyst at Liberum Capital.StanChart says it was one of the first non-US banks to join Chips and now clears about $195bn worth of dollar payments a day – making it the seventh biggest clearer of US dollar transactions in the world.The Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or Swift, is the equivalent system for international payments and transfers. The DFS says StanChart camouflaged Iranian payments by altering Swift codes on wires sent to the US.For many years the US allowed its local banks to process special transactions with Iranian financials and other companies. The transactions, known as “U-Turns”, effectively allowed non-US countries to trade with Iran using dollars, and route those transactions through the US, under certain strict conditions.However, according to the DFS order, StanChart disguised payments that would not have qualified as U-Turn transactions by removing and then replacing the Swift codes.StanChart “provided step by step ‘wire stripping’ instructions for any payment messages containing information that would identify Iranian clients”, the DFS says in its order. Later the bank set up an “automated process” that would electronically disguise New York-bound wire transfers for its Iranian clients, the DFS says.StanChart says that “well over 99.9 per cent” of its transactions with Iran complied with the U-Turn regulations. “The total value of transactions which did not follow the U-Turn was under $14m,” the bank said in a statement on Monday.The DFS was able to issue the order against StanChart because of the bank’s New York presence. The department regulates a number of other financials with New York state banking licences including Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon.Now the DFS is threatening to revoke StanChart’s New York licence, which would take away its ability to clear dollar payments through Chips.That could prove painful for a bank which specialises in international trade finance, as well as hit larger custody banks higher up in the financial system.“It’s definitely a leap to automatically implicate everybody in the food chain,” says Glenn Schorr, banking analyst at Nomura. “It’s a painful, annoying process to change your custodian or sub-custodian. But I think that based on the outcome of how badly Standard Chartered might have acted, certain companies might not have a choice.”
276;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Repsol in legal action against BNY Mellon;;Repsol has launched legal action against Bank of New York Mellon after it failed to carry out its voting instructions when electing the board of YPF, the expropriated Argentine oil company in which the Spanish energy group retains a stake.In a filing with New York’s Supreme Court on Wednesday, Repsol said BNY Mellon, the custodian of almost half the Spanish group’s 12 per cent stake in YPF, did not vote as Repsol had instructed it to at a shareholder meeting in June.This meant that Repsol was unable to vote with its entire stake in YPF, which the company said resulted in it only being able to elect one nominated director, the Spanish lawyer Luis García del Río, rather than three.“Repsol has suffered irreparable harm and the value of its minority interest in YPF has been significantly diminished,” the filing said.Repsol is already pursuing legal action against Argentina over its seizure of YPF, seeking at least €10bn in compensation after the populist government of Cristina Fernández forcibly nationalised YPF, seizing most of Repsol’s 57 per cent stake.The move sparked a diplomatic row between Madrid and Buenos Aires, and forced Repsol to sell assets and change its strategy to cope with its reduced size.The Spanish group then received another 5.38 per cent in YPF after the Argentine Peterson Group, which had borrowed money from Repsol to buy a stake in YPF, defaulted on its loans, taking the Spanish company’s total holding to 12 per cent.Repsol said it had submitted a request over voting for YPF directors on May 30, but BNY Mellon refused to carry out the vote on its behalf as it said the instructions had arrived after an internal deadline.BNY Mellon said it had no immediate comment.
277;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-07-23T16:36:20Z;Euro falls to two-year low versus dollar;;The euro continued to suffer as Spain’s ailing regions requested emergency aid from the central government and the prospect of a sovereign bailout loomed.The single currency fell by more than 0.5 per cent against the US dollar to touch a fresh two-year low of $1.2067, before paring some of the losses to end the session nearly flat.The euro was not helped by a report from Der Spiegel that the International Monetary Fund had signalled to Brussels that it would no longer partake in financial aid for Greece.As a result, Athens could run out of money as early as September, said Bank of New York Mellon’s Simon Derrick.Jens Nordvig of Nomura said: “We could be switching from an environment of broad-based euro weakness and generally stable risk premiums towards an environment of euro weakness concentrated against the dollar and renewed increases in global risk premiums.”Other analysts pointed to decreasing levels of repatriation flows into the eurozone, particularly into France.Strong repatriation flows have previously provided support to the single currency.The persistent eurozone fears kept the euro near a 12-year low against the Japanese yen, down 0.4 per cent from Friday to Y94.22, even as Jun Azumi, the Japanese finance, minister reiterated his stance against rapid yen appreciation.“As I’ve been saying, I will take decisive steps against speculative movement of excessive volatility,” said Mr Azumi.Commerzbank analysts said: “The markets remained unimpressed, so Japanese policy makers are likely to step up their efforts against a strengthening of the yen if the appreciation trend accelerates.”The single currency rose against sterling, up 0.4 per cent to £0.7806, but stayed near the three and a half year low that it hit before the weekend.Sterling fell 0.7 per cent against the yen to Y121.46 as the Japanese currency benefited from the risk-off atmosphere and the pound also slipped 0.7 per cent against the dollar to $1.5502.The dollar index rose 0.2 per cent as it was buoyed by the flight to havens.
278;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-07-18T23:52:58Z;US regulators warn of tri-party repo risk;;US financial regulators have taken aim at a key bank funding market, warning of “structural vulnerabilities” that could aggravate systemic risk.The so-called tri-party repo market, in which banks pledge securities as collateral for mostly overnight loans from investors, has concerned regulators for years. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been working to reform the system.But in a new report, a panel of US regulators, called the Financial Stability Oversight Council and chaired by the Treasury secretary Tim Geithner, said on Wednesday that industry pledges to reform the system were “unacceptable” and called for greater government involvement.Officials are worried because the market is dependant on two banks to clear the transactions. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon provide temporary credit to help market participants roll these loans over on a daily basis and replace them with new ones.The New York Fed had commissioned an industry taskforce to fix the issues that concerned policy makers the most.Earlier this year, the taskforce delivered recommendations that failed to deal with the issues effectively and asked for several more years to improve tri-party repo market.FSOC “views this proposed timeline as unacceptable”, the regulators said in their latest annual report on the US financial system.While the industry’s efforts in reforming the system have been “important”, they “do not meaningfully reduce reliance on intraday credit from the clearing banks,” the regulators said.Regulators have “great concern” that the industry is overly reliant on the provision of intraday credit from JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, that some market participants employ weak risk management practices and that there is no way to ensure an orderly liquidation of transactions should a large dealer default.The New York Fed said on Wednesday it would continue to monitor the market to ensure that participants were making progress in reducing systemic risk.Separately on Wednesday, the FSOC formally announced that it had designated eight financial market utilities as “systemically important”. The companies, which range from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, will now be subject to heightened requirements . However, industry officials do not yet know what that will entail.
279;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BNY Mellon profits hit by settlement charges;;Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s biggest custody bank, reported the third consecutive decline in quarterly profits due to low interest rates and a legal settlement.Second-quarter net profit fell by more than a third to $466m, or 39 cents a share, in the three months to June, BNY Mellon said. Profit was eroded by $212m, or 18 cents a share, because of a legal settlement related to Sigma Finance, the complex debt fund that collapsed during the financial crisis. Quarterly revenue also fell, down 6 per cent to $3.62 billion from $3.85 billion.The lower earnings are likely to increase analyst concerns over custodian banks’ business models in the face of low interest rates. The banks invest and manage money on behalf of clients but their profit margins have also been reduced by interest rates at record lows in the US and the European Central Bank’s recent rate cut.“I think we can hold these levels,” Tom Gibbons, chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts. “We do have some headwinds here because we do tend to leave some money at the European central bank and in the past that would have received a little bit of an interest rate. We won’t see that going forward for the foreseeable future.”The three big trust banks – BNY Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust – have responded to the continued interest rate pressure by cutting costs and building new business. State Street earlier this week reported a 4 per cent drop in net profits to $480m, while Northern Trust reported an 18 per cent increase in net income to $179.6m, helped by lower expenses and new acquisitions.Record levels of assets under custody of $27.1tn were not enough to boost profit at BNY Mellon, however. The company’s net interest margin - a key measure of its profitability – fell to 1.25 per cent from 1.41 per cent in the second quarter of last year. The bank is already implementing a programme aimed at reducing expenses by $700m.There’s “not a whole lot” that the company can do to expand the margin, Mr Gibbons told analysts. The bank has already been investing some of its portfolio in higher-yielding assets, including securities backed by home mortgages.BNY Mellon has also started a global secured lending programme, which enables it to lend out clients’ assets in exchange for fees, and is building up more esoteric financial businesses such as collateral management and transformation.“We also see some opportunities, for example, in trade finance as you have had a number of folks exit,” Mr Gibbons said. “That’s another area that we would be looking to push.”The ECB earlier this month reduced its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.75 per cent from 1 per cent and cut its deposit rate from 0.25 per cent to zero, putting further pressure on money market funds, important clients for custody banks.BNY Mellon’s fees from investment services fell 5 per cent to $1.7bn after the company sold one of its business and waived more fees for money market funds.Shares in the company rose 1.3 per cent to $22.01 in early New York trading.Analysts had expected BNY Mellon to report adjusted profit of 52 cents a share. The reported results equate to adjusted earnings of about 57 cents a share, said Howard Chen, analyst at Credit Suisse, meaning BNY Mellon beat estimates by a modest five cents.
280;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-07-15T03:33:12Z;Clouds gather over money market funds;Zero rates threaten viability of money market funds;"In March, a European Commission green paper raised the spectre of the continent’s money market funds being forced to scrap their cherished constant €1-a-share structure and instead adopt the variable pricing model common to the rest of the asset management industry.If the doommongers are to be believed, a different branch of Europe’s governing apparatus may achieve exactly the same effect.Earlier this month the European Central Bank took the unprecedented step of slashing the interest rate on its deposit facility from 25 basis points to zero, alongside a cut in its headline interest rate.Until last week, when the cut was implemented, banks had been keen to borrow short-term, often overnight, cash from money market funds and earn a carry by depositing it with the ECB.But with this option no longer viable rates have plunged, with some banks now paying zero or negative yields for anything up to three-month money.This move will eat into the already pitiful yield ultra-conservative money market funds are currently generating; euro government funds boasted an average running net yield of just 2bp, even before the ECB announcement, according to iMoneyNet.Any further reduction in yields threatens to make funds lossmaking. And while any losses are likely to be very small the repercussions could be far more damaging – funds’ constant net asset value structure simply cannot cope with any meaningful loss without “ breaking the buck”, a seismic event in money market circles.“The real prospect of negative yields for euro-denominated money market funds threatens the ability of a fund to maintain a constant NAV. This may prompt a manager to move the pricing framework to a variable NAV in order to offer investors a product that reflects the negative yield environment,” says Michael Eberhardt, senior analyst at Moody’s, who described the ECB’s move as “dramatic”.The head of MMFs at one big player adds: “This is uncharted territory. Even in the depths of the Japanese crisis we did not see [deposit rates] go to zero. Investors are not used to negative rates.”His counterpart at another large house says the US Federal Reserve has toyed with a similar step, but backed away because of fears of unintended consequences.The initial reaction of the industry has been to close, or at least soft close, funds to new money to avoid the returns of existing investors being heavily diluted by a need to buy paper with a zero or even negative yield.JPMorgan, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Insight, BNY Mellon, Northern Trust and RBS have all imposed restrictions on at least some of their euro-denominated funds.Jonathan Curry, chairman of the Institutional Money Market Funds Association, says this situation is not unique, with some funds also suspending subscriptions in late 2008 when dollar rates fell to very low levels.Aymeric Poizot of Fitch Ratings suggests these suspensions will be lifted when funds’ current portfolios have matured and been reinvested at the prevailing rates, meaning existing investors will no longer be diluted.However, the problem of extremely low yields will then become even more entrenched. Most observers believe the next step will be for sponsors to cut or even waive their fees entirely, as has happened in the US, in an attempt to keep yields in positive territory.Douglas McPhail, investment director at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, says Swip is likely to cut fees on its euro fund from 10-12bp to 8bp. However this can only take funds so far.“They can consider fee waivers, but if the overall gross yield is negative anyway, it doesn’t matter if you are waiving your fee,” says Alastair Sewell, a director in Fitch’s fund and asset management rating group, as net yields would still be negative.One manager told FTfm they would close their funds and return money to investors if gross yields became negative, rather than break the buck.Mr Sewell concurs. “A soft close is the first step towards liquidating a fund. Ultimately if a fund cannot create capital stability as a CNAV fund then you need to liquidate the fund and return money to shareholders. I don’t think we are there yet.”In common with its peers, Swip has been grappling with extremely low yields since the ECB launched its €1tn longer-term refinancing operation in December, which flooded banks with liquidity, drastically reducing their reliance on money market funds.As a result, it is pushing its Sterling Investment Cash Fund, a VNAV fund that takes more duration risk than CNAV funds can and boasts a running yield of 1.3 per cent, without taking additional credit risk.“These are the types of funds that will probably flourish. I think it’s a positive solution for investors that are concerned about lack of yield,” says Mr McPhail.Other managers report discussions about creating more bespoke separate accounts, allowing at least some money to be exposed to more credit or duration risk in return for a higher yield.However there may be another option. If the entire CNAV sector shuts its doors to new money, some managers believe clients would have no choice but to put their cash on deposit with a bank, even if the return is negative.If so, there is reason to think they would be willing to accept a negative return from a CNAV fund, if that could be constructed.One large house told FTfm it was examining structures that would allow investors to pay a higher fee, but with those expenses pulled outside the fund, allowing the fund itself to maintain a constant NAV."
281;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rate cuts exert pressure on euro;;The euro fell below $1.22 for the first time since 2010 as analysts said last week’s rate cuts by the European Central Bank were putting significant downward pressure on the single currency.The euro hit a session low of $1.2165, extending its losing streak after the ECB cut headline rates 0.25 per cent last week and, more importantly, cut the deposit rates it pays to European banks by 25 basis points to zero.Analysts said the resulting disillusionment with the euro, with money market funds restricting new investments, helped to explain why the single currency was falling even as Italy’s borrowing costs fell at an auction on Thursday.Chris Walker, foreign currency analyst at UBS, said: “The euro has really dislocated itself from the wider markets over the past week. It points towards structural outflows out of Europe and we’ve seen some evidence of that.”BNY Mellon said its trading desk had seen sharp outflows from the euro in recent days with the main beneficiaries being the Swiss franc and the US dollar.The dollar was broadly stronger after the release of minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee showed a mix of views on monetary policy, damping expectations of a further tranche of so-called quantitative easing in the near future.The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.5427 while the dollar rose 0.3 per cent against the Swiss franc to SFr0.9841.The Australian dollar made large losses against the US currency, falling 1.2 per cent to $1.0126 following weak employment data.The Australian dollar was also weaker against the yen, falling 1.7 per cent to Y80.31, as the Japanese currency strengthened after the Bank of Japan announced only a small addition to its asset purchase scheme.The US dollar fell 0.6 per cent to Y79.27, the euro lost 0.9 per cent to Y96.64 and sterling dipped 1 per cent to Y122.29.The Bank of Korea surprised markets with a 25bp rate cut to 3 per cent, citing downside risks to growth. The dollar rose 1.2 per cent against the won to Won1,154.
282;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Banks face swaps threat after ratings cuts;;Sovereigns, banks, deals – the whole financial system relies on ratings provided by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.So when Moody’s downgraded 15 of the world’s biggest banks last month, many financial institutions and investors were focused on the wider impact a rating drop would have on the derivatives swaps agreements at the heart of many structured finance deals.The issue centres on the fact that banks often act as counterparties in interest rate or currency swaps that are put in place to hedge against risk in structured finance deals such as asset-backed securities, covered bonds, residential mortgage-backed securities and collateral loan obligations. The swaps themselves are not rated, but they are designed with trigger points that are set off when a counterparty falls below a minimum ratings threshold.The concern is that a downgrade of a bank counterparty will ultimately lead to a swath of downgrades of structured finance deals, potentially forcing up the cost of funding for banks as investors demand more for lower rated deals.So far there have been relatively few new structured finance bond issues to test the water. Transaction downgrades have also largely been avoidable. But some of the ways to dodge a downgrade of a transaction incur additional costs for the banks involved.Banks such as Citi, Morgan Stanley and RBS, whose ratings have fallen below single A or the A2 threshold, have already indicated they are likely to have to post millions or even billions of dollars of additional collateral to support transactions, including swaps, that breached ratings triggers.There are other ways to avoid transaction downgrades. Last month, for example, the Sorin Real Estate CDO [collateralised debt obligation] switched its counterparty bank on a swap transaction from Citi to Bank of New York Mellon.Alexander Batchvarov, international structured finance strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, says: “Banks have known for some time that they would be downgraded and anybody who thought it would have no broader impact was clearly wrong. It is a function of the way deals operate that banks may act as swap counterparties, servicers, trust account holders.”He says while structured finance transactions have been affected, many deals have been restructured to minimise the impact of a downgrade of one entity involved in a swap.Roberto Henriques, head of European financials credit research at JPMorgan, agrees that the immediate impact of the bank downgrades has so far “not been hugely disruptive as the market was braced for the new ratings landscape”.Banks have managed to avoid unwinding transactions, mostly by increasing the amount of collateral posted in order to compensate for lower ratings. On structured credits, banks have explored options such as replacing the swap counterparty or finding a guarantor with a minimum rating.Matthew Jones of S&P says some counterparties have replaced themselves with subsidiaries located in a country where they have a higher rating.“We’ve seen other situations where institutions have amended the minimum ratings requirement because ultimately nothing has really changed. There hasn’t been a default of the structure,” says Mr Henriques.But Ed Grebeck, chief executive of Tempus Advisors, worries that the shrinking number of highly rated counterparties poses a risk: it points to market concentration. “It means less players than before. There were 10 you could go to and maybe there are five.”Others argue that with the field of highly rated participants narrowing, banks will inevitably have to deal with lower rated counterparties.Andrew South of S&P says the market is getting used “to a new environment in which counterparties on swaps have lower ratings [than before] and the structured finance transactions they are contained within are not rated AAA”. The change in the rating environment, he says, could even lead to a switch in the way structured finance deals are constructed.Issuing fixed rather than floating rate bonds, for example, would avoid the need for an interest rate hedge in some ABS deals.In May RCI Banque, the banking arm of carmaker Renault, went a step further and constructed an automotive ABS without any swap – an unusual move but one that analysts say could be repeated.S&P, Fitch and Moody’s – which last week asked for comment on the debate – are clearly taking the counterparty issue on swaps deals seriously and have released a host of updates on the subject. But they are keen to point out that transaction downgrades are not a given.Moody’s approach to counterparty risk on swaps is unlikely to have an impact on the rating of the majority of structured finance transactions, says Edward Manchester of Moody’s, but there could be exceptions.The impact of bank downgrades has “not been catastrophic” and the market in most cases has moved ahead of the rating curve but Mr Henriques warns of other clouds on the horizon.He says regulatory pressures such as the European Commission crisis management directive, which will see the burden of a failed bank shift from taxpayers to senior unsecured bondholders, will lead rating agencies to further downgrade banks.In the long-run “funding costs are only going to go in one direction,” says Mr Henriques, and that’s up.
283;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-07-06T20:31:03Z;BNY Mellon pays to end $280m Sigma case;;Bank of New York Mellon has become the latest bank to settle a lawsuit relating to Sigma Finance, the complex debt fund that collapsed during the depths of the financial crisis.The world’s largest custody bank agreed to pay up to $280m to settle allegations that it imprudently invested and lost customer money in Sigma, BNY Mellon said on Friday. The bank said it expects to take a pre-tax charge of $350m in the second quarter because of the settlement, which is subject to court approval.Sigma was the last of the infamous “structured investment vehicles,” or SIVs, when it failed in October 2008. Such SIVs borrowed cheap money in the short term commercial paper market and then invested in higher-yielding assets such as repackaged debt to make a profit. But the vehicles were hard-hit in the crisis.BNY Mellon had invested some of its clients’ money in medium-term debt issued by Sigma as part of the custodian bank’s securities lending programme, which reinvests the cash that clients earn by lending out assets such as stocks and bonds.CompSource Oklahoma, the compensation insurance company which filed the class-action lawsuit, alleged that BNY Mellon failed to invest the cash collateral “conservatively and prudently” when it bought the Sigma notes on behalf of clients.JPMorgan Chase agreed earlier this year to pay $150m to settle a similar lawsuit.“The Sigma settlement agreement reflects the meaningful progress we are making in navigating the litigation environment that affects our company and the industry overall,” said Gerald Hassell, chairman and chief executive of BNY Mellon. “We are putting this litigation behind us, with no significant impact on our capital position, while continuing to make headway on other matters.”The bank also said that it expects to increase its Basel III regulatory capital ratio by 100 basis points, as a result of recently released US guidelines.The increase is “due to the estimated reduction in risk-weighted assets related to the company’s securities portfolio”, the bank said. Credit Suisse analysts said the increase is related to a less harsh treatment of the sub-investment grade assets which make up about 5 per cent of BNY Mellon’s securities portfolio.When commercial paper markets froze in late 2008, Sigma began relying on bank financing provided through so-called “repo markets” for its funding. But when banks began to experience their own funding problems, many SIVs began to fail.Liquidators for the Sigma portfolio said in 2010 that the SIV held debt securities with a face value of about $1.9bn when the vehicle collapsed. But the sale value of the portfolio “was far below” face value and Sigma had about $6bn worth of debt, including the medium-term notes bought by BNY Mellon on behalf of its clients.
284;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Counterparties feel effect of bank downgrades;Debt deal assets may have to be downgraded;Last week, the managers in charge of a $380m collateralised debt obligation known as the “Sorin Real Estate CDO” made a decision. They decided to switch the CDO’s “counterparty” trading partner from Citigroup to Bank of New York Mellon.While the shift did not garner much attention at the time, it is indicative of an upcoming trend on Wall Street. The Moody’s downgrade of 15 global banks last week may have had little effect on bank stocks, but it is about to have a sizeable impact on the shape of the wider financial system.That’s because big banks often act as “counterparties” for the derivatives embedded in such structured finance deals – the securitised bundles of debt that act as vital sources of financing for residential and other types of loans. These derivatives – often interest rate swaps – help isolate the deals from the issuer’s other business.But the banks themselves must maintain a certain minimum credit rating to be eligible as a counterparty for these derivatives and thereby provide that protection.Without an adequately rated bank on the other side of the debt deal, assets ranging from asset-backed securities to collateralised debt obligations, a market worth trillions of dollars, will have to be downgraded too. That could lead to higher funding costs for the many, many loans that the deals help finance. While the trend of downgrading banks has been going on for some time now, especially in Europe, the sweeping review by Moody’s is likely to accelerate the process.“This is making the triple A almost unreachable in the current environment,” Jean-David Cirotteau, a credit strategist at Société Générale, one of the banks downgraded last week, lamented in a recent note to clients. A fall in the amount of top-rated triple A rated securities is, perhaps, exactly what investors and market participants don’t need right now. While many of them rail at the rather astounding missteps made by the rating agencies in the years leading up to the credit crisis, their ratings nevertheless still play an important role in markets.Ratings are embedded in everything from Basel rules, governing how much capital banks must hold, to requirements setting out which assets central banks will accept in return for liquidity support, to run-of-the-mill investment mandates. But, faced with a shrinking pool of eligible bank counterparties for their deals, issuers of structured finance securities will have to choose from three options.Like the Sorin Real Estate CDO, they can opt to switch counterparties to a higher-rated bank in an effort to maintain the credit rating on their deal.A second option is for issuers to get creative. RCI Banque, the financing arm of French carmaker Renault, structured an asset-backed deal without a swap four weeks ago, thereby stripping out the need for a counterparty bank entirely.The deal managed to achieve the much coveted triple A rating it needs in order to be eligible as collateral at the European Central Bank’s liquidity operations.But without the swap it is subject to a much higher “haircut” from the central bank, meaning RCI will get less money in return for pledging the deal to the central bank.That leaves a last option. Standard & Poor’s said at the start of the year that the financial world may have to get used to fewer triple A rated structured finance securities.There was even the suggestion from S&P that wider acceptance of non-triple A rated assets could be a good thing, forcing investors to look beyond the triple A label and do their own deal due diligence. That would avoid the blind belief in ratings that helped contribute to the recent crisis.The worry, however, is that supply is not shrinking uniformly. Faced with downgraded counterparties many issuers will choose the first option – simply moving the contracts to another, higher-rated bank. That could well see more of the lucrative derivatives business shift to the world’s remaining “stronger” banks – names such as BNYMellon, HSBC, Royal Bank of Canada or JPMorgan.That means more derivatives concentrated in a smaller number of banks, posing even bigger risks than the Lehman collapse if one of those were to ever fail.tracy.alloway@ft.com

286;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
287;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-06-04T23:54:28Z;MF Global caught up in deals tangle;;When an industry taskforce set up by the Federal Reserve decided last year to reduce the window in which short-term “repo” trades were unwound it hoped to reduce risk in the financial system.Instead, it might have helped push MF Global, the ill-starred broker-dealer, closer to collapse, according to a report by the bankruptcy trustee released on Monday.The 275-page report has focused attention on the role of Jon Corzine, MF Global’s former chief executive, in the broker-dealer’s collapse, but it has also put a spotlight on the complicated web of repurchase, or “repo”, transactions undertaken between Wall Street market participants.Repo transactions, which involve the pledging of securities as collateral for short-term loans, are often used by financial institutions to fund trading positions.MF Global used both JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon as clearing banks, according to the trustee. The two tri-party clearing banks sit between counterparties in a repo transaction and have been a focus of reform efforts to reduce the risk of the banks being touched by the failure of one of their repo clients.Last August, Wall Street firms including MF Global switched to so-called “late day settlement” of tri-party repos, at the behest of the US central bank. Late day settlement changed the way Wall Street firms settle, or complete, such trades.Instead of unwinding repo trades at the very start of the trading day, the time slot was switched to 3.30pm in an effort to limit the amount of intraday credit provided by the tri-party clearing banks, JPMorgan and BNY Mellon.While the shorter timeframe helped limit risk for the two clearing banks, it left MF Global in the lurch in October. At that point, days before its bankruptcy filing, MF Global was trying to free up extra securities from its businesses – with particular focus on the more than $5.4bn it had invested in a securities lending programme run by JPMorgan.But extricating itself from the lending programme proved a slow process.James Giddens, the bankruptcy trustee, said in his report: “[MF Global] would not be able to unwind a repo to free up eligible collateral …to close out its investment in the securities lending program until 3.30pm.” After that it would have just two hours to deliver the securities to JPMorgan.JPMorgan ended up extending $150m worth of credit to MF Global to help it unwind the securities lending programme, but even that was not enough to fully free up the funds. By October 27, MF Global’s investment had fallen to $4.1bn – and JPMorgan remained nervous about its exposure to the broker-dealer.The same day, the bank put MF Global’s accounts on “debit alert,” meaning any orders from the broker-dealer to transfer funds would need approval by JPMorgan.“The implementation of ‘debit alert’ on these accounts caused significant delay in the settlement of transactions, even when JPM ultimately determined that MFGI had ‘good funds’ on deposit to permit the transaction to settle,” the trustee said.BNY Mellon, meanwhile, placed “miscellaneous debits on its calculation” of a key measure of MF Global’s financial health, the trustee said.The amounts of the debits “appear to have been arbitrary” and “caused all [MF Global] transactions to remain pending delaying settlement until credit review and approval”, the trustee said, further complicating the company’s efforts to raise cash.Trades which did not settle, or “failed trades,” subsequently surged to more than five times their normal volume in MF Global’s final days, Mr Giddens said, as market participants shied away from completing their business with MF Global.To make matters worse, MF Global was not particularly adept at accounting for unsettled trades, according to Mr Giddens, who pinpointed outdated monitoring systems as a contributor to the company’s mishandling of customer funds.The Federal Reserve says it is still attempting to force reform of the repo market, to help minimise risk in the financial system. For MF Global, the reliance on short-term repo funding proved disastrous, according to the trustee’s report.Because most of the bank’s proprietary trades were funded through repos, even selling the positions off did not generate much cash in the near-term, as money received was typically used to repay the repo transaction backing the positions.The tangle of repo transactions, in the words of one unnamed MF Global executive, helped lead to a “liquidity asphyxiation” which overwhelmed the broker-dealer.
288;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-06-04T15:43:10Z;[Chart] EM SWFs: the old world’s newest last resort?;;"Investors have lost their appetite for IPOs. Banks are unwilling to lend. But for some sovereign wealth funds, there is hardly a crisis at all.The Qatar Investment Authority recently bought significant stakes in high-profile companies such as Shell and Tiffany’s and is eyeing a 10 per cent stake in mining company Xstrata. The China Investment Corporation recently launched a €5oom SME investment fund in Europe and is looking for opportunities in emerging Europe and Africa. How come emerging market SWFs are so active in an otherwise depressed financial world?The reason is that SWFs have a dynamic which is very different from the rest of the financial markets.Two types of countries are particularly present in the $5tn SWF industry: those with enormous revenues from natural resources (like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Russia), and those with fast growth in recent years (like China).These SWFs have been strengthened rather than weakened by their national economies. As a result, 75 per cent of the money in the SWF industry, or about $3.7tn, comes from emerging markets (see graph).Their inherent strength is driving a bullish buying strategy, says Ahmed Youssef, partner at Booz & Co in the Middle East.“When other financial institutions don’t have gunpowder to use, while you do, it’s a good time to go out and hunt,” he says. “You can buy assets that are good value, as you won’t have as much competition.”Added to this are big steps forward in transparency and professionalism made by many emerging market fund managers.This has not gone unnoticed among companies looking for investors. BNY Mellon, for example, says more and more of its clients are setting up meetings with SWFs, especially EM ones.BNY Mellon is the biggest provider in the US of depository receipt services to international corporations listing on overseas stock exchanges. Guy Gresham, investor advisory head in the bank’s depository receipt business, says a flurry of recent deals has sparked interest from his clients.“Emerging market sovereign wealth funds have made some investments in companies that spurred interest globally from other companies,” he told beyondbrics. “They wondered: ‘could these be investors we can target as well?’”Not all EM SWFs are willing investors. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, with more than $500bn under management, for example, traditionally invests in low-risk assets. Since the Arab Spring, it has switched its focus to the home front to help meet local financing needs and contain the risk of political contagion. Despite its size it is unlikely to offer much to western corporations.But other funds have fewer domestic preoccupations and are putting their money to use abroad. As EM SWFs are often relatively new to the game, there is a hope they will have a higher appetite for unconventional investments.For at least one fund, the China Investment Corporation ($410bn in assets under management), this has proved to be true. Just a few weeks ago, CIC said it would invest up to €500m in small-cap European companies interested in expanding in China. Companies would receive financial injections of €30m to €50m, an anomaly in the SWF world: stakes of $100m and up are usually the norm and direct investments in companies are rare.Still, EM SWFs are far from the be-all and end-all solution for corporate finance.More often than not, SWFs from emerging markets look exclusively for companies willing to invest in the SWF’s home market – ideally, domestic companies.“SWFs have a double mandate from the government,” says Youssef at Booz & Co. ”One is to manage the wealth of their country. The other is to create national champions.”Moreover, the spectacular under-performance of some high-profile investments, such as ADIA’s $7.5bn investment in Citi – which has lost 90 per cent of its value – has made many SWFs think twice before making such large bets.Nevertheless, in a world short of equity and credits, emerging market SWFs are among the few willing and able to make large investments in western companies. It is an ironic twist of fate that the roles between emerging and developed countries have reversed in this way. But that won’t bother the SWFs, nor the companies lining up to attract funding from them.Related reading:

289;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-06-01T19:35:45Z;Former Sentinel executives indicted;;Federal prosecutors have indicted two former senior executives of Sentinel Management Group, a Chicago-based money manager that collapsed in 2007, accusing them of defrauding more than 70 customers of more than $500m.The criminal charges outlined on Friday, which include 19 counts of fraud and one count of making false statements to an employee pension plan, compound civil cases brought by federal regulators against Sentinel executives.The federal indictment, one of the largest criminal financial fraud cases ever prosecuted in federal court, alleges that Eric Bloom, the firm’s ex-president and chief executive, and Charles Mosley, its erstwhile head trader and senior vice-president, illegally used their clients’ securities as collateral for loans from Bank of New York Mellon and other lenders.The loans were then used to purchase high-risk, illiquid securities for a “house portfolio” that benefited the firm’s senior executives and members of Mr Bloom’s family.The indictment alleges that the two executives also lied to customers about the returns on their accounts. Rather than reporting actual returns, they pooled the trading results for all Sentinel’s portfolios and then allocated the returns as they saw fit, the indictment claims.The indictment alleges that in the months leading up to the firm’s bankruptcy, Mr Bloom and Mr Mosley concealed Sentinel’s true financial condition from customers. Four days before Sentinel collapsed, the indictment claims, Mr Bloom blamed Sentinel’s financial problems on the “liquidity crisis” and “investor fear and panic”, rather than what prosecutors said was “its purchase of high-risk, illiquid securities, excessive use of leverage and the resulting indebtedness on the BNY Mellon credit line”.Eric Bloom’s attorneys, Theodore Poulos and Terence Campbell, said they were disappointed the government had brought charges against their client.“Mr Bloom had virtually all of his own personal savings invested with Sentinel, and Sentinel’s bankruptcy, which occurred almost five years ago, was caused by the massive global financial crisis that struck in mid-2007, not by any criminal conduct on the part of Eric Bloom,” the attorneys said in statement. “Mr. Bloom intends to plead not guilty and vigorously defend against these charges.”Fred Grede, the Sentinel bankruptcy trustee, told the FT that the indictment could give heart to customers of MF Global, the broker-dealer that collapsed last year.Seven months after MF Global filed for bankruptcy, some $1.6bn is still missing from client funds, money that was apparently transferred from segregated customer accounts. Most former MF Global customers are still waiting for more than one-quarter of their funds to be returned.The MF Global case has dented confidence in the futures industry, depressing trading volumes. Many in the industry feel that trust will not return unless a criminal indictment is brought against Jon Corzine, the former US senator and New Jersey governor who ran MF Global and who denies any wrongdoing.Each of the 18 charges of wire fraud in the Sentinel case carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A charge of securities fraud and making false statements to a pension plan each carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.No date has yet been set for a court appearance. The accused executives’ lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
290;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Pensions pay too much for FX;A fund of £1bn could potentially save £300,000;UK pension schemes are still paying too much for foreign exchange transacting, despite high-profile US schemes filing lawsuits against their custodians.A fund of £1bn could save £330,000 in fees for FX transactions by negotiating better rates, according to Russell Investments.David Rae, head of investment solutions, said the average cost for FX trades in 2012 was 10 basis points, but it should be as low as 1bp.He said the main reasons for higher fees were a lack of market structure, as there was no central exchange, regular trading hours or global regulator, and a lack of expertise. Also, “the bundling of FX trade fees in with other custodian services can lead to a lack of transparency on the costs of execution”.Conflicts of interest were another factor: “If your custodian bank is acting for both sides of the transaction they are not necessarily in a position to push for a competitive price,” Mr Rae said.Stephen Collins, global head of dealing at London & Capital, said many institutional investors still relied on a middle man to execute – leading to the execution, transaction and clearing costs being bundled under the spread price.“Investors should hunt around, use several providers, negotiate spreads and know where rates are trading,” said Mr Collins. “Retail can be forgiven. But institutional investors should know better.”The report’s findings are based on an analysis of more than 173,000 FX trades conducted on institutional assets over 2010/2011, with a value of about £48bn.Last year a lawsuit was filed against BNY Mellon by the State of New York and the US government over claims it had defrauded the state and other funds through FX fees over the previous decade. Florida’s state pension fund also filed against BNY Mellon, alleging it had been overcharged by $30m from 2001 to 2010.And in 2009 the Californian Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers) and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (Calstrs) alleged they had been overcharged by more than $56m over an eight-year period by their custodian State Street.
291;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-05-04T09:59:14Z;US firms rule the roost in Europe;Money market funds could be distorting the picture;The four best-selling fund firms in Europe have more than just a few things in common.Each boasts significant scale, a strong brand, and far-reaching distribution. But perhaps the most recognisable trait of each of the four firms is that they all hail from the US.BlackRock, BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, and JP Morgan Asset Management were the top-selling investment houses in Europe last year, according to 2011 figures from Lipper.BlackRock topped the charts with some €23bn ($30.5bn) of fund sales, while BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, and JP Morgan notched up €18.8bn, €12.8bn and €8.4bn, respectively.If it was not for Standard Life’s €4.8bn haul, the top seven spots in Europe would have gone to US managers last year with Goldman Sachs finishing in sixth place with sales of €3.8bn and Pimco in seventh with €3.5bn.Apart from Standard Life, the only other European firms to appear in the top-10 list were M&G in ninth with €3bn and Pictet in 10th with €2.8bn.But despite the dominance of US managers, commentators in Europe believe the apparent supremacy of American firms is little more than coincidental.“The fact that we had four US managers in the top five at the end of 2011 is probably more down to chance than anything else,” says Shiv Taneja, managing director at Cerulli Associates.He says the top five players from any one of the past three years are linked by the fact they share a “strong brand and considerable scale” rather than the country where they are headquartered.Ed Moisson, head of research at Lipper, agrees, although he adds that “timing has been crucial for the stellar sales some US groups have achieved”. Most recently, he adds, this can be seen with Templeton and Pimco, which he says have benefited from their position of being “well-established” fixed income brands at “exactly the time investors were turning to bond funds”.In terms of bond sales alone, the Lipper figures show that Franklin Templeton notched up sales of €11.9bn last year, while Pimco had sales of €7.5bn.Diana Mackay, a former senior executive at Lipper who now heads fund market research company Fund Buyer Focus, believes the inclusion of money market fund sales within the Lipper data distorts the figures, and is the reason a large number of US names appear in the list.“The US houses have a very big offering of money market funds that are dedicated to institutional clients,” she says.“This is a very different part of the business, which can distort the real retail trends in Europe, and so with the exception of Standard Life and Franklin Templeton, a considerable percentage of net sales came from money market funds,” she says, adding that more than three quarters of BNY Mellon’s and JP Morgan’s inflows are attributable to money market funds.On the fact that so few European firms appear in the top-10 sales list, she adds: “I think that the large bank-owned European groups are in a period of huge structural change, out of which you will see new players or re-dressed firms emerge.“But of the European bank-owned players – there will be groups that retain their dominant position because they have been quick to adapt to the changing market conditions.” She cites DWS and Allianz as examples of this.Ms Mackay, however, believes that European firms do have something to learn from their US peers and that “maintaining competitive strength involves taking lessons from outside”.“The US is one of the most competitive markets on the planet, and it is also the largest. To the extent that US players offer best practice models, these models will be absorbed.“However, the European markets are very different from the US, so the US models have to be adapted. Many of the big US names that have been successful in Europe have expended enormous energy and cost to adapt to local conditions, rather than imposing a US-centric approach to the industry.”A number, she adds, have also benefited from acquisitions – pointing out that BlackRock’s size is the result of the acquisition of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers and Barclays Global Investors, which itself included the large German ETF player, Indexchange.“Such groups may be US-owned but they have very strong European credentials.” In any case, she concludes, in 10 years’ time it will be “much tougher to look at success in terms of nationality”.
292;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Markets and regulator keep industry on its toes;Mutual fund leaders are facing a squeeze on expense ratios, rising costs and increased regulation;"The US mutual fund industry has no shortage of challenges, both near-term and long-term.On the competition front, exchange-traded funds and other passively managed products have siphoned off a sizeable chunk of assets from actively managed mutual funds. The shift into beta products – as well as the steady growth of fixed income assets – has put a squeeze on expense ratios. In fact, new data released by the Investment Company Institute (ICI), the group that represents the industry’s interests in Washington, shows that equity funds’ expenses have dropped 20 per cent from the 1990 average of 99 basis points.Besides a wholesale shift into lower-cost products, the downward pressure on expenses is also being felt in the retirement market. The US Department of Labour is preparing to impose new rules this summer that will give companies and their employees a much clearer view of their net costs in their retirement accounts. It is expected that the new rules will push 401(k) plan providers to compete much more on price.Meanwhile, fund groups are finding the cost of doing business continues to climb. The major brokerage houses that serve as one of the primary distribution channels for mutual funds are beginning to demand more in revenue sharing and other fees from fund advisers.On top of this, margin pressure on asset servicing firms is resulting in higher expenses for asset custody and other types of back-office services. BNY Mellon, for one, is raising fees on about 700 of its smallest asset servicing clients. For some clients, the increases could be as high as 40 per cent.Regulation is a perennial challenge for an industry whose tight oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has become one of its hallmarks. Yet the fight between the industry and regulators over possible reform measures to money market funds would seem to have a lot riding on it.The money market fund industry claims the regulations the SEC is considering would effectively wipe it out in its current form, eliminating a key source of short-term financing for businesses and local governments. The SEC and some members of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors have argued that money funds hold the potential to destabilise the economy despite a number of reforms adopted by the SEC last year.The challenges facing the US mutual fund industry will be the topic of discussion at the ICI’s 54th annual general membership meeting, to be held this week in Washington. The event’s theme, “Lasting Values – Challenging Times” and many of the panel discussions will cover the numerous issues confronting the industry.For Chris Donahue, chief executive of Federated Investors, money fund regulation poses the biggest challenge and risk to his company. By far the biggest threat, he says, is “the onslaught of regulation. I don’t think our business is unique in this, but it certainly does impact us and all of our shareholders.”Federated has responded to the possibility of new regulations by working with regulators and federal lawmakers to try to shape and influence the outcome of the reform movement. It has deployed its legal staff to offer legal commentaries in response to some of the ideas being weighed by regulators.One of the biggest gripes that Federated and others in the industry have with the looming additional regulation on money market funds is the lack of a cost-
benefit analysis to determine the economic impact of further regulation. In fact, Federated has threatened to file a lawsuit against the SEC if it does not conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis that assesses the impact of any proposed regulation.“We’re dealing with tens of millions of accounts on a very efficient business and the other side hasn’t done a cost-benefit analysis,” Mr Donahue says.As well as the threat of new regulations, Federated and all other money fund providers have been saddled with a low interest rate environment that is costing the industry a lot of money in the form of fee waivers. Low rates have pushed Federated to waive fees on its money market products to the tune of $320.7m, $241.6m and $120.6m in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Federated is hardly alone. Data from the ICI and iMoneyNet show that money funds waived some $5.2bn in fees last year while collecting only $4.7bn.Of course, beyond money funds, there is the ever-present challenge of the US market itself. The asset management industry has become so successful at penetrating the market that further growth will be tougher to come by.At the end of 2010, 23 per cent of US households’ financial assets were held in mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds and unit investment trusts, according to data from the ICI.That is up from a mere 3 per cent in 1980.The industry has also successfully entrenched itself in the retirement market, where mutual funds hold 54 per cent of all assets held in defined contribution plans. That is up from 1990, when mutual funds held just 8 per cent of DC assets, ICI data show.“We’ve probably reached the maximum level of household participation,” says Gregory Johnson, chief executive and president of Franklin Templeton. “And then it becomes a market share battle and a cost battle and margins will drop a bit.”Still, Mr Johnson says the outlook for the business is strong, but says his firm has focused on finding growth overseas. Along those lines, it last year acquired UK-based manager Rensberg Fund Management and Australian equity manager Balanced Equity Management.Franklin’s global footprint has helped it generate higher fee revenue than it could if it were focused strictly on the domestic market. The firm saw its effective investment management fee rate climb to 65.3 basis points for fiscal year 2011, up from 62.6 basis points in 2010 and 58.3 basis points for fiscal year 2009. The reason: higher levels of international assets, which earn greater fees than those earned on US products.In fact, the US industry’s asset-weighted average management fee rate on international equity assets was 63 basis points in the third quarter of 2011, according to Lipper data cited in Franklin’s annual report. That compares to management fees of 47 basis points for US assets.For all the industry’s challenges, it still offers investors a strong value proposition, says Paul Haaga Jr, chairman of Capital Research & Management. Mr Haaga, who is retiring later this year, says the fund business today is nothing like it was in 1972 when he got his start in the business.“Yes, it’s a very different industry than the one I joined when there were only 1 per cent of households” investing in mutual funds, he says.Today, the industry is highly visible and has a direct impact on millions of shareholders. What has not changed, according to Mr Haaga, is the fact that the industry continues to operate in a challenging environment.“Every time I go to the ICI [general membership meeting], each year there’s a different theme on who will eat our lunch,” he says. “The truth is we always have competition and there is always a focus on our expenses and we always need to provide real value to shareholders.”"
293;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-05-01T23:38:00Z;State case against BNY Mellon dismissed;;Bank of New York Mellon has won a legal victory with a Virginia court dismissing a lawsuit bought by Ken Cuccinelli, the state’s attorney-general, which claimed that the custody bank defrauded state pension funds through foreign-currency transactions.Fairfax County Circuit Judge Terrence Ney ruled that the state could not proceed with the action that alleged false claims by the bank under the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act.The decision follows a March ruling in a California court to partially dismiss similar claims bought as part of a whistleblower lawsuit by FX Analytics on behalf of several pension funds.“This decision and the recent dismissal of similar whistleblower claims in California underscore our long held belief that these cases will not withstand legal scrutiny,” said a spokesman for BNY Mellon.The bank has been sued in multiple states over practices in the foreign exchange trading services provided to clients such as pension funds. It has defended its business practices and is fighting the claims, which it describes as “without merit”.Civil suits continue in states including New York, Ohio, Massachusetts and Florida, while breach of contract claims remain in process in California.Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Mr Cuccinelli’s office, said that the Virginia decision was under review and that the attorney-general was considering his next action. “It is important to remember that the court’s ruling does not absolve the bank of wrongdoing.”“In fact, for the purposes of its analysis, the court assumes fraudulent behaviour by the bank, but finds that the Virginia statutes are written in such a way as to prevent that fraud from being punished under the Fraud Against Taxpayers Act,” he said.
294;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-30T17:06:30Z;Extra compensation for Arch Cru investors;;As many as 15,000 investors in the failed Arch Cru funds will be in line for an additional £100m in compensation under a redress plan announced on Monday by the City watchdog.The Financial Services Authority estimates that up to three-quarters of the investors who lost money when the funds were suspended in 2009 had received unsuitable advice.Making the first ever use of new redress powers it received in 2010, the FSA plans to order the independent financial advisers involved to contact their customers and offer compensation.The plight of Arch Cru investors has been a cause célèbre since the funds were suspended for lack of liquidity in 2009. Although the funds were UK domiciled, they were invested in a series of “cells” listed on the Channel Islands stock exchange that in turn bought everything from oil tankers and student housing to wine.“Investors need to be able to trust the advice they are given. The Arch Cru funds were high risk and they should only have been recommended to investors who fully understood and were willing and able to accept the risks,” said Clive Adamson, the FSA’s director of conduct supervision.The watchdog estimates the proposal will force IFAs to pay as much as £100m in compensation on top of the £54m that Capita Financial Managers, the authorised corporate director of the UK funds, together with HSBC and BNY Mellon, the funds’ depositaries, have already agreed to pay to Arch Cru investors.Investors will be put back into the financial position that they would have been in had they been invested in an appropriate fund.Alan Hughes, a partner with Foot Anstey who represents Arch Cru investors, called the FSA’s consultation “sloppy” because it failed to explain the balance of responsibility between the IFAs and Capita and the depositories.“Rather than looking at who is really responsible, they’ve decided they want the IFA firms to pay and they don’t care how they get there,” he said.The industry has a mixed view of the proposal, which is open for consultation until the end of July.“It’s a big hit to the sector and will cost between £6m and £10m just to administer…but at least it saves the cost of litigation,” said Chris Hannant, policy director for the Association of Independent Financial Advisers.Outside lawyers said the proposal was another harbinger of how UK regulators were moving to a more aggressive approach. The FSA has just informally split in two in preparation for the creation next year of a more powerful independent Financial Conduct Authority that will take charge of investor protection.“This announcement shows that the future has arrived,” said Simon Morris, of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna. “Requiring firms proactively to review mis-sales rather than, as in the past, waiting for complaints or requiring customers to ask for a review, will be the face of investor protection under the new regime.”
295;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-24T17:10:46Z;New trade association for US ETF industry;Nefta launches without largest ETF players on board;Exchange traded fund providers in the US have launched a trade association, but the initiative has failed to secure the support of the ETF industry’s largest players.The launch of the National Exchange Traded Funds Association (Nefta) is being led by John Hyland, chief investment officer of United States Commodity Funds, Adam Patti, chief executive of IndexIQ, and Tom Carter, president of Alps Advisors and Alps Distributors.Mr Patti, who will act as vice-chair of Nefta, said the new trade body aimed to educate investors about the benefits of ETFs and to work with regulators.Mr Patti said building membership was “a process” and that Nefta had conducted extensive consultations with most US ETF providers. More than half had already expressed strong support for the new trade body, and he hoped there would be full participation by the entire ETF industry “in time”.“We have to work hard to prove our value and to make an impact for the good of the industry,” said Mr Patti.He said it was time for the ETF industry to “speak with one voice” as there had been a great deal of misinformation published about ETFs that regulators were reacting to.However, the new trade body has not yet signed up the ETF industry’s three largest players, iShares, State Street Global Advisors and Vanguard.Jennifer Grancio, managing director at BlackRock iShares, gave a cautious welcome to the new trade body. Ms Grancio said BlackRock welcomed “thoughtful discourse” if it ultimately helped investors understand and properly use different kinds of exchange traded products.Previous attempts at starting a US trade body, such as the ETF Council launched in 2010, also failed to gain traction with the largest providers.In Europe, efforts to establish a European ETF trade body last year ground to a halt after iShares decided not to participate.US fund managers are also represented by the Investment Company Institute, which launched an ETF committee in 2008 to discuss industry issues and the concerns of regulators.“ICI partners with a number of trade associations on issues of shared interest, and we welcome Nefta’s input to the ETF discussion,” said Jim Ross, global head of ETFs at SSgA, who also acts as chair for the ICI ETF committee.However, SSgA has said no to joining Nefta.“State Street Global Advisors is a member of the Investment Company Institute and its ETF Committee, which is already working effectively to advance the interests of exchange traded funds and their shareholders,” said Arlene Roberts, a spokesperson for SSgA.Mr Patti said Nefta’s aim was to build a “big tent” that would be complementary to ICI. Important players in the ETF industry, such as the New York Stock Exchange or Bank of New York Mellon in its role as an ETF service provider, were not members of ICI but would be involved in Nefta, he added.“ICI is a wonderful organisation. Mutual funds still dwarf ETFs in the US but not all of the same issues apply,” said Mr Patti.
296;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-18T23:48:00Z;Fink warns on bank downgrades;;Senior Wall Street executives are picking winners and losers in case Moody’s Investors Service follows through with threatened downgrades of the largest banks, with BlackRock warning it might have to shift business to healthier counterparties and Bank of New York Mellon predicting it will attract deposits.Morgan Stanley, which is due to report first-quarter results on Thursday, is seen as among the most vulnerable of the 17 global banks and securities firms, whose ratings Moody’s is reviewing.Unlike Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, its biggest competitors, Morgan Stanley could be cut by as many as three notches, Moody’s has said. That would leave it at Baa2: two levels above junk status. The downgrade could hit the bank’s lucrative derivatives business. In a worst-case scenario, it could have to post an additional $6.5bn in collateral, it has said.BlackRock, the largest money manager by assets under management, said it could be forced to reduce the amount of trading it does with some banks if Moody’s cut their ratings.It said that some clients specify minimum levels of creditworthiness for counterparties to some transactions. Possible downgrades could prompt a shift to other trading partners, Larry Fink, chief executive, said in comments first reported by the New York Times.Mr Fink added that the asset manager would prefer not to move business, believing the banks to have strong capital cushions in place, but that it would have to respond to customers’ contracts. He said a move to downgrade some big banks was misplaced, and he did not understand the thinking behind Moody’s actions.Thomas Gibbons, chief financial officer at Bank of New York Mellon, said the company could see an influx of cash following downgrades of competitors. “If the rating agencies significantly downgrade other financial institutions, we may see more deposits directed here,” he said.A decision on the ratings is expected in the next month.David Viniar, chief financial officer of Goldman, said on Tuesday that he “very strongly” disagreed with some of the factors Moody’s was weighing in its decision. “We think that if you look at every single credit metric there is for Goldman Sachs, and frankly for many of our competitors, none of the actions they’ve talked about are warranted,” he said.
297;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-18T18:53:39Z;BNY Mellon first-quarter profits fall 1%;;Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s biggest custody bank by revenues, reported a 1 per cent fall in first-quarter net profits after revenue from currency trading dropped by over a fifth and low interest rates cut into earnings.The bank, charged with safeguarding and lending out clients’ assets, posted earnings of $619m, compared with the $625m reported for the same period last year. That equates to 52 cents a share – just meeting analysts’ estimates and marginally better than the 50 cents a share made last year.Still, the amount of assets under custody at the New York-based bank rose 4 per cent to a record $26.6tn, helped by the recent rally in markets and the winning of new business, BNY Mellon said.“We clearly benefited from new business coming on board and improved market values,” Gerald Hassell, chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. “We achieved that growth in spite of the fact that levels of client activity remained lower than normal.”The bank’s shares had slid 3 per cent to $23.08 by mid-afternoon in New York trading after analysts including Howard Chen at Credit Suisse called the earnings “mixed”. Revenue from currency trading fell by a fifth in the period.BNY Mellon’s two biggest competitors in the custody bank sector – Northern Trust and State Street – also reported first-quarter earnings this week. Northern Trust revealed a modest 7 per cent increase in net income to $161.2m, while State Street said that its net profits dropped 9 per cent.Like its two competitors, BNY Mellon has been shedding jobs to help trim expenses in an environment of continuing low interest rates. Lower rates wreak havoc with the bread and butter activities of custodian banks’ businesses, cutting into their ability to make money from securities lending for clients.BNY Mellon’s net interest margin – a key measure of its profitability – fell from 1.49 per cent to 1.32 per cent in the quarter. The bank said nearly half of the deposits it accepted on behalf of customers were in the form of more liquid and lower-yielding assets, which also cut into the bank’s earnings.“In a zero rate environment, it feels like about the 130 to 135 type of range is what we could squeeze out of the net interest margin,” BNY Mellon executives told analysts on the call.The bank’s expenses rose 4 per cent as legal expenditures jumped.Earlier this week the custody bank agreed to pay $6m to settle claims that it pledged ineligible securities as part of a Federal Reserve programme to help money market funds during the height of the financial crisis. The bank is also embroiled in legal disputes with the states of Ohio, New York and Virginia over so-called “standing instructions” relating to foreign exchange business.But there was some good news for the custody bank. Rating agencies including Moody’s could downgrade a raft of large banks later this year, which might help shift some more business to specialist custodians.“If the rating agencies significantly downgrade other financial institutions, we may see more deposits directed here,” said Thomas Gibbons, vice chairman and chief financial officer.
298;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-17T15:03:14Z;Northern Trust profits rise on new business;;Northern Trust’s profits rose in the first quarter as the custody bank won business and stock markets rallied.The Chicago-based group said net income rose 7 per cent to $161.2m, on revenues up 8 per cent to $965.4m, in line with analysts’ expectations, according to Bloomberg.Northern Trust also raised its quarterly dividend to $0.30 per common share, up 7 per cent on the year before, and increased its stock repurchase programme following the conclusion of bank stress tests by the Federal Reserve. The company said that it was “one of only two major US banks that did not cut its quarterly dividend throughout the financial crisis”.Non-interest expenses at the bank were 9 per cent higher than the year before, partly because of a seasonal rise in staffing costs. Like larger peers State Street and Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust has begun to restructure, cutting 700 jobs in the first quarter.Frederick Waddell, chairman and chief executive, said “expenses, excluding charges, improved sequentially, evidencing our continued efforts to improve productivity and profitability”.Assets under custody rose 5.5 per cent to $4.6tn and assets under management were 8 per cent higher at $717bn. The company continues to waive fees in its money market business while short term interest rates remain near zero, at a cost of $14m in the first quarter, a figure which is up slightly on the year before.Shares in Northern Trust were flat at $46.26 in early New York trading.
299;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-15T20:13:52Z;Global taxation: Fiscal frustrations;A clampdown on a tax structure used by banks will test US efforts to curb cross-border schemes;In November 2001, Bank of New York, a mid-tier US bank, transferred nearly $8bn of its own assets to a trust in the small, business-friendly state of Delaware through several layers of newly created companies.A mixture of home mortgages, shares and other securities, the transfer made up almost 10 per cent of the bank’s total assets of $80bn at the time. In spite of its size, the transaction did not need to be discussed with BNY’s regulators, nor was it noted in the bank’s financial statements or annual report. It had little practical effect on the lender’s day-to-day operations – the assets continued to be managed and serviced by the same group of employees in New York.But it was a critical first step in setting up a complex structure known as Stars – structured trust advantaged repackaged securities, to give its full, tongue-twisting name – which US tax authorities claim was used by several American banks as an abusive tax shelter that has cost them more than $1bn in tax revenues in the past decade.Today, BNY will square off against the Internal Revenue Service in US Tax Court convened in New York over Stars and the tax benefits the structure triggered for the US bank and UK-based Barclays, its counterparty in the deal. At issue is whether Stars was set up primarily to generate artificial foreign tax credits, as the IRS contends, or whether it was a legal way for BNY to obtain financing at rock-bottom rates.The arguments heard this week will pose a crucial test of the US government’s resolve to rein in sophisticated corporate tax planning that has sapped vast amounts of potential revenue. Tax authorities worldwide – notably in the US and UK – are under mounting pressure to show that large companies are shouldering their share of the tax burden as part of a broader political debate about fairness and corporate social responsibility.“We are upping our game in the large business area, particularly as it relates to international tax issues,” Douglas Shulman, US internal revenue commissioner, said in a speech in Washington this month.For the IRS, losing the Stars disputes would be a serious blow to its strategy in high-value cases, tax lawyers said. For the banks, the risk is financial – $900m is at stake in the BNY case alone – as well as reputational.An investigation last year by the Financial Times and ProPublica, a New York-based nonprofit investigative news organisation, first detailed how Stars produced tax benefits for US banks. In all, six banks – BNY (now Bank of New York Mellon), BB&T, Sovereign (now a unit of Santander), Wachovia (now part of Wells Fargo), Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo – participated in Stars deals with Barclays between 1999 and 2006. Five of those banks are now challenging IRS rulings that disallowed foreign tax credits generated in those transactions. WaMu has settled a dispute over its own Stars structure in bankruptcy court by agreeing to forgo $160m in claimed tax credits. In total, the IRS says, the Stars deals created $3.4bn in foreign tax credits.Now, documents filed in BNY’s case in the past few weeks provide unprecedented detail about Stars and how the structure was crafted at a time when banks and accounting firms were offering deals for multinational corporations to take advantage of loopholes in foreign tax credit rules.At the simplest level, foreign tax credits are designed to prevent US companies being taxed twice on income earned overseas by allowing them to claim credit for taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions.In the BNY case, the IRS claims the Stars structure allowed both Barclays and BNY to claim credits for the same “illusory” foreign tax charges, ultimately reducing the US government’s tax revenue by $18.15 for every $100 of income funnelled through the Delaware trust. “The record will establish that Stars was a pricey financing that no prudent banker would undertake but for the tax benefits generated by the meaningless circulation of cash flows,” according to a court filing by the IRS on March 27.BNY has argued in the case that the deal was complex but an entirely legal structure that allowed it access to low-cost financing from Barclays for its everyday business activities.Like hundreds of other foreign tax-driven transactions sold to companies in the boom years before the financial crisis of 2008, Stars was developed by Barclays’ famed structured finance group, known as Structured Capital Markets. Led at the time by Roger Jenkins, one of Britain’s best-known dealmakers, and Iain Abrahams, the expert behind most of the bank’s tax arbitrage transactions, SCM’s original concept was for Stars to manufacture tax credits for Barclays and a US corporate taxpayer by circulating US income through an entity taxed in the UK, the IRS said in its filing.…Because of the differences be­tween US and UK tax rules, Stars would allow Barclays to reimburse a US taxpayer for half the tax paid in the UK without reducing the amount of foreign tax credits that could be claimed by either party, the IRS said. Barclays is not a party to the IRS dispute with BNY and has not been accused of wrongdoing by the US authorities.According to the IRS, blue-chip US companies, including software company Microsoft and insurers AIG and Prudential Life, turned down early versions of Stars for unspecified reasons. The IRS said BNY, which bought the deal in 2001, had grown “addicted” to tax-driven transactions, which provided it with an important source of revenue.Before buying Stars, the IRS says, BNY had entered into more than 100 “lease-back” transactions – known as Lilos and Silos – that produced tax advantages. Shortly after participating in Stars, BNY also purchased from Barclays another foreign tax credit structure, nicknamed Toga, that involved high-grade debt securities, the IRS said.“Barclays understood that BNY was highly receptive to a wide range of tax-based ideas, and had targeted BNY for an SCM ‘tax product’ after discussions with BNY senior executives,” the IRS said in its filing.The IRS also described KPMG as a pivotal player to the deal. The accounting firm provided a US tax opinion blessing the structure for Barclays and sold Stars to BNY for a fee of $6m, according to the IRS filing.David Brockway, then of KPMG, was engaged to provide the firm’s opinion on Stars and is expected to testify at trial, according to the IRS. Mr Brockway, a leading US tax lawyer, left KPMG in April 2005 amid scrutiny of the firm’s previous sales of potentially abusive tax shelters.Raymond Ruble, formerly a partner at Sidley Austin in New York, is another lawyer named by the IRS as a key adviser on the structure. Convicted of multiple counts of tax evasion in a separate tax shelter case involving wealthy taxpayers in 2008, he is incarcerated in a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.The threat posed by cross-border tax schemes has emerged as one of the biggest problems facing fiscal authorities. “Aggressive tax planning – untaxed income, multiple deductions and other forms of international tax arbitrage – is a growing concern for all governments,” the OECD said last month as it launched a study into ways to tackle the problem.The Paris-based think-tank called for action on “international loopholes” that put billions of dollars at risk, citing recent cases involving New Zealand and Italy, as well as the foreign tax credit transactions that are the subject of court battles in the US.The same issue is worrying the European Commission, which recently launched a fact-finding mission into the “undesirable” competitive advantage achieved by companies able to exploit differences in the tax rules of two countries. It is considering proposals for better information sharing and new laws to eradicate mismatches.Since the 1980s there have been attempts to legislate against cross-border schemes, with mixed results. Information sharing has become more widespread, even though it may require governments to expose schemes that harm other exchequers but benefit their own.In the case of Bank of New York’s legal battle over the tax credit transactions known as Stars, the US tax authority’s trial memorandum says Barclays convinced the UK Revenue to respect its tax position in the deals, which benefited Britain. “The UK collected more tax with Stars than without Stars,” the filing says. Even so, the UK then joined forces with the US, Australia and Canada in 2004 in a taskforce that set out to unravel these and other cross-border schemes.But international co-operation has its limits. The most effective reform – harmonising tax rules to eliminate arbitrage opportunities – is unrealistic, according to the OECD. The best bet are specific laws on cross-border schemes. The OECD notes that Italy, the UK and the US have introduced rules for schemes whose purpose is to manufacture foreign tax credits. Canada is also looking at such rules even though – like the US – it believes its general anti-avoidance rule should work against the schemes.This desire for a back-up plan is a sign of the huge sums at stake. As the OECD puts it: “The magnitude of the problem warranted greater assurance.”The IRS, Barclays, BNY, KPMG and Sidley Austin declined to comment on the case before trial. Mr Jenkins, now a partner at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual, and Mr Abrahams, still a senior executive at Barclays in London, each declined to comment. Mr Brockway, now a Washington-based partner at law firm Bingham, did not respond to requests for comment.Both sides acknowledge that BNY’s Stars deal was executed through highly choreographed steps. First, BNY transferred about $7.9bn of income-producing assets to the Delaware trust through layers of newly created subsidiaries. Barclays, as the counterparty, acquired shares in the trust, giving it a right to nearly all the income generated by the assets. In return, Barclays contributed a $1.5bn loan to BNY, also via the trust.Barclays and BNY then executed a repurchase agreement, or “repo”, under which BNY agreed to buy back the shares in the Delaware trust five years later, in November 2006. BNY appointed a UK company as trustee of the Delaware trust, making the income it produced subject to UK tax.At the outset of the deal, the trust’s pool of assets were expected to generate about $460m of income a year – of which, at a tax rate of 22 per cent, $100m would be paid to UK tax authorities. When the trust income failed to reach $460m, as expected, BNY injected extra assets, essentially to top up the income stream.…At the heart of the structure are differences between how it is treated under US and UK tax law. Under UK rules, Barclays was allowed to take a deduction against its other taxable income in the UK on the condition that it immediately reinvested the income produced by the assets in the trust. But it was also able simultaneously to take a credit for the tax paid by the trust.According to the IRS, those tax benefits were shared with BNY, generating gains for both banks. For every $100 of income circulated through the trust, the US government lost $18.15, which financed BNY’s profit of $7.15, Barclays’ profit of $7.70 and UK tax receipts of $3.30, the IRS claims.But under US tax law, the deal was considered a secured lending arrangement. So under US tax rules, BNY, as owner of the UK trust, could also claim a foreign tax credit for the UK taxes paid. In 2001 and 2002, BNY claimed nearly $200m foreign tax credits from the Stars structure, which the IRS has disallowed. Including interest, the total amount in dispute is about $900m, according to the bank’s most recent annual report.“The foreign tax credits that Bank of New York claimed in the US at a 22 per cent rate were far more than the actual UK tax attributable to Stars,” the IRS says in its filing. “In other words, Bank of New York claimed credits for phantom UK tax expense.”BNY, by contrast, which is challenging the IRS’s refusal to allow the credits, says it entered into the Stars deal to borrow low-cost funds. Because of the UK tax benefits the structure generated for Barclays, BNY claims the British bank was able to provide it with the five-year $1.5bn loan at a cost that was more than three percentage points below the prevailing benchmark lending rate.“The complication was required by Barclays’ UK tax objectives, not by BNY,” the bank said in a court filing on March 27. “By lending to [BNY] through the structure that Barclays designed, Barclays could offer a very favourable borrowing rate.”In the coming weeks, US Tax Court will hear from the bankers, lawyers and accountants involved as well as a raft of experts in weighing up both sides’ positions. A final decision is not expected for more than a year.With much at stake, BNY and the IRS appear to be digging in for a protracted battle. In its latest filing, BNY accuses the government of using “emotionally laden” arguments to try to deliver a “sweet sound bite”. The IRS, for its part, says “no rational person” would have participated in Stars if it did not generate foreign tax credits.Let the war of words begin.Jeff Gerth is a senior reporter at Pro­Publica
300;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-11T17:00:42Z;Sterling sits pretty in land of the ugly;;"In the least ugly competition, sterling is looking pretty. Despite weak UK growth, the possibility of more quantitative easing by the Bank of England and the threat of a credit downgrade hanging over the economy, the pound is looking remarkably resilient.This week it hit a 14-month high on a trade-weighted basis, a three-month high against the euro and, earlier this month, a five-month high against the dollar.In the view of many investors, this resilience is because of the poor competition from other industrialised economies: the euro is dogged by the region’s debt crisis; the dollar is losing lustre after disappointing non-farm payrolls last week; and the yen is being hampered by Japan’s struggle to find growth.Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, says: “Sterling has broken a number of monthly highs and was a top performing currency in March, underpinned by some strong UK data on manufacturing and services.”But can sterling appreciate further from here, or could it succumb to selling pressure amid continuing worries over UK growth and whether the Bank of England will need to step up its programme of quantitative easing?The key perhaps lies with the eurozone and the impact it will have on the UK economy. More trouble in Spain and Italy, and sterling is likely to benefit against the single currency but struggle to make more gains against the other liquid currencies of the dollar, yen and Swiss franc.Some strategists point to the correlation between Spanish bond yields, which this week broke through 6 per cent on 10-year debt for the first time since November, and the sterling/euro exchange rate.Higher Spanish yields tend to aid sterling against the euro as fears about the eurozone drive haven flows into the pound.But a deepening eurozone crisis may be a mixed blessing for sterling against the dollar, yen and Swiss franc as the the UK economy is so closely tied to the single currency. About 50 per cent of UK trade is with the eurozone.Mr Mellor says: “It is quite possible sterling will move higher against the euro as I think there will be a new leg of the eurozone crisis, but it may have seen its highs against the other currencies. Going forward, we may also see some stronger US data, which will help the dollar.”However, other investors and strategists say sterling will benefit in a risk-off environment as there are few other places to turn to in times of crisis, particularly as the Swiss franc and yen are no longer considered as appealing by some because of worries about Swiss National Bank intervention and the state of the Japanese economy.Of the other currencies, the Scandinavian units are too illiquid to provide a real haven status while the eastern European units would probably take a hit in a deepening euro crisis because they have even closer links with western Europe than the pound.In short, more gloom in the eurozone should be a plus for sterling.Conversely, an improving outlook globally and in the eurozone could also be a plus for the pound, although such a scenario could see some switching into the commodity currencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and Norway.The only serious worry for sterling, therefore, is a rating downgrade, stripping the UK of its prized triple A status, combined with another aggressive round of quantitative easing. Both these scenarios, for now, look relatively remote.Marc Chandler, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, says: “On balance, sterling is more likely to hold its own or appreciate than take a big hit, certainly against the euro. It also has a strong haven status that should underpin it against other currencies too.”Mr Chandler, like many other strategists and investors, does not expect a big resurgence in global growth in the industrialised world. The UK and US economies are more likely to recover slowly with problems in the eurozone continuing to hold back the UK, in particular.In this situation, sterling remains an attractive option, they say. For now at least, sterling looks likely to continue winning the least ugly competition."
301;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-05T06:15:53Z;Liability move is not best way to protect investors;;From Mr Ranjit Chatterji.Sir, The Association of Global Custodians shares the asset management industry’s concerns at the proposed implementing of measures for the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive that would further extend the liability of depositaries.As custody banks responsible for the safekeeping and administration of investors’ assets, we believe that depositaries should rightly be held to the highest standards of care in the interests of investor protection. However, depositaries cannot be responsible for risks that are beyond their control as the measures currently suggest (for example, the risk of fraud by third parties).To make depositaries liable in this way would cause significant and undesirable disruption to financial markets, particularly around collateral management practices and the clearing of derivatives. It could also result in increased systemic risk. Such outcomes are markedly counter to the tenets of the Group of 20 commitments, and the regulatory response to the financial crisis.We believe that an appropriate balance can be achieved that protects investors, limits systemic risk and respects the original consensus reached on the AIFMD.Ranjit Chatterji, Chair, Association of Global CustodiansThe Association of Global Custodians includes as members the following banks participating in this letter: The Bank of New York Mellon, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J P Morgan, Northern Trust, RBC Dexia Investor Services, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Standard Chartered Bank and State Street Bank and Trust Company
302;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-04T23:07:13Z;JPMorgan’s practices bring scrutiny;;Three times a pallbearer, never a corpse – that is JPMorgan Chase’s experience of the brutal financial markets of the past few years.At the demise of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and, most recently, MF Global, the bank has been deeply involved: in a rescue bid for Bear and in a complex network of relationships with Lehman and MF Global. Its unrivalled reach raises inevitable questions about its role.On Wednesday the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined JPMorgan $20m to settle allegations that the bank mishandled Lehman’s customer funds. The futures regulator alleged the bank overextended credit to Lehman by treating customer funds as if they belonged to Lehman and using the inflated calculation to determine its credit limit. The CFTC also claimed that after the September 2008 bankruptcy it initially refused to release customer funds.JPMorgan said the amount of extra credit Lehman obtained by it “mistakenly” including the customer funds was “small relative to the overall relationship” between the banks.But the real fight over JPMorgan’s role in Lehman’s final days is set to come later this year when a lawsuit brought by the collapsed bank is due for trial. The $8.6bn lawsuit accuses JPMorgan of using its “life and death power as the brokerage firm’s primary clearing bank” to put a “financial gun” to its head and demand excess collateral. It claims JPMorgan abused its access to US government officials and then “accelerated Lehman’s free fall into bankruptcy”, hoovering up collateral to protect itself to the detriment of the firm and other eventual creditors.Arguing for the case to be dismissed, JPMorgan’s lawyers said the bank “did not cut and run” when it had the chance but stood by Lehman “while other financial players were running for the exits”.“Far from being inequitable or harming other creditors, JPMorgan’s continued extensions of credit allowed [Lehman] to survive until it could be sold to Barclays, softening the blow for [Lehman’s] customers but leaving JPMorgan with tens of billions of dollars in claims,” the bank said.In a separate but related action, Anton Valukas, Lehman’s bankruptcy examiner, found that most of JPMorgan’s actions in its role as lender to Lehman would not pose credible claims against the bank. He said there was a possible claim “but not a strong claim …that JPMorgan breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by making excessive collateral requests to Lehman”.A New York judge must now decide whether to allow the Lehman case against JPMorgan to come to a trial.Before Lehman, JPMorgan was even more deeply involved in a dying investment bank. It was on hand to scoop up the remains of Bear Stearns, saving it from bankruptcy, with financing sweetened by the Federal Reserve, which was desperate to avoid a collapse.Most recently, MF Global’s failure has raised familiar questions about JPMorgan’s role. JPMorgan acted as custodian and clearing bank for MF Global. It also administered a $1.2bn line of credit for the broker-dealer.MF Global employees including Jon Corzine, chief executive, and Henri Steenkamp, global chief financial officer “expressed frustration” with JPMorgan’s alleged delays in sending the broker-dealer money due from selling assets, according to congressional investigators.The bank’s decision to parachute its bankers into the New York offices of MF Global in its final week has also raised eyebrows in the industry. JPMorgan says the personnel were there to help MF Global unwind some of the broker-dealer’s repo transactions.“We took what we believed were appropriate and prudent steps, as part of maintaining safe and sound banking operations, to ensure that we did not wind up in a position where we had extended credit to MF Global without proper collateral and security protections,” Diane Genova, JPMorgan’s deputy general counsel has said.JPMorgan also notes that it fully funded requests for credit on the $1.2bn credit line to MF Global shortly before it collapsed even as “other financial institutions who were members of the bank group either delayed their funding or did not provide funding at all”.Some senior bankers from other banks, who declined to speak publicly about a rival, point to conflicts at JPMorgan arguing that an investment bank such as Lehman Brothers, or Morgan Stanley for that matter, should not have assets sitting with a competitor. Other rivals say JPMorgan appears to manage its conflicts properly.Some JPMorgan bankers believe a lot of this is sour grapes from lesser competitors. The bank has built a formidable presence in global finance, with unique reach. Along with Bank of New York Mellon, it is one of only two clearing banks that are agents in the vast tri-party repurchase, or repo, market that is a crucial source of short-term funding for investment banks.BNY Mellon, though, does not have the same Wall Street presence, confining itself to the relatively anodyne world of custody. JPMorgan is a colossal full-service investment and retail bank, directly competing with the likes of Lehman, MF Global and Bear Stearns until those competitors went away.
303;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-04T19:36:09Z;Big banks warn over funds shake-up;;The global banks that safeguard almost all fund managers’ assets are sounding the alarm over proposed Brussels rules for the hedge fund and private equity industries, warning they would “cause a significant and undesirable disruption to financial markets”.In a rare public statement that reflects the concern among executives, custodian banks are urging the European Commission to amend technical standards proposed for implementing the 2011 alternative investment fund managers directive (AIFMD).The banks – including typically low-key institutions such as State Street and Bank of New York Mellon – fear that rules intended to protect investors from fraud are unworkable, overstep the Commission’s mandate and will drive up costs for investors.The intervention will add ballast to public concerns aired by the fund management industry, which Michel Barnier, the European commissioner overseeing financial services, this week dismissed as “rearguard lobbying” aimed at wriggling out of long-overdue regulation.Writing to the Financial Times, the Association of Global Custodians in particular takes issue with the interpretation of rules that leave them liable for risks beyond their control, such as fraud by third parties such as brokers or registrars.“To make depositaries liable in this way would cause a significant and undesirable disruption to financial markets, particularly around collateral management practices and the clearing of derivatives,” the custodians said. “It could also result in increased systemic risk.”Custodian banks signing the letter include JPMorgan, Citi, HSBC and Deutsche Bank.EU officials see the rules as vital to give investors better protection from another Madoff fraud or Lehman Brothers collapse. But the banks complain that the Commission, in drafting the specialist rules on how to apply the directive, is unpicking some of the hard-fought political compromises that underpinned the AIFMD deal in 2011. Mr Barnier rejects the charge, saying it is the industry ­trying to “reopen old issues”.According to the banks, several provisions on collateral arrangements go beyond the directive. Custodians would in effect be responsible for brokers or clearing houses appointed by a fund manager, increasing risks and due diligence requirements.Should the rules go through unchanged, the banks believe they will overturn many market practices and contracts, and restrict investment options for fund managers, particularly in emerging markets.On some of the issues raised, the Commission is being asked better to reflect the advice of the European Securities and Markets Authority in its legal text. In others, the custodians are pressing for the Commission to amend the Esma guidance to bring it in line with the directive.The Commission said: “The Commission’s draft follows Esma’s advice. We believe Esma’s advice is in full compliance with the directive.”
304;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-04-02T20:17:22Z;Banks in spotlight over board composition;;The president of the American Museum of Natural History sits on JPMorgan Chase’s risk committee and some observers think she should not be there.CtW Investment Group, an adviser to union-sponsored pension funds with more than $200bn in assets, says it contacted JPMorgan last year to tell the bank of its “major concern” about Ellen Futter’s qualifications.Granted, she was on the board of insurer AIG from 1999 until 2008, but Michael Pryce-Jones, senior governance policy analyst at CtW, did not think serving on the board that presided over the biggest bailout of the financial crisis was a positive factor.For its part, JPMorgan says Ms Futter’s management experience and previous work as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York qualify her for the role.This is only one of many discussions taking place around the world between banks, regulators and shareholders over board composition, some of which are becoming fractious.Common questions are whether directors are sufficiently independent and qualified to hold management to account and, from the directors’ side, whether the tide of regulation and the increased risk of litigation makes the position worth the hassle.“I honestly don’t know why anybody would be on a bank board,” Sir Malcolm Williamson, a UK-based director of National Australia Bank, told a recent Cass Business School event in New York, as he suggested personal legal risk was not compensated by a typical director’s pay.The Securities and Exchange Commission is ramping up its contact with boards, adding to the regulatory burden. “There are a number of cases where important issues have not been escalated to the board. That’s problematic,” says Carlo di Florio, head of the SEC’s examination division. “By engaging the board and senior management directly, we mitigate the risk that the message doesn’t get escalated or is communicated in a different way.”This is hardly universally welcomed by directors. Elaine Chao, the former US labour secretary, took three board jobs – including as a director at Wells Fargo – after eight years serving in the previous Bush administration. She says the requirements have changed materially since she was last on a board a decade ago. “The incredible increase in paperwork requirements for new directors in the eight years of my absence has been very stark. And the discussion around the board table is also very different – most of the discussion now is: ‘What are the latest regulatory requirements and how does the company comply’.”Wells is one of the banks approached by the SEC as part of its new programme of talking to boards as well as executives. Ms Chao says: “We have had representatives of regulatory bodies come and talk to the board. They’re polite. They’re sharing their views as to what are the safeguards that are necessary.”Buts she adds: “Instead of talking about profit and loss, the board spends a great deal of time reviewing how to comply with the increased and sometimes conflicting regulatory requirements – past, present and future.”Edward Wedbush, president of Wedbush Securities, whose board has also met SEC officials, sees the regulator’s initiative as a response to its own “failures, which are somewhat embarrassing”, from the Madoff fraud to MF Global’s collapse. Though supportive of tougher industry regulation, he says he is not a big supporter of putting directors – rather than executives – “on the hotspot”.Aside from regulatory scrutiny, bank boards are considering their mix of skills. Citigroup has moved to bolster the broader non-financial expertise among directors. Wells Fargo, on the other hand, is looking to recruit more directors with bank experience.Shareholder engagement can also produce changes, though it is a laborious process. Goldman Sachs created the role of “lead director” after receiving demands for more fundamental change from a union pension fund. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees had been pressing the bank to separate the dual role of chairman and chief executive – a position held by Lloyd Blankfein.AFSCME continues to press for the separation of chairman and chief executive at other banks. Mr Pryce-Jones wants the same thing and has highlighted Bank of New York Mellon as a prime candidate.“I do think there's a very specific reason why banks need to adopt this,” he says. “When you have an independent chairman they’re really forced to know the company. Before the financial crisis, boards really didn’t have a full enough understanding of the business. They can start asking those hard questions of how much capital, how much equity do we want? What kind of asset classes do we want to be in.”
305;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-30T07:39:27Z;Funds shine light on custodians’ fees;Experts say pensions should ask tough questions about fees for FX transactions;How much money can be squeezed out of the costs incurred from currency transactions when investing abroad? A few basis points here and there, but not much.When overall returns were higher and more consistent this did not get a great deal of attention, but in leaner times there is a trend for independent audits of FX transactions – not least when one of the main sources of returns on equities has become dividends rather than growth.When the results of these audits have not been to the liking of investors there have been lawsuits against the custodians who manage these transactions on behalf of clients. The State of California issued a claim of fraud against State Street on behalf of Calpers and Calstrs in October 2009 and numerous US states have brought similar actions against both State Street and BNY Mellon subsequently.The substance of many claims is that the time of day the transactions took place has been falsified to give the pension fund a lower transaction value than when the trade actually took place.These are not the only or the first investors who are unhappy with the situation. Audits undertaken by the fund manager Record have found custodians taking big cuts from transactions since 2001, when a client first asked whether their custodian was making excessive profits from the spreads on FX transactions.James Wood-Collins, chief executive at Record, recalls: “We expected the custodian to be able to provide ‘time-stamped’ trade deals, which we could then compare with our database of live prices at 15 minute intervals. Instead, however, they were unable (or unwilling) to do so – a theme we’ve since seen repeated on numerous occasions.”Close to 100 audits for pension funds later and the same story appears.“Pension funds characteristically pay excessive spreads on FX transactions in the aggregate, and significantly more when execution is left to the custodian rather than subject to the fiduciary duty of the manager of the underlying assets,” says Mr Wood-Collins.There is no shortage of people who will agree with these sentiments. Both Mercer and Russell Investments have responded to the growing call for transparency by setting up special units to monitor or deal in FX on behalf of clients at bargain rates.Russell has carried out research on 170,000 FX transactions valued at about $83bn and found the average cost was 10.1bp. It has used this figure to highlight the 1bp average for its own specialist trading service.The 10.1bp average is a figure which both Mercer and Record think is too high for the institutional world where large sums change hands for proportionately smaller fees.Mr Wood-Collins says for institutional size trades in major developed market pairs, spreads are more typically 3 to 8bp, so the cost would be 1.5 to 4 bp – the true cost of any transaction is from the mid-market price to the price paid, i.e. half the bid-offer spread.Michael DuCharme, head of foreign exchange at Russell, argues that this is done well by specialists who by their nature have to compete on price with custodians and fund managers who have built special internal capabilities.“Trading with the custodian is a very convenient low risk way to trade, the trade-off is it comes at a higher cost.”So what will become of the custodians’ FX services, which are most frequently used for regular dividend and coupon conversions, carried out under directed trading arrangements?Benjamin Gunnee, European director at Mercer, believes they will have to change their model.“Historically custodians have ‘hidden’ fees in costs such as FX as they are not closely monitored,” he says. “As more transparency is sought on costs it will mean that the custodians’ revenue mix will change and they will have to recover their fees from other sources, albeit in a more transparent way.”More pragmatic advice for investors comes from Steve Delo, an independent trustee for many UK pension funds.He advises: “Pension funds are always exposed to the risk of getting ripped off when any fees or charges can exist which are not explicit, disclosed and fully transparent.“From my experience, I am always wary when any investment services provider bristles at questioning on fees and expenses. Clear demonstration of the facts and transparency is what is required.”
306;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-29T22:44:30Z;BofA settlement clears legal hurdle;;Bank of America took an important step toward cementing a $8.5bn legal settlement that is crucial to its future when a court rejected a challenge to the deal by Baupost, a Boston-based hedge fund.BofA has been trying to emerge from an avalanche of mortgage losses and litigation related to its disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide, the California-based mortgage originator. The bank last year agreed to pay $8.5bn to settle claims that bad loans made by Countrywide, which underpin mortgage-backed securities, breached underwriting guidelines.But that deal, cut with Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee on a set of MBS pools, and backed by investors including BlackRock and MetLife, has been challenged by other investors, including Baupost, and is waiting for a judge’s approval. If it succeeds, it could be the blueprint for other settlements, paving the way for BofA to escape its mortgage difficulties. If it fails, BofA faces a new, unpredictable wave of litigation.On Thursday, Barbara Kapnick, a judge in New York’s Supreme Court, dismissed a complaint from Baupost, which is run by founder Seth Klarman and brought the case under the name Walnut Place. Baupost had objected to the way BNY Mellon had handled its complaints about Countrywide.Ms Kapnick said BNY Mellon “did, in fact, act upon [the] complaints, as demonstrated by the settlement agreement”. A lawyer for Grais & Ellsworth, the hedge fund’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.People involved who want the settlement to succeed argued that Ms Kapnick’s decision boded well for the ruling on whether to uphold the settlement. A hearing on that is expected next month and Ms Kapnick will also decide that case. BofA said: “We’re pleased with the court ruling.”Others said it was only a step in BofA’s direction. The judge’s decision “certainly shows that the [$8.5bn] settlement is effective from Bank of New York and BofA’s perspective in consolidating the actions and forcing the litigation into this one very favourable forum,” said Isaac Gradman, an attorney specialising in mortgage litigation. “But it doesn’t necessarily suggest the judge is going one way or the other in the settlement.”Baupost said in its complaint that it had told BNY Mellon, the trustee for the MBS trusts, in 2010 that it should force Countrywide to compensate the MBS holders because many of the loans underpinning the securities had breached underwriting rules.Other complainants, including the attorney-general of New York, are pursuing BofA over the MBS. While BNY Mellon reached a settlement on behalf of investors, US Bancorp sued the bank on behalf of investors in pools of mortgages for which it was trustee.
307;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-29T13:40:09Z;Custodians come under fire over ‘excessive’ FX profits;‘Excessive’ profit by custodian banks has been drawing attention;"If there are at least two sides to every foreign exchange transaction, there are at least two sides to every story too – often diametrically opposed to one another.This is particularly true in the unfolding saga of lawsuits involving US pension funds, FX trades made on their behalf by custodian banks, and professional investment managers. In short, a small but growing number of pension funds or parties acting with their interest at heart is undertaking some form of legal action against their custodians.In the vanguard is the California attorney-general, alleging that State Street has made excessive profits from FX transactions arising from the day-to-day servicing needs of assets belonging to California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers). Virginia and Florida have filed similar suits against Bank of New York Mellon.The actions can trace their roots back to 2003, when Calpers, the world’s largest pension fund, appointed currency risk specialist Record Currency Management to analyse foreign exchange transactions.A recent paper by Record, FX Transaction Costs – Plugging Leakage in Returns, says the extent to which custodian banks profit from foreign exchange activity seems excessive to most, especially when they fail to provide proper disclosure of actual profits. Record points to the absence of time-stamps on individual trades as an important factor in the broader equation.Record says its methodology gives a statistically significant indication of poor pricing, by comparing trades with the trading day’s highs and lows. In many cases, it argues, custodians’ execution by this measure exhibits a skew either towards the day’s low or outside the trading range.It adds that FX revenues for custodians are significantly greater than those of other banks (for the equivalent volume of trades), suggesting that for similar activities custodian banks are profiting excessively.If rates are significantly skewed towards the low, or well outside the range against the sponsor, this raises questions about the competence or integrity of the execution process, concludes Record.Record makes several suggestions to limit or eliminate such activity: the publication of time-stamps for each trade; a regular audit of FX execution; and execution of FX by an independent agent.One of several important points it fails to mention, according to some observers, is the fiduciary duty of the investment managers issuing the execution instructions, without which the custodians cannot act. A second is that its methodology can attract criticism for not comparing like with like. A third is that the key parties involved are supposedly sophisticated financial professionals; it ill behoves them to express widow- and orphan-like bemusement at high-level transactional practice, rather than acknowledge their own shortcomings.BNY Mellon defends itself vigorously against any suggestion of wrongdoing. It divides foreign exchange transactions into two classifications: negotiated and non-negotiated, the latter executed under its “standing instruction service”. The bank says that rates for larger value transactions ($1m-plus) in easy-to-execute currencies are negotiated directly with clients or their fund manager representatives.The standing instruction service offers access to wholesale rates for smaller amounts and hard-to-execute currencies (Michael Billy, managing partner at Econophy Capital Advisors, the Florida-based foreign exchange risk management specialist, says: “If a trade is being done at interbank rates you can get a very efficient rate at $100,000”).BNY Mellon argues that it publishes daily the proposed trading range for transactions that are not directly negotiated, and that clients have until 11am each day to opt out if they want to use another provider. It also says many clients opt for the standing instructions programme because it allows them to transfer the cost and risk of the trades to BNY Mellon. This additional benefit does not seem to be acknowledged in the Record methodology.State Street says it also continues vigorously to defend the allegations regarding its indirect FX services made in the civil proceedings commenced against it. “We offer clients and their investment managers a range of FX execution options and transparency as to our pricing methods,” it says. “We believe that our clients and their advisers choose indirect FX as an execution option when it represents the best mix of service and price to address their needs.”State Street attached a recent press clipping highlighting the fact that Calpers signed a three-year contract in July this year for State Street to handle all its custody work. Some might say this suggests its clients do, after all, agree with the bank – irrespective of the actions of the California attorney-general."
308;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-28T16:01:19Z;Fed’s latest offering should ease forex volatility;;"The market is slated to digest more Federal Reserve chatter on Thursday; with chairman Ben Bernanke (yes, again) and some regional chiefs at the podium.Views about monetary policy may differ but it is unlikely that the most important among the orators, Mr Bernanke, will say anything deliberately designed to spook the market.That should be supportive for stocks. And it may also continue the trend of waning forex volatility (vol).Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon, notes the tight inverse correlation with vol for highly liquid forex crosses and US equities.The chart illustrates this trend with the euro/$ and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Dips in vol and rises for stocks coincided with various central bank statements and actions, such as the announcement of the Fed’s “Operation Twist” and the group effort to calm the eurozone financial system.But Mr Derrick warns: “Given the rising tensions in Spain, not to mention the French presidential election on the horizon, the risk remains that the recent period of [forex] calm may not last that much longer.”"
309;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-26T17:48:59Z;Pretending the world is fixed is a gamble;;Greg Smith did Goldman Sachs a fair bit of damage. But he probably did the rest of Wall Street a big favour. When the previously unheard-of Goldman Sachs banker penned an opinion piece in the New York Times this month – publicly resigning and condemning his employer for a craven corporate culture – it became the main topic of conversation among bankers and anyone with a passing interest in finance for days.It also detracted from a less titillating news item – the publication the day before of the latest round of Federal Reserve stress tests on the country’s 19 big banking groups. On the face of it, the tests were a ringing endorsement of the repair work done on banks’ balance sheets since the financial crisis hit five years ago – 15 of the 19 passed the regulator’s tests even after factoring in planned dividend increases they have been itching to push through, at shareholders’ behest, for the past couple of years.The outcome was embarrassing for Citigroup, the one big-name group whose dividend plans were blocked because they fell short of the passmark – a 5 per cent core tier one capital ratio under the stress scenario. But with a few other footnotes, the tests sent a clear signal – the US banking system is back in rude health.Can we really be so sure? On the face of it the tests were tough. They included a sharp contraction of gross domestic product, unemployment peaking at over 13 per cent next year, US equity prices slumping 50 per cent and US house prices falling a further 20 per cent. The Fed’s stress testing has often been hailed by critics of Europe’s copycat exercises as a model of how things should be done – far tougher, far more credible and, when coupled with an injection of emergency state “Tarp” money a few years ago, a recipe for financial recovery.This time, with the heart of the financial crisis having shifted to Europe, it is risking complacency. Yes, the Fed modelled for an unspecified “growth slowdown” and a “very significant widening” of credit default swaps on both European sovereigns and financial institutions, as well as sharp increases in spreads on European sovereign bonds. But the Fed did not model for any sovereign default or for any of the economic doomsday scenarios that should arguably have been considered. The much criticised European Banking Authority – the pan-EU body in charge of Europe’s tests – took a tougher stance.To judge US banks to be over the worst because their domestic market seems to be recovering is to underestimate the transmission mechanisms – notably unmonitored derivatives exposures – by which global banks can be laid low.All the more reason for caution, then. Yet the US has stuck with a far lower pass mark for its stress tests than the EBA. The European regulator, much to the chagrin of the region’s banks, has demanded not only a 9 per cent core tier one pass mark but has also toughened the definition of capital according to so-called Basel 2.5 rules – a halfway house between Basel II, which the US has never implemented, and Basel III, which it is promising to.If the Fed had imposed a 9 per cent pass mark, even without a tougher definition of capital, only three of the 19 banks – American Express, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street – would have passed. Worst of all is the net result of the Fed’s green light. Within hours, the big banks had announced sweeping plans to return vast sums of money to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. JPMorgan alone announced it would buy back as much as $15bn of stock and raise its dividend by one-fifth. Wells Fargo increased its quarterly dividend by more than 80 per cent.US banks, understandably, feel hard done by, what with the restrictions of the Volcker rule, the complexities of the sprawling Dodd-Frank legislation and the imminent phase-in of Basel III. But all the more reason, surely, to build up capital buffers now and make an early and thorough transition to the realities of the new world. With the economic outlook in Europe – and globally – still so uncertain, it is too early to be eating into capital by distributing so much of it to investors.It is not a problem that many banks in Europe have to wrestle with. Many are generating losses, or such anaemic profits, that dividends have been suspended or shrunk to the minimum. Committed dividend payers, such as HSBC in the UK and Santander in Spain, are having to create fresh equity even as they make payouts to existing shareholders.It is an unpopular message for shareholders in the short term. But pretending that the world is fixed, and counting on profit accumulation to refill capital buffers over the next few years, is a gamble – either optimistic or reckless depending on how bleak your view.Patrick Jenkins is the FT’s Banking Editorpatrick.jenkins@ft.com
310;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-25T06:37:08Z;Demand for mobile data growing fast;Pictet is just the latest fund manager to provide information on a mobile app;Pictet has rolled out an iPad app for investors, joining a host of other asset managers that have responded to growing demand for fund data on-the-go.The Pictet app, which is free to download from the online Apple app store, is available in seven languages, including Dutch and Chinese.According to the Swiss-based asset manager, users of the app can choose to view key fund information, such as prices, performance and risk data, while also monitoring portfolio exposures and consulting interactive charts using their mobile device. Short investment videos can also be accessed on the new application.Pictet’s launch comes after several other fund houses already made the leap into services designed to cater for the growing use of mobile devices among investors.Legg Mason last year launched an app designed for use on the iPhone, BlackBerry and Google’s Android devices. The Legg Mason app, targeted at intermediaries, provides users with regular market updates, links to latest market commentary, fund prices, videos and webcasts. The group is due to launch an app designed for use with the iPad next month.Mike Evans, head of international marketing at Legg Mason, says digital technology is now “a key part” of how the firm engages with its clients. “Part of what we are seeing is a change in behaviour and how clients consume information,” says Mr Evans.According to statistics from Kurtosys, a financial services communications firm, smartphone usage grew by 70 per cent in 2010, with 23 per cent of all time spent online being via a mobile phone.Mr Evans says there has been a particularly strong demand for Legg Mason’s fund prices via its iPhone app.“A high proportion of client hits go towards fund prices provided on our website. But the take-up of mobile is growing quickly,” says Mr Evans.Other fund management groups to have launched iPhone or iPad apps include Baring Asset Management and Fidelity, while in the US, Pimco and Vanguard have rolled out services specifically for mobile devices.JPMorgan Asset Management rolled out an iPad app to cover its European-domiciled fund range in September last year. The app, which allows investors to access historical prices, interactive factsheets, performance charts, market and investment insights and videos, is available for both the iPad and iPhone and can be used in six languages.However, it is not just asset managers that are responding to a growing demand for data delivered via mobile devices. Fund administrators and custodians are also getting involved in the scramble to launch apps.State Street’s US business launched an app called State Street Springboard last autumn. The app enables fund managers and other institutional investors to view their entire investment portfolio at a glance, including risk-exposure analysis, net asset value summaries and fund flows.In January, BNY Mellon launched an app for its institutional clients that allows access to performance and risk analytics services via an iPad. Clients can also view data such as portfolio and benchmark information, including daily and historical returns.Others are building on their existing applications. Nordea last month rolled out a series of new applications targeted at iPad and smartphone users, some 12 months after its first iPhone app was launched.The updated apps allow investors to access fund prices and fund charts, as well as calculate the return of their Nordea funds since they were purchased. Quarterly reports, fact sheets, fund manager interviews and key investor information documents are also available via the updated apps.Legg Mason’s Mr Evans expects the uptake of mobile technology among asset managers to continue. “There is a big emphasis on digital and how we can better use it to engage with clients,” says Mr Evans.“However, a lot will depend on the different companies and what they feel is right for them. There are certain applications that live better on a website, while others work better through mobile technology.”David Ricketts is senior reporter at Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
311;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-23T10:49:21Z;Short-selling ban was ‘a game-changer’;The short-selling ban changed investors’ perception of securities lending;In an attempt to rein in what they saw as speculative attacks on their banks, several European countries including Spain, France and Italy late last year adopted bans on short selling of their banks.It is hard to say whether the bans, which were lifted last month, contributed to the improvement in fortunes for European Union banks – credit would also have to be given to the European Central Banks’ refunding operation, plus a general pick-up in risk appetite.But one thing is certain: it made securities lending even more complicated.It came during what has already been a turbulent period for prime brokers’ business of locating securities and lending them to “short sellers”, who seek to sell and then repurchase the borrowed stocks or bonds to repay the loan.Annual volumes have been down from about $4.5tn before the financial crisis to some $2.5tn at the end of last year, according to BNY Mellon, thanks to low interest rates and little M&A volume.Low rates make it difficult for lenders to earn a spread, and without mergers to arbitrage, short-selling activity withers.In addition, the financial crisis has seen the model of securities lending changing. Rather than using cash as collateral, which could be invested in illiquid securities and create liquidity crunches during times of stress, other securities are now being used as a way to reduce that risk.This new model, more widely used in Europe, has put further strain on what is already a shortage of quality collateral, with US Treasuries already trading at a premium, and additional collateral being used to trade swaps as part of a G20 initiative to have more derivatives trades centrally cleared.The short-selling ban on European banks only crimped demand further, bankers and traders say, and reduced the number of participants in the market.It also added complexity to the job of prime brokers who arrange loans between agents, such as State Street and BNY Mellon, which have vast warehouses of shares to loan, and clients such as active mutual funds and hedge funds.As the ban was not applied to all countries, it meant there needed to be procedures to prevent share borrowers in one country from selling them short in another.“There is no uniform system whereby a short seller must identify themselves. If I am in France but sell it through my German broker, they can sell it as a normal order,” says Georges Ugeux, chairman of Galileo Global Advisors, a boutique banking adviser. “That is why these bans are not effective.”In one respect, bankers say the transition was simple: there was no short selling, in cash or synthetic form, of the affected stocks.“As long as the processes are there, and the traders are trained in compliance, I wouldn’t say it’s more complicated. It’s totally manageable,” says Loic Lebrun, EMEA head of equity finance & delta one at HSBC.However, there were knock-on effects. There were fewer stocks committed to lending programmes by asset management firms, who feared running foul of the rules, as well as less demand for lending services by hedge funds.According to a survey by Greenwich Associates, hedge funds with at least $1bn in assets reduced the average number of prime brokers they use, as a result of the declining need to borrow, from 3.7 to 3.3 last year.The impact was also seen in the cost to trade bank shares. The fees to lend increased, to reflect the scarcity of available supply. But broader market liquidity also was affected. Bid-ask spreads on shares in the Euro Stoxx bank index have been nearly double that of their US counterparts in the S&P 500 for the past three months, according to Deutsche Bank figures.“It has been a game changer,” says Andrew Jamieson, head of EMEA equity finance at JPMorgan Chase. “Whereas previously for mature, established markets, regulatory changes were done on a consultative basis, these happened overnight. That had an impact both with regards to retroactive changes to insure we were compliant, and for changing strategies from an investor standpoint from that moment hence,” he says.Efforts are under way to streamline European rules on short-sale bans.The European Securities and Markets Authority, the pan-European regulatory watchdog, is engaged in a consultation on technical standards for short selling across countries.It faces a deadline at the end of this month for the creation of final rules, but does not appear to be close to having a system ready to go.There is also the potential financial transactions tax under consideration in France and other countries, which could effectively “double tax” short selling by taxing the loan and the short-sale.Securities lending has, further, been criticised as part of the “shadow banking” system by a report from the Bank of England and the UK’s Financial Services Authority.In the near term, Esma’s new rules are likely to establish different rules for securities deemed liquid and those considered illiquid. For illiquid shares, the owner of the shares to be lent out will be required to place a hold on them.Eventually, that will not be a barrier to trading, once banks agree on protocols for how to manage such a process.But it will require additional investment in systems to track whether the holds are in place, and could slow securities lending, particularly in Europe, for the foreseeable future.

The consumer technology company also reported “record activity” over the weekend for sales of its latest iPad tablet.Scott Sutherland, analyst at Wedbush, reiterated his “buy” rating and put a price target of $750 on Apple following Monday’s the announcement. “Apple continues to generate significant free cash flow and will be maintaining a cash war chest to execute on strategic opportunities. We are making some minor earnings per share adjustments in [our financial year] 2013 to reflect dividends but not repurchases,” he said.The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to its highest level since May 2008 at 1,409.75 and is now up more than 12 per cent on the year. US Steel Corporation led the risers on the benchmark US index, up 6.5 per cent to $31.64.Financial stocks propelled the index to cyclical heights to start the day but retreated in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 financial sector index gained as much as 1.2 per cent before finishing the day up 0.5 per cent.Bank of America, the best performing big bank stock for the year to date, crossed the $10 mark for the first time since last August in intraday trading, but finished the day down 2.8 per cent to $9.53 as traders speculated on rumours that the bank was going to raise capital through a share offering.“Contrary to market rumours, Bank of America has no intention of issuing additional equity in a secondary offering,” said a spokesperson at Bank of America. Shares rose 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading.Citigroup climbed 1.3 per cent to $37.17 after it sold its stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, netting an after-tax profit of $349m. Citigroup has risen almost 2 per cent since last Tuesday’s close when it was revealed that it was one of four banks to fail the Federal Reserve’s stress tests.Goldman Sachs was up 1.1 per cent to $124.30 as reports said the bank was considering offering “monoline” insurance to find new ways to expand its business ahead of new financial regulations.Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $20.06, while Wells Fargo gained 1.1 per cent to $34.25. Capital One and the Bank of New York Mellon were both up more than 1 per cent at $55.10 and $24.51 respectively.E-Trade Financial, the electronic broker, was up 1.6 per cent and has now risen 41 per cent in the year to date.The Nasdaq Composite index was the best performer out of the three large US indices as technology stocks picked up momentum throughout the day. The index rose 0.8 per cent to 3,078.32 with Apple among the leaders. Close behind was Google, which added 1.4 per cent to $633.98.The day’s biggest loser was Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator by subscribers, which fell by 4.5 per cent to $2.76. The company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” in a note by Bernstein Research which cited concerns that Sprint does not have sufficient “free-and-clear spectrum” to launch its latest LTE iPhone and maintains its “punishing” commitments to Apple.Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein, said: “Unfortunately, at this point we simply don’t believe there is any analytical framework that provides strong conviction as to whether Sprint can or cannot avoid bankruptcy over the next four years or so.“To be clear, we are not predicting a Sprint bankruptcy. We are merely acknowledging that it is a very legitimate risk. And notwithstanding a recent rally in Sprint shares, we believe that risk is rising,” he added.Priceline.com, the online travel booking company, gained 3.2 per cent to $696.93 to hit a 52-week high. Netflix, the home DVD delivery and online streaming company, continued its rally, up nearly 4 per cent to $114.33.Shares in UPS, the US package delivery company, added 3.4 per cent to $81.11. Over the weekend, the company said it would acquire TNT Express, its Dutch rival, as it plans to expand its footprint in Europe and China.Las Vegas Sands, the casino company, rose 4.5 per cent to a 52-week high at $59.12 on reports that its Sands Cotai Central casino in Macao would open next month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,239.13. Bank of America led the index for much of the day before softening in afternoon trading to finish as the index’s worst performer. American Express, the world’s third-largest payments network, gained 1.3 per cent to $57.27.Economic data released on Monday showed that US housing market sentiment remained flat in March, with home builder confidence holding steady from last month.
313;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-16T16:12:48Z;Relief as banks pass Fed’s stress tests;;The biggest members of the US banking industry breathed a collective sigh of relief this week, after the Federal Reserve released the results of its much-anticipated stress tests two days early.The results, published on Tuesday afternoon, showed 15 of the 19 banks involved in the exercise passing. Four banks – Ally Financial, Citigroup, MetLife and SunTrust – failed, or did not have their plans to return money to shareholders approved by the US central bank.Despite unevenness in the results, the Fed’s announcement sent bank stocks soaring, with the S&P financials index finishing up at $211.03 this week, its highest since May of last year.Banks had to prove they could maintain a core tier one capital ratio above 5 per cent of risk-weighted assets under the Fed’s hypothetical “stress scenario”, which included an economic recession and a financial system shock. Only then would the companies be allowed to pay out dividends or buy back stock – though their “capital plans” still had to be approved by the US central bank.But the 78 per cent pass rate also disguised a wide degree of variation in payout ambitions.Bank of New York Mellon and Goldman Sachs sought only modest returns to shareholders, while JPMorgan Chase said it would buy back up to $15bn of its shares and increase its dividend.Ally, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley did not seek to return money to shareholders.“All investors should care about is did we pass,” James Gorman, Morgan Stanley chief executive and chairman, said in an event hosted by Fortune magazine on Friday. “A couple of years ago very few banks could have passed.”
314;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-09T19:54:51Z;Simplicity – Buffett’s investment watchword;Anyone can emulate Warren, says ex-daughter-in-law;"“Durable competitive advantage”, “predictability of earnings”, and a “motivating” share price are what Warren Buffett looks for in a company – and, according to his ex-daughter-in-law’s latest book, anyone can invest in the same way.Mary Buffett, left, has made a career out of studying the world’s most successful investor, having been married to his son, Peter, for 12 years. This career has seen her writing – in partnership with David Clark – eight books about Warren Buffett and his investment methodology. The latest, The Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio, was published at the end of last year.In an exclusive interview in the FT magazine Investors Chronicle this week, she claims that private investors can easily emulate Buffett Snr’s approach, if they have patience and a sufficiently long time horizon.“He made $60bn by only investing in the stock market,” she explains. “Everyone can with much less capital still get outstanding returns. Anyone can invest like Warren if you stick to the principles and discipline. It’s not rocket science, but not many people do it.”In her new book, she examines 17 equity investments that have helped him to achieve his extraordinary wealth, and reveals the four basic questions that he uses to identify a company with a durable consumer monopoly:17 Warren Buffett investments with a durable competitive advantage●American Express●Bank of New York Mellon●ConocoPhillips●Costco Wholesale Corporation●GlaxoSmithKline●Johnson & Johnson●Kraft Foods●Moody’s Corporation●Procter & Gamble●Sanofi SA●Torchmark Corporation●Union Pacific Corporation●US Bancorp●Walmart●Washington Post Company●Wells Fargo1. Will the product or service the company is selling today be the same product or service that it will be selling ten years from now? Or, as Warren Buffett puts it: “Take Wrigley’s chewing gum. I don’t think the internet is going to change how people chew gum.” Other examples are Coca-Cola and Kraft.2. Can you understand how the product works? Mary says: “Railroads, ie Union Pacific Corporation; and discount shopping, ie Walmart, are not difficult to understand.”3. Does it take large amounts of research and development to keep the service or product competitive?4. Does the company in question have a monopoly or is it the leading low-cost producer of the product or service it sells? “Predictable products equal predictable earnings,” says Mary.She explains that Warren Buffett likes to view stocks like these as fixed-income investments, because their earnings are so predictable. He calls them “equity bonds”. Once a company’s durable competitive advantage and predictability of earning have been established, the “Sage of Omaha” gauges a stock’s value by how attractively it is priced and the consistent long-term profit he believes it will bear.“We are, as value investors, price-motivated. The lower the price the higher the motivation.“It’s like in High School and you like a guy but he is going out with another girl. You wait and then make your move when they break up,” she explains. “This is the key thing that investors don’t do – know what you want to buy and then wait for it to be sold at a discount.”She advises that investors use the tools that are out there on the internet to evaluate companies. “Don’t think of it as stock. Buying a stock is buying a fractional piece of business.”GlaxoSmithKline is the only London-listed stock among the 17 highlighted companies. “It shows great consistency in earnings and rising per share book value,” she says. “Plus, it has really made its mark with Aids antivirals. For Warren and the foundations he has supported it is a natural.”Moira O’Neill is personal finance editor of Investors Chronicle. Read the full interview in this week's issue on sale now"
315;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-03-05T16:13:43Z;Economy: The aim is to spread growth beyond centre;The city has defied many bleak predictions, writes Andrew Bounds;David Partridge, joint chief executive of Argent, the property arm of the British Telecom pension fund, knows he is taking a risk.He is building a speculative office block outside London after the downturn cut a swathe through the property business. While 63,000 sq ft at Elisabeth House on St Peter’s Square in the heart of Manchester has been pre-let to KPMG, the accountancy firm, 200,000 sq ft remain.But it is a calculated risk, he says. Had he proposed speculating in any other provincial city in the UK, “I would have been laughed out of the boardroom”, he says.But Manchester has the scale, diversity and international interest to justify the move, a joint venture with the Greater Manchester Pension Fund.Add to that a multi-million pound investment by the city council to revamp the Grade II listed library and town hall on the same square and the bet looks safer.Michael Hawkins of WHR, a property consultancy, says it is a perfect example of how the council works with developers to unlock potential. “The city constantly strives to improve,” he says.It means financial institutions such as Invesco and Deka are prepared to invest in Manchester. It has defied many bleak predictions.The bubble in city centre apartments that burst in 2008 brought housing development there to a shuddering halt. But despite predictions that there would be oversupply until 2014, occupancy levels have risen from 60 per cent to 98 per cent in 2011, Mr Hawkins says.Indeed, there could be a lack of Grade A office space because supply has not kept up with demand, says Tony Bray, Manchester head of Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial property services firm.“Manchester faces a shortage of buildings capable of accommodating modern working environments required by the corporate world,” he says.The city centre has become a victim of its own success. The challenge, says Brian Sloan, chief economist of the Manchester chamber of commerce, is to spread the growth to more depressed areas, such as Rochdale, Oldham and Wigan to the north of the city centre.Manchester has a diverse economy propelled by professional services, logistics, retail, leisure and manufacturing. It has a range of big employers, including Bank of New York Mellon, Warburton’s the bakers, and PZ Cussons, the consumer goods group.The biggest sectors of the economy are business and financial services with 16.3 per cent, health at 13.3 per cent, and retail and manufacturing, which represent 10.3 per cent each.There has been some “north-shoring” of jobs, as companies look to cut costs. RBS, the bank, has moved about 300 investment bankers from London.Business costs can be about two-third of those in the south-east and there are 30 shared service centres employing 5,000 people, set up by the likes of Japan Tobacco International and Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer.Alan Edwards, regional head of Barclays Wealth Manchester, says the move from manufacturing to services “feels like a micro model of the changing face of industry in the UK”.Casualties of the recession include London Scottish Bank, the subprime lender, and Halliwells, the law firm, but others have replaced them and business stock rose. Neil Gibson, of Oxford Economics, which provides the Greater Manchester Forecasting Model charting economic performance, says things could have been worse.The city region lost between 30,000 and 35,000 jobs, some 2.5 per cent of the total. The unemployment rate hit 9.2 per cent in the year to June 2011, higher than the 8.2 per cent national average.High streets are suffering, with Stockport and Altrincham having some of the UK’s highest shop vacancy rates. Household income fell 3 per cent last year. Benefit cuts will reduce spending power in the city further.The GM Forecasting Model expects 13,000 jobs losses between 2011 and 2015 in the public sector, which accounts for about a quarter of jobs.Companies also need to increase their level of exports. A recent report by the Commission for the New Economy found that the region sells £7bn of goods and services annually, which is less than the similar sized city regions of Leeds and Birmingham.The region still suffers from a “productivity gap” with other big urban centres because of its low skill levels.Only 64.8 per cent have the Level 2 or higher qualifications generally required even for entry level jobs in a modern economy. As a consequence, 21.6 per cent of households had no individuals aged over 16 in employment in 2010 and one-third of working-age people had no job.But Jonathan Hurst, northern chairman and Manchester office senior partner at KPMG, says the city is adept at finding and retaining talent from outside, especially graduates.Trimega, a company that has pioneered drug testing through hair samples, last year opened a laboratory in north Manchester after a UK-wide search.Douglas Macsween, Trimega’s general manager, UK, says it has found 20 skilled employees, has benefited from good transport links, including the airport, and could soon be expanding in the city.Trafford Park, Europe’s largest industrial estate, remains a motor of growth, employing 35,000 people. Trafford council has convened a group of business leaders to ensure that the estate fulfils its potential. “It is a sleeping giant,” says Matt Colledge, council leader.One option is to take the tram system through it and on to the Trafford Centre, the vast shopping mall that has more than 30m visitors a year.It is short of locally headquartered listed companies, and many start-ups sell out, making it hard to build a critical mass to compete with the south-east.Tim Newns, chief executive of Midas, a development agency owned by a group of local authorities and covering Greater Manchester, says it is working to ensure investors come to the city.Mr Newns cites Gen-probe, a US biotech that bought a local company and decided to establish its European headquarters in the city.Companies based there such as the Co-operative Group and Siemens are also investing. The German company is building a head office for its industrial division, as its current office is home to its renewable energy hub.It is also creating 340 jobs in a centre of excellence for offshore wind turbine grid connections.“We want to see Manchester get its piece of the action in the offshore renewables sector,” says Jürgen Maier, Manchester-based head of the industrial division.The Co-op, a mutual that spans supermarkets, financial and funeral services, would be a FTSE 100 company were it listed.Peter Marks, its chief executive, says it employs 7,000. It looked at building its £100m head office away from the centre but, commercially, it was better to stay put, he says.“Manchester is our spiritual home. It is important that an organisation of our size is at least in the second city if not in the capital. And we’ll never move south.”
316;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-26T05:43:39Z;Quarterly review: Green shoots emerge in bright spots;Net outflows have slowed, while assets under management have actually risen;"Although Europe’s beleaguered fund management industry suffered a second-straight quarter of sharp outflows in the final three months of 2011, there are a few “chinks of light” ahead according to data collated by Lipper FMI, the independent analyst of mutual fund markets. PDF page 1, PDF pages 2 & 3, PDF page 4First, the new outflows, stripping out low-margin money market funds, slowed a little to €63bn, from €92.9bn in the prior three months.Second, an equity market rally meant assets under management actually rose by €111bn to €4.12tn, with the more equity-focused cultures of the UK, Sweden, Switzerland and the “international” category (defined by Lipper as those funds that do not generate four-fifths of their sales from a single market) responsible for more than 100 per cent of the increase.Indeed, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK even managed to chalk up positive flows, alongside such robust hardy perennials as the Czech Republic, Romania and Liechtenstein. In contrast, the more fixed income-focused French and Italian markets suffered net outflows for the sixth-straight quarter.“It has been bad, but there will be a lot of people thinking it could have been worse,” says Ed Moisson, head of UK and cross-border research at Lipper FMI. “There are chinks of light, some markets have been a little bit more solid.”Even the flows data look better when money market funds are factored into the equation; the international segment saw net inflows of €37.7bn into this sector in the fourth quarter. However, despite the stock market recovery, equity funds remain out of favour, clocking up their seventh straight month of net outflows in December, their longest losing streak since Lipper began collecting data 10 years ago.Download complete PDFEurope was the region most out of favour among equity funds and the same was true in the fixed income world, where euro-denominated bond funds suffered net outflows of €4bn, even as bond funds focused on the US markets and the global corporate sector enjoyed strong support.Pimco was strong in the latter category, helping it top the international leaderboard with inflows of €1.18bn in the fourth quarter. Muzinich also topped the €1bn barrier, aided by a popular short- duration, high-yield bond fund. Boston-based Wellington Management came in third, helped by two of its funds – covering European and North American equities – making appearances in the top 10 most popular fund launches in the October-December quarter.With signs emerging of green shoots of recovery in the US, UBS and Hotchkis & Wiley also found an appetite for new North American equity funds.Morgan Stanley’s appearance in the international top 10 was driven by its Global Brands equity fund, which “has done fantastically well this year”, according to Mr Moisson.The Lipper data suggest the UK leaderboard was largely shaped by demand for “absolute return” style vehicles, which benefited BNY Mellon, Standard Life, Troy Asset Management and Ruffer.A Swiss equity fund was the most successful new launch in the fourth quarter, and an optimistic Mr Moisson says: “It has been the case in the past that Swiss-based investors have been among the first to move back into different asset classes when everyone else is still nervous. These guys seem to be in the vanguard of moving back into more risk.”Mr Moisson, says provisional figures suggest Switzerland and the UK enjoyed positive net flows into equity funds in January, while bond fund flows in those two jurisdictions and Luxembourg were also “very healthy”.In contrast to Europe’s outflows, the Asia-Pacific region saw net inflows of $32.9bn in the fourth quarter, the highest figure since the final three months of 2009. However, $26.9bn of this was accounted for by flows into Chinese money market funds.The region mirrored Europe in that investors based in developed countries, such as Australia and Japan, were net disinvestors in 2011. According to Shoko Shinoda, Japan fund analyst at Lipper, Japanese investors are still snapping up exchange traded funds and other passive index products, as well as real estate investment trusts, which tend to pay high monthly dividends.However, equity, balanced and bond funds investing in overseas markets have suffered outflows as the rising yen eats into returns.However, Xav Feng, head of Asia-Pacific research at Lipper, is upbeat about the Chinese fund market, which saw net inflows of $27.8bn during 2011 despite the Shanghai Composite equity index sliding 21.7 per cent.“It’s a positive signal for China’s fund market to regain investors’ attention,” he says.Thailand proved more resilient still, with a fourth straight quarter of positive flows taking its full-year tally to $35.5bn, although once again it was the money market sector leading the way in the final three months of 2011."
317;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-24T00:06:40Z;BofA to stop mortgage sales to Fannie Mae;;Bank of America will no longer sell mortgages to Fannie Mae, the large government-backed loan guarantor, in an escalation of a bitter dispute over compensation for previous bad mortgages.In its annual report, filed on Thursday, BofA said it was cutting off its core business with Fannie in a decision “influenced, in part, by our ongoing differences …in other contexts, including repurchase claims”.Fannie and its sister company Freddie Mac form the foundation of the US mortgage market, buying loans from mortgage originators and securitising them to increase liquidity in the market. Both were seized by the government in 2008 to prevent them failing after the housing market plunged.With mortgage originators having breached underwriting standards on many of the risky loans that were bought by Fannie and Freddie, the organisations have been submitting claims to mortgage originators such as BofA for the loans to be repurchased.Freddie settled with BofA last year but Fannie has cut a more narrow deal with BofA and has been more aggressive in pursuing the bank for what it claims is justified compensation. BofA’s decision to stop dealing with Fannie over new loans is a serious worsening of the dispute.BofA, led by chief executive Brian Moynihan, has shrunk its market share in loan originations, falling behind Wells Fargo, but it still has a significant pipeline of mortgages. It will continue to sell loans to Freddie and will retain others on its balance sheet, said a person familiar with the situation. The private-label market for securitisations dried up after the financial crisis and has not re-emerged, shutting off one avenue for the bank.The bigger problem, which has caused significant angst around BofA over the last two years, is how BofA can cope with the size of the repurchase claims – not just from Fannie but also private investors. BofA has reached a settlement with Bank of New York Mellon over some of private investor claims but it is still awaiting approval by a court and is being challenged by some investors.In the annual report, BofA warned that if it did not win court approval, its future losses related to repurchase claims “could be substantially higher than existing accruals …and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations”.But the decision by one of the biggest mortgage originators in the country to stop supplying new loans to Fannie could potentially create problems for the loan guarantor, which continues to compete with Freddie over mortgages. It also highlights new cracks in the system, which was supposed to be resolved by Congress but a divisive overhaul of the mortgage market has drawn little interest among politicians in an election year.Fannie Mae and BofA declined to comment.
318;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-17T21:30:19Z;Greece hopes and US data boost shares;;"Friday 21.15 GMT. A gauge of global stocks touched a fresh six-month high and Wall Street closed near its best levels since April 2011 as optimism built about the health of the US economy and investors hope confirmation of a Greek bail-out deal is imminent.The FTSE All-World equity index is up 0.7 per cent, having rallied more than 20 per cent since its October low.The S&P is just two points shy of its highest level since April 2011, when it traded at 1,363.61.In the broad market the mood is positive, but risk appetite is not universal. Copper is down 0.4 per cent to $3.78 a pound and growth-focused currencies such as the Australian dollar have pared early gains. Brent crude has fallen 0.4 per cent to $119.69 a barrel.Despite the recent gains in stocks, demand for perceived havens such as US Treasuries and Japanese bonds continues to be high, according to BNY Mellon flows data.In its latest report the bank said that Treasuries and Japanese bonds “have been amongst the strongest net bought fixed income instruments across the board in recent trading sessions”. In contrast, most euro-denominated exposure is out of favour.The dollar index is flat and the 10-year Treasury note yield is up 1 basis point at 2 per cent.The euro consolidated Thursday’s sharp rebound. The single currency had dropped below $1.30 but rose back above $1.31 as traders welcomed reports that agreements on aid and a debt restructuring for Athens were likely to come early next week. It closed in New York up 0.1 per cent at $1.3151.After an initial jump, the S&P 500 in New York pared gains and closed higher at 1361.32, supported of late by a string of upbeat US housing, manufacturing and jobless data, which have raised hopes that a recovery in the world’s biggest economy is gaining traction.“The US continues to be one of the brighter spots in the global economy,” Barclays Capital said in a note. “Greece is less likely to deliver a scare to markets, which already seem to be pricing quite a negative scenario.”Trading was thin during afternoon hours in New York ahead of a US holiday on Monday.European stocks reflected Wall Street’s perky performance and signs of easing stresses in credit markets. The FTSE Eurofirst was up 0.7 per cent, with the banking index rising 1.5 per cent.Hopes for the UK economy are also contributing to the more bullish tone. Retail sales rose unexpectedly in January, delivering a bounce for sterling and pushing 10-year gilt yields up 7bp to 2.19 per cent.Earlier in the session, alongside reaction to better Greek and US economic news, Asian shares were also boosted by well-received corporate earnings and a weaker yen, which lifted Japanese exporters.Additional reporting by Jamie Chisholm in London.……Trading PostFew can deny that short-term market sentiment is currently the hostage of the Greek bail-out farrago, writes Jamie Chisholm.Traders preparing for the weekend need to realise that their positions could be vulnerable from “headline risk” on Monday as eurozone finance ministers meet to discuss aid for Athens. Just to make things a little bit more spicy, some US markets will be shut for Presidents’ Day.Crucially, evidence was emerging during the week that a period of calm in eurozone sovereign debt may be fracturing.Many global risk assets have rallied to multi-month highs during recent weeks, partly in the belief that the ECB’s cheap funding scheme, the LTRO, has helped channel cash into the debt of the likes of Italy and Spain.But after falling below 5.5 per cent eight days ago, Italian 10-year yields hit 5.9 per cent again on Thursday. Granted, they are now 5.58 per cent as Greek deal hopes flare, but the spike speaks to the skittishness.Sovereign bond auctions have been enjoying decent demand. Paris had solid bids for €8.5bn of paper on Thursday; yet French five-year credit default swaps hit 200bp for the first time in a month.The euro takes every Greek disappointment on the chin, but gold in dollar terms has not benefited from the funk. That should continue. The bullion is more bothered about talk of quantitative easing and broad market risk appetite.Watch European banks. They could be fragile after their good run this year."
319;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-15T23:40:28Z;Fed pushes key funding market reform;;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has pledged to push for further reforms of a vital bank funding market, after an industry task force failed to eliminate a key source of systemic risk.The New York Fed is worried that the provision of “intraday credit” in the so-called tri-party repo market creates risk in the wider financial system. It formed an industry task force in 2009 with the hope of eliminating the credit provided by the two clearing banks, JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon.In the $1.7tn tri-party market, banks pledge securities as collateral for short-term loans, more than half of them overnight, from money managers and investors. JPMorgan and BNY Mellon provide the temporary credit to help roll these loans over on a daily basis and replace them with new ones.But the task force charged with eliminating this weakness in the system failed to deliver a meaningful reduction in intraday credit provided by the two clearing banks, the New York Fed said.This sets the stage for intense pressure from the New York Fed on dealers, as well as on JPMorgan and BNY Mellon.After releasing its final report on Wednesday, the task force laid out a timeline that may result in intraday funding being greatly reduced as late as 2016. This follows a previous deadline of August 2011.While the Fed acknowledged reform measures made by the task force over the past two years, it said, ”The amount of intraday credit provided by clearing banks has not yet been meaningfully reduced, and therefore, the systemic risk associated with this market remains unchanged.” It added: “While the task force has been an essential forum for generating and developing ideas, it has not proved to be an effective mechanism for managing individual firms’ implementation of process changes.”The New York Fed said it planned to “intensify its direct oversight of the infrastructure changes that the clearing banks and Fixed Income Clearing Corp are undertaking in order to reduce market reliance on intraday credit”. The FICC deals with the settlement of trades in the repo market.It also said that policymakers were increasing attention on further policy options, which could include developing an industry-financed utility to liquidate securities in an orderly way after dealer defaults and restrictions on the type of securities used as collateral.At the moment, the vast majority of trades use US government or agency debt as security, though a recent Fitch Ratings report indicated that the use of riskier subprime debt as repo collateral was rising.“The Federal Reserve and other regulators will be monitoring the actions of market participants to ensure that timely action is being taken to reduce sources of instability in this market,” the Fed said.Tri-party participants say that intraday credit will not be eliminated until the excessive reliance of banks on overnight funding is significantly reduced. US regulators are believed to be counting on Basel III requirements to help wean banks off overnight funding, effectively forcing reform on to the system.“One of the things you need to bear in mind is [that the New York Fed is] feeling a bit under pressure themselves from the regulatory community,” said a person familiar with the tri-party task force.“The Fed has actually been quite happy with the progress the task force has made,” they added.
320;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-15T19:35:25Z;Look to China for euro value;Beijing seems destined to help set its worth;To say the Greek bail-out has Alice in Wonderland qualities would be unfair to children’s stories. Wednesday’s surreal plot twist was a warning from Greece that – I paraphrase – it is the next Lehman Brothers, too big to be allowed to fail.Investors worried about long-term positions in the euro are trying to understand the impact of a Greek exit on the region, or how far the euro could rally if a deal is done.But perhaps they are looking in the wrong place, indeed the wrong continent. Like so much else, the euro should come with a stamp on the side saying Made in China.This is not to underplay the importance of the Greek outcome. No one really knows if an uncontrolled exit would spark panic in the periphery, or, as German politicians have suggested, be manageable.As long as the euro survives, though, China seems destined to help set its value. There is a tight link between growth in Chinese foreign exchange reserves and moves in the euro against the dollar. Only a small part is explained by the change in value of China’s euros. Instead, suggests Bank of New York Mellon, the explanation is the diversification of China’s dollar-based reserves. When reserves increase, more dollars are swapped into euros, so the euro rises against the dollar.This relationship has held since the euro was created, but tightened in the early 2000s as China’s reserves exploded. Investors able to look beyond the immediate fears for the euro should be considering the outlook for China’s reserves – and so for global rebalancing.Last year’s bout of inflation pushed up China’s real exchange rate against the dollar, while it has steadily raised the nominal rate. That combined with capital flight from emerging markets to see reserves fall in November and December, only the second two-month fall on record.China is publicly committed to rebalance its economy from reserve-boosting exports toward consumption. If it succeeds, the euro is likely to cheapen.
321;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-15T17:57:04Z;Tri-party repo fears unresolved;;The industry task force charged with reforming a key short-term financing market for banks is set to deliver its final recommendations without meeting an important objective of regulators – dramatically reducing the dependence of borrowers on intraday credit.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York set up the task force in 2009 to examine reforms of the so-called “tri-party repo market” amid concerns that the reliance of banks on short-term credit had contributed to the financial crisis.In the $1.7tn tri-party repo market, banks pledge securities as collateral for short-term loans, more than half of them overnight, from money managers and other investors. Two “clearing” banks, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon, facilitate these trades, through such means as providing intraday credit, which helps tide over participants as repo transactions are rolled over or unwound.Regulators fear that the dependence of repo participants on the clearing banks for this interim funding is a source of potential risk for the financial system as a whole. Achieving the “practical elimination” of intraday credit was set as key goal of the task force, which includes representatives from the two clearing banks as well as market participants such as Goldman Sachs.A person familiar with the task force said it would recommend technical steps that could lead to the eventual elimination of intraday credit, leaving the ultimate decision on implementation to BNY Mellon and JPMorgan.But there will be no formal limits on intraday credit, potentially setting up a clash with regulators. The New York Fed has threatened to force change upon the industry if market participants do not voluntarily move to substantially reduce repo risk in a reasonable amount of time.“Progress has been made in reducing intraday credit, but that risk has not been eliminated,” said Peter Nerby, an analyst at Moody’s, the rating agency. “We were under the impression that tri-party repo reforms would include the ‘practical elimination’ of intraday credit.”The person familiar with the task force said the clearing banks were still busy trying to implement previous partial reforms and would need more time to fully respond to the concerns of regulators. “It’s not as if they’ve been standing idle up to now,” this person said. “But [the new proposals] will keep them busy.”Tri-party participants say new rules for banks, including Basel III, could eventually make overnight funding more expensive. That could wean banks off the repo system, reducing the need for intraday credit from clearing banks and effectively forcing reform on to the system.
322;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-12T03:26:44Z;M&G top UK retail brand in 2011;The group gained £4.29bn in new inflows and even saw in increase in the final quarter;M&G was the bestselling UK retail fund brand in 2011 for the third consecutive year, according to the Pridham Report.The asset manager attracted £4.29bn of new money for the year and, unlike most of its rivals, saw an increase in inflows for the last three months of 2011 when investors piled out of equities.Increased flows were due to “a switch by investors back to bond funds”, said Helen Pridham at Fundscape, the research consultancy that compiles the report. “M&G continues to be the default option for investors seeking the safer haven of fixed income”.The group saw inflows of £1.2bn in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the £278m collected by second-placed BlackRock.BlackRock was also second overall for the year, with £1.83bn of net inflows, mainly into its equity funds, both active and passive.Santander Asset Management leapfrogged into the top 10 earning fourth place with net sales of £1.31bn, just behind Standard Life Investments in third. Santander’s inflows were boosted largely by sales of its risk-rated multi-manager funds through branch networks. Others in the top 10 for net sales in 2011 were BNY Mellon, Swip, Axa, Scottish Widows, HSBC and Threadneedle.Although 2012 got off to a good start, Ms Pridham expects a tough year as the 2013 start date for the retail distribution review nears.
323;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-07T22:16:03Z;Regulatory fears weigh on money market managers;;Asset managers sold off Tuesday on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to issuing proposals for the regulation of the US money-market fund industry.Federated Investors, whose $250bn in money market fund assets generate approximately 50 per cent of company profits according to analysts, fell 3.3 per cent to $18.03.Charles Schwab Corp, which manages approximately $160bn in money market fund assets, fell 2.8 per cent to $12.34. Bank of New York Mellon, another large player in the industry, was off 1.2 per cent to $21.69.Money market funds, which invest in highly liquid securities such as US Treasuries, are used by institutional investors to park large amounts of cash not invested elsewhere. But their reputation as safe havens suffered during the financial crisis, when investors in one fund were hit by losses.According to reports, the SEC will propose scrapping the funds’ fixed $1 net asset value and require the funds to set aside capital against losses. Floating net asset values would reduce the funds’ appeal as a cash substitute, while capital charges could eat into already meagre returns.“The proposals as reported could decimate the industry,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, “but if the market thought the proposals would go through unaltered, we’d be seeing bigger share price falls. The expectation is that the SEC has aimed high but will compromise.”Elsewhere, US stocks followed European indices lower in early trading as Greek default worries continued to weigh on sentiment but reversed course after a positive job openings report.US employers ended the year needing to fill 3.38m jobs, 258,000 more than at the end of November.“The total level of unfilled vacancies matches the peak in September and indicates the willingness of private employers to step up the pace of recruiting,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,347.05, within 16 points of its post-2008 high reached last year.UBS equity analysts argued the rally could have further to run, with risk appetite still well short of extreme levels and many investors yet to rotate out of defensive sectors into cyclical names.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,878.2, as shares in Coca Cola rose 0.8 per cent to $68.55 after earnings, and some adjustments, beat analyst expectations.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.1 per cent to 2,904.08, as shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the index, hit an all-time high of $469.43, before paring gains slightly to $468.83, a gain of 1.1 per cent.Coal miners sold off after an Environmental Protection Agency official told Congress the agency’s rules were “underpinning” a transition from coal to gas among US power producers.Alpha Natural Resources fell 5.2 per cent to $22.31, and Peabody Energy was off 3.8 per cent to $37.41.Banks stocks traded slightly lower, with Citigroup falling 0.7 per cent to $33.07, as it faced pressure from a key shareholder to raise its dividend.MasterCard hit an all-time high of $394.48 in the afternoon session, after announcing a doubling of its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share. The shares closed up 0.4 per cent at $392.91.Harman International climbed 3.9 per cent to $46.23, as the audio equipment manufacturer increased profits for a second successive quarter.Yum! Brands rose 2.6 per cent to $64.85, as the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut delivered a 30 per cent growth in profits and said it would open more restaurants abroad in 2012.John Ivankoe at JPMorgan was impressed that earnings growth accelerated in China despite the impact of inflation, while Credit Suisse analysts said the company might be able to increase margins further as commodity price inflation eased.Oil and gas explorer Anadarko Petroleum increased 5.2 per cent to $87.21 despite swinging to a fourth-quarter loss because of charges related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Adjusted earnings and revenue beat expectations.Shares in Leggett & Platt fell 5.9 per cent to $22.00 for the worst performance in the S&P 500, after fourth-quarter earnings declined on restructuring charges and weaker margins. The diversified manufacturer also guided below expectations for 2012 earnings.Groupon shares rallied 2.7 per cent to $24.19 ahead of the company’s first earnings report as a publicly traded company, which is scheduled for after the close of trading on Wednesday. The stock is down 1 per cent for the week, after gaining 22 per cent last week in a Facebook-fuelled social media rally.Despite generally positive numbers on Tuesday, analysts continued to fret about a relatively disappointing earnings season.“Year-over-year earnings per share growth for the index is undershooting expectations, tracking 8.5 per cent versus forecasts of 8.9 per cent,” noted Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo.
324;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-02-03T04:28:23Z;Risky debt use on repo market hits 2008 levels;;The use of lower-rated debt in a key US funding market has returned to pre-crisis levels, fuelling fears that the so-called shadow banking system is becoming riskier.The repo market is an important part of the shadow banking sector, which consists of unregulated financial institutions and activities.In the repo market, banks pledge their securities as collateral for short-term loans from money managers and other investors.The market played a key role in the build-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Banks used toxic assets, such as repackaged subprime loans, to secure trillions of dollars worth of cheap funding.When the US housing bubble burst, the banks’ trading partners refused to accept such securities as collateral and the repo market rapidly contracted.However, a study by Fitch Ratings says the proportion of bundled debt being used as security in repo transactions has returned to pre-crisis levels.Using the repackaged loans can increase risk in the repo market, the rating agency says. This is because the securities may be prone to sudden pullbacks such as the one experienced in 2008.“These are less liquid, longer-tenor assets that are funded short-term by highly risk-averse lenders,” said Robert Grossman, head of macro credit research at Fitch. “In a period of market turbulence, all of the parties to a repo would be affected,” he added, meaning that both banks and funds could be hit.About 20 per cent of the collateral used to secure the transactions now comes from “structured finance”, or repackaged loans, Fitch said in the report.Almost half of the bundled debt is made up of riskier residential mortgages, including subprime.The reason behind the resurgence is difficult to pinpoint, Fitch said. It may reflect a shortage of safer securities or the need to secure funding for an inventory of assets. “It could reflect a thawing of structured finance,” said Mr Grossman. “But it could also be a strategy to increase yield, or a combination of things.”Money market funds, where business models are under pressure from extremely low interest rates, might accept riskier debt as security for their short-term loans because doing so can generate a higher return.According to Fitch, repos backed by structured debt typically yield more than 50 basis points. Those backed by US Treasuries and agency debt might be deemed safer but they yield just 5 bps and 15 bps, respectively.The Fitch study is based on repo data sourced from the 10 biggest money market funds in the US, encompassing about $90bn worth of repo transactions.The actual US repo market is worth $1.6tn, and many of the smaller funds only accept government-guaranteed securities, such as Treasuries, in exchange for their loans.The Federal Reserve has set up a special task force to work on a plan to scale back systemic risk in the repo market and reduce its dependence on JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon, the biggest clearing banks in the US triparty repo system.Still, others disagree that the use of structured finance in the US repo market will automatically increase risk.“The underlying performance of many of these deals has been excellent and shown great stability through the crisis,” said Mark Hale, chief investment officer of Prytania Investment Advisors. “If the improvement in confidence spreads further, then the use of structured finance could become a self-reinforcing, positive force easing pressures on the financial system and the underlying consumer and corporate credit conditions.”
325;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;US jobless claims trend lower;;US jobless claims extended their downward trend last week, falling by 12,000 to 367,000, in a further signal of a strengthening labour market recovery.The labour department’s report on first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending January 28 was better than the 371,000 forecast and moved the four-week moving average down 2,000 to 375,750. The previous week’s reading was revised slightly higher to 379,000.Analysts were upbeat about the data before Friday’s government report on unemployment and job creation in January.“This is certainly a positive in front of non-farm payrolls and further supports the view that the US economy is creating more jobs with the prospect for a lower unemployment rate. Perhaps we can break below 8 per cent by year end,” said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon.The median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg for Friday’s report calls for net job growth of 145,000 last month, compared with 200,000 in December, and for the unemployment rate to hold at a near three-year low of 8.5 per cent.Another report released on Thursday suggested the labour market recovery may remain volatile, however. US companies announced plans to cut 53,486 jobs from payrolls, the most in a month since September, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the staffing company. That was 39 per cent higher than planned redundancies in January 2011 and 28 per cent above December’s total.“It is not unusual to see a job-cut surge to start the year,” the report said, noting that January typically brings the highest level of redundancies.Retailers and financial companies led cuts over the month, while government redundancies continued to be “relatively low” at 3,021.Also on Thursday, the labour department said productivity in the business sector slowed to 0.7 per cent growth in the fourth quarter compared with 1.9 per cent in the third quarter, suggesting that companies may need to increase hiring in the future to maintain efficiency.“We are at the point in the cycle where squeezing any more output from the existing labour force, with the current capital stock, becomes more difficult,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank. “The good news is that we are closer to the point where a virtuous cycle of increased demand, driving increased employment and income, generating more demand, is in place.”

The business is majority-owned by Nasdaq but operates independently of the bourse.Nasdaq has held talks with a consortium of banks to discuss a deal that would enable the bourse to withdraw some of the $75m of capital it is using to back the clearing house.“We’re engaged in active dialogue for a proper home over the long term,” said Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.IDCG is one of several clearing houses that has emerged since the financial crisis to clear over-the-counter trades in interest-rate swaps and other derivatives between big-bank dealers and their customers.The space has been evolving slowly as the final rules on clearing are completed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other regulators. IDCG, like rivals launched by CME Group and LCH.Clearnet, has seen only test trading thus far.But one thing that is becoming clear is that smaller broker-dealers and pension funds and asset management groups, known as the buyside, are for the most part not becoming direct members of clearing houses, as had initially been envisioned.Instead, buyside firms are clearing via brokerages known as futures clearing merchants, or FCMs, which are mostly attached to large banks such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan.By bringing in banks as partners, IDCG may be opting to follow a similar model. The group declined to comment on its plans. The minority investments in IDCG are from Bank of New York Mellon and other firms.Last year, IDCG was sued by Jefferies, the US investment bank and owner of a mid-tier FCM. Jefferies accused it of mispricing swaps transactions it was converting into futures positions. The two groups agreed to resolve the suit via arbitration earlier this month.
327;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Europe could learn from US debt scramble;Default ‘dry run’ offers valuable lessons;"Last summer, some of America’s largest banks secretly stocked their cash machines with the maximum possible supply of notes. The reason? In July 2011, the bankers feared that the US might be about to suffer a technical default, because Congress could not agree on measures to raise the debt ceiling.So, they decided – after collective discussions – to keep those ATMs stuffed with greenbacks to ensure that consumers would never panic about running out of cash if that “worst-case” default scenario transpired. It is a sobering – and illuminating – point to ponder, amid the tortuous dramas now surrounding the future of the eurozone. In public no senior European or American banker currently wants to admit they are preparing for another “worst-case” scenario, namely the break-up of the eurozone, or exit of one member (such as Greece).After all, at this week’s meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, eurozone leaders have stressed their profound commitment to keeping the single currency intact. And the consensus among the senior bankers I have spoken to this week is that the most likely scenario for the eurozone for the foreseeable future – say, with a 70 per cent probability – is continued “muddle through”; the ECB’s liquidity moves have staved off fears of an imminent crisis.Nevertheless, almost nobody seems to expect a truly positive “solution” soon, and most think that a break-up or exit scenario remains entirely possible (say, with a 20-25 per cent probability). Thus, even amid their soothing public rhetoric, most large banks are now secretly preparing contingency plans – just in case.In some ways, this echoes what secretly occurred in America last year. In the first half of 2011, large banks such as JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon are thought to have each spent about $50m ensuring that their contracts were legally watertight in the event of a US default, and that repo deals and financial markets were continuing to function (along with those ATMs.) This time, some large banks may be spending far more, since the task is dramatically more complex: they have to review the fine print of all legal contracts for any euro exit, and to ensure that financial market transactions are watertight, or at least hedged. Many large banks are also trying to make sure that their liabilities in peripheral countries are matched with assets inside the same country – rather than across the eurozone as a whole.However, there is one crucial distinction with last year’s “dry run” – and it is not reassuring. Back in the summer of 2011, when US default loomed, the senior managers in the largest banks spoke extensively with each other about their preparations. They then communicated these collaborative moves in extensive detail to the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other regulators.For its part, the government never offered active feedback, far less direct leadership in these preparations; after all, it would have been politically suicidal if news had leaked that the Treasury was preparing for a default. Nevertheless, the sheer fact that this dialogue was under way was profoundly reassuring for many market players; a plan was there.In Europe today, however, it appears that there is little – or no – similarly collaborative move. Or if there is, it is so utterly secret that not even senior bankers know about it yet. On an individual level, most large banks insist they are well prepared (though many express concern that the exchanges or settlement systems seem less organised). But nobody appears to have spoken extensively to anyone else, far less to any central government group.Why? One problem is that the banking landscape in Europe is far more fragmented than in America. Another is weak European banks are now too distracted, or cash-poor, to prepare for a vague risk. There is also a deep reluctance among some eurozone bankers to admit they are preparing for a worst case, which would risk undercutting their own politicians. And some bankers argue that if a truly serious crisis materialised (such as the exit of Italy, say) it would be so devastating and complex that planning would be pointless.But, to my mind, this leaves Europe missing a big trick; precisely because there was that “dry run” last summer, there are very useful lessons to learn, and preparing for the worst does not necessarily make it happen. Europe’s leaders would do well to study that “dry run” – and then pray that the worst case does not materialise; any more than it did in the US last year."
328;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-01-25T23:44:29Z;Creditors’ lawyers seek their dues in Kodak bankruptcy;;One thing is going smoothly for Eastman Kodak. This afternoon, in the basement of a Wall Street hotel, it took just three hours to decide who should make up the committee to represent creditors in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.Representatives of the US Trustee, the bankruptcy-monitoring part of the Department of Justice, huddled for a while with individual creditors and the lawyers looking to represent them, but the composition they agreed upon is no great surprise.The seven-name committee includes the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that insures US defined pension benefits, and KPP Trustees, which represents Kodak’s UK pension plan, the largest creditor with an as yet undetermined claim.The UK pensioners, affected (despite the fact that Kodak’s foreign subsidiaries form no part of the bankruptcy) because they had a guarantee from the US company, could play a central role and may yet end up with some stake in any company that emerges.Other creditors include Sony Pictures Entertainment, the biggest of Kodak’s Hollywood creditors with a $16.7m claim, and Walmart, the largest retail creditor with an $11.4m claim. Primax Electronics, Strategic Procurement Group and US Bank National Association made the list but the Bank of New York Mellon, trustee for more than $650m of Kodak unsecured notes and the second largest creditor, did not.A spokesperson for Kodak put out a bland statement, saying it looked forward to working with the committee. “We are committed to working as quickly and efficiently as possible with our stakeholders to reorganise Kodak so that it can emerge from the Chapter 11 process as a vibrant enterprise that will deliver profitable and sustainable growth for its stakeholders,” it added.Today’s “formation meeting” shed little more light on the process – the only question from the room was greeted with the response that the company and the trustee would not engage in a detailed Q&A, especially not on valuations. Kodak’s CFO, Ann McCorvey, represented the company and gave a brief overview of its plan to focus on its most promising businesses and “fairly resolve legacy liabilities”, but more detail is unlikely before a February 15 “omnibus hearing”.But one thing was clear as about 200 lawyers packed the room and organisers said they had received many more ballots from would-be creditor advisors than expected: the bankruptcy lawyers see many billable hours of work ahead.
329;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-01-21T02:24:11Z;Vision of buyside clearing fails to become reality;Many clients of the banks are still not ready for the ’big bang’ of central clearing;Even in the world of complex derivatives, it is worth remembering a hoary old business tenet: the customer comes first.Many arcane debates have raged around the core Dodd-Frank financial reform act principle that more derivatives trades should be centrally cleared, including whether smaller dealers should be allowed to participate in clearing.Yet it is easy to forget that dealers have already been centrally clearing trades among themselves for a few years.The same cannot be said for trades between banks and their clients, even as the final clearing rules near, with the beginning of the implementation phase expected later this year.Though in recent months CME Group and LCH.Clearnet have cleared a number of such trades, market participants say the landscape is still evolving, and many clients of the banks are still not ready for the “big bang”.Despite the law’s requirement of “fair and open access” to clearing, the initial vision of having asset managers, hedge funds and other institutions that trade risks related to commodity prices or interest rates with banks become direct clearing members has not come to fruition.Instead, buyside firms have chosen to operate through futures clearing merchants, or FCMs, as the law also allows. BlackRock’s recent trades cleared on LCH.Clearnet’s SwapClear platform, for example, were via Goldman Sachs as FCM.The primary barrier, aside from the costs of new systems and the expense of contributing to clearing houses’ central funds, is that clearing houses typically ask that members step in to trades in the event of a default – a prospect now much more real after MF Global’s collapse. That requires the member to have a trading desk and agree to take that principal risk, which many institutions do not want to do.“If we were to take the current clearing house and regulatory requirements that exist today, for large asset managers that act as a fiduciary, direct membership doesn’t work,” says Supurna VedBrat, co-head of BlackRock’s market structure and electronic trading team.Clearing houses acknowledge this challenge. “We are talking to some on the buyside about whether they want to be members themselves,” says Michael Davie, chief executive of LCH’s SwapClear. “But I think that most will avail themselves of clearing services rather than provide them.”But that does not mean the buyside is leaving these choices up to dealers. As more standardised swaps begin to trade in electronic, transparent markets, with trades reported to a central marketplace, known as a swap execution facility, they are likely to rely far less on dealers.“Discussions among the buyside have been around how can we respond to regulation, and how can we derive business benefit,” says Ebbe Kjaersbo, chief business consultant at SimCorp, which provides back office services for fund managers.On cue, new firms are popping up to serve more agile fund managers. The custodian banks BNY Mellon and State Street, for example, have launched FCMs.“The traditional buyside/sellside dichotomy is breaking down,” says Charley Cooper, senior managing director at State Street Global Markets. “In the old days, you would clear with whom you were doing the trade with. Those things are now unbundling.”Clearing houses are also competing to have buyside clients direct their FCMs to send trades to one house or another with more streamlined processes for posting margin or expanded ranges of acceptable collateral.“It may be that when buyside clients clear through CME, it is a lot more capital efficient than another clearing house,” says Laurent Paulhac, managing director of OTC services at CME Group.Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive at BNY Mellon Clearing, also cites concern about margin and collateral as an advantage that custodian banks may have over the incumbent dealers.“The main demand to start this business came from the client side,” he says. “These clients have assets with us already, and clearing is a natural extension, with efficiencies therein to help mobilise their collateral.”But there may be limits to how creative the buyside wants to be in chasing opportunities to take out costs and trade agressively.“I cannot emphasise how important it is that clients are comfortable that collateral is protected,” says Ms VedBrat of BlackRock. Or as Mr Paulhac puts it: “The buyside is not seeking to compete. Their aim is to reduce risk.”
330;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-01-19T00:56:44Z;US custodian banks hit by shift into cash;;Global custodian banks have adopted a defensive position as fund managers and large institutions shift into cash and ultra-safe assets, putting pressure on the banks’ ability to generate income.Bank of New York Mellon earnings in the fourth quarter dropped from $679m last year to $505m. The quarter’s results included a $107m restructuring charge, primarily a result of lay-offs.“As the year-end approached last year, [we saw a] complete risk-off mode: a decline in volumes, movement to cash,” said Gerald Hassell, chief executive. That “doesn’t allow for fee activity either in investment services or investment management area”.Low interest rates have put tremendous pressure on custodian banks that manage funds for large institutions and retail brokerages, with the Federal Reserve’s commitment to near-zero rates through 2013 make it difficult to invest customer funds in safe investments that generate return.Coming at the same time that fees generated by trading and investment activity are falling sharply, such groups have been forced to rely on cost-cutting and lay-offs to generate consistent earnings growth.Northern Trust profits dropped 17 per cent for the fourth quarter to $130m, down from $157m in the same period in 2010 and also hit by restructuring charges of $61m.State Street’s quarterly net income jumped from $81m to $383m, though the favourable comparison was due to a large charge taken in the fourth quarter of last year.Shares of BNY Mellon were down 4.4 per cent by mid-afternoon, at $20.33, giving up all of its gains so far for the year. State Street dropped 6.8 per cent to $39.84, and Northern Trust was down 2.2 per cent to $41.02.The firms reported a doubling in waivers on fees charged on money-market funds that offer low returns but promise immediate liquidity, with some $90m in fees waived this year. Low rates have forced the banks to forgo fees that would push money-market funds into the negative.“Money market fund managers, including our own, have been particularly conservative. They shortened durations and reduced European exposure, which resulted in lower yields and even higher money market feed fund waivers,” Mr Hassell said.As of January 11, US money market mutual fund assets totalled $2.7tn, according to the Investment Company Institute. That is up from $2.64tn at the end of the third quarter, but down from the $2.8tn held in such funds a year ago. Industry assets peaked in January 2009 at $3.92tn.The groups are responding with aggressive cost-cutting. Northern Trust is cutting 700 jobs. State Street said it would likely continue to cut staff, having closed a fixed-income trading unit in the fourth quarter.“The most recent market action looks good, but we still worry about Europe, and we’re trying to be realistic and …straightforward in our disclosure that we keep trying to adjust the expense base to generate earnings,” said Jay Hooley, State Street chief executive.
331;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-01-15T04:00:21Z;Call for inquiry after losses at Arch Cru;MPs are taking a close look at complex structures;Industry figures and members of parliament are calling for a crackdown on complex fund structures, as details emerge of how investors lost money in an operation involving offshore vehicles.An all-party group of 60 UK MPs is pushing for a government inquiry into losses registered by a family of funds managed by Arch Financial Products, which is being sued for £150m ($190m) for allegedly breaching its mandate and its duty to exercise fundamental care of assets, as well as a failure to account for “substantial secret profits”.Arch is being sued in relation to a series of UK-domiciled investment funds, branded Arch Cru, which raised around £422m from 10,000 retail investors. At least one was classed as “cautious managed”.The money was invested in a series of “cells” listed on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange managed by Arch, which were suspended in 2009. These in turn invested in assets ranging from ships and wine to student accommodation and an adhesive tape manufacturer.Many of the investments ultimately lost money and investors are facing losses of 30 per cent or more, even after Capita, the authorised corporate director of the UK funds, together with HSBC and BNY Mellon, the depositaries, created a £54m hardship fund.This structure has been criticised for reducing transparency and allowing the UK funds to, perfectly legally, flout restrictions on their holdings. The funds were allowed to have exposure of only 20 per cent to unlisted assets, a restriction they more than met by investing solely in the listed Guernsey cells, yet the ultimate underlying assets of the funds were all unlisted.Tom Greatrex, co-chair of the parliamentary group, said an inquiry was essential to “understand how this has happened and what measures should be in place to stop it happening again”.He added: “The Financial Services Authority had a regulatory responsibility. They were supposedly monitoring and providing reassurance as to what Arch Cru were up to but it wasn’t until suspension that they became aware of the labyrinthine structure.“Nothing has changed. The structure of Arch Cru, the role of the Guernsey stock exchange, is obviously where there is a lot of concern.”Alan Hughes, a solicitor at Foot Anstey who is leading efforts to win more compensation for investors, said nothing had been done to stop a repeat episode. “We would assume the FSA would think there is a bit of a cock-up here. They need to look at how they can stop this happening again, how they can supervise [funds] better in the future.”But one industry figure said the compensation stumped up by Capita and the custodians had concentrated minds.“This has caused an absolute wave in the industry of people saying: ‘Oh heck’. I would hope across the industry there is an awful lot of reviewing of how things are done,” he said.“This is going to be the first time people look right the way through structures. If your fund is in the UK but your investing fund is Caymans, or British Virgin Islands or Channel Islands or wherever it may be, you have to look through and exercise governance on the real assets.”The FSA, which is investigating IFAs that sold Arch Cru funds, said the Financial Conduct Authority, one of its successor organisations due to be created next year, would be likely to intervene in problems much earlier, “ideally before we start to see large scale detriment to consumers”.
332;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-01-15T03:53:48Z;Investors’ losses reveal darker tone of Arch Cru affair;A High Court writ alleges ‘secret profits’ and poor investments;At one level, the Arch Cru affair is a colourful tale of decrepit oil tankers, alleged “secret profits” and a senior figure who believed God would smooth over any resultant problems, but now runs a fish and chip shop.Yet with around 10,000 small investors, many of whom poured a substantial slice of their life savings into the Arch Cru funds, being left out of pocket, the affair takes on a far darker tone.The range of Arch Cru funds was launched in 2006 by Arch Financial Products, headed by Robin Farrell, previously global head of alternative investments at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, and Cru Investment Management, which would market the funds to independent financial advisers.One fund, the Arch Cru Investment Portfolio, was placed in the “cautious managed” category of the UK Investment Management Association’s classification system, although the IMA apparently later told Citywire, a news service, that the word “cautious” should “not be taken literally”.The funds are believed to have raised around £422m ($646m) via 900 IFAs. This money was then invested in a series of 24 “cells” listed on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange, designed to invest in asset classes such as private equity, private finance, real estate and “sustainable” opportunities. With a handful of institutions investing directly, the total assets of the cells were believed to be around £500m.The published performance figures for the Arch Cru funds were so good that two of them topped their IMA sectors in 2008.Jon Maguire, the chief executive of Cru and son of a Baptist minister, who had by then started a fresh investment venture in Malawi, reportedly told staff in December 2008: “God told me two years ago that if I would look after Africa he would look after Cru.”Yet the Almighty appeared to let him down in March 2009 when the entire Arch Cru range was suspended due to a lack of liquidity to deal with redemptions, a problem Arch blamed on “extreme market conditions”. The suspension was never lifted.Capita, the authorised corporate director of the UK funds, appointed a fresh investment manager to the Guernsey cells, Spearpoint, and a new board, headed by Hugh Aldous, chairman of Capita Sinclair Henderson, a Capita subsidiary, to recover as much value as possible for the investors.A High Court writ lodged last week by the board claims Arch breached its mandate and its duty to exercise fundamental care of assets, as well as failing to account for “substantial secret profits”. It is suing Arch for £150m.According to the writ, Arch invested $167m to finance the conversion of “seven old ships of very poor quality”. The oil tankers, which were to be converted into double-hulled vessels, increasing their value, were owned by Salamis Shipyards, a Greek company, which was to carry out the work.The writ alleges that a bankruptcy petition was outstanding against Salamis at the time of the investment, that it had not filed its accounts since 2002 and that Nicolas Koros, the owner, had previously been involved in at least three major shipping ventures that had failed, leaving banks and other investors with “huge losses”.The investment resulted in losses of $162m, according to the writ, while Arch made “secret profits” of £1.7m, the writ alleges.Arch is also accused of making “secret profits” of £3m from a £26m investment in Lonscale, a “heavily indebted and loss-making” property company, which resulted in losses of more than £20m.A further £5m is alleged to have been lost via an investment in the shares of Arch UK and a swap transaction based on the value of the shares. Arch “increased the valuations attributed to some of the investments without justification,” the writ states.Some £2m was invested in Cru, giving the company a valuation of £9m, although the most recent audited accounts disclosed net assets of only £8,413, according to the writ. The shares were later written down to zero.Mr Farrell says Arch and its principals “vigorously deny these unfounded allegations in their entirety”. Arch says it “deeply regrets any losses to investors” but blames them on Capita, for its alleged “interference in management” prior to the suspension, the Financial Services Authority, for its “poorly considered intervention”, and the global financial crisis.It also alleges there is a “significant conflict” in Mr Aldous chairing the board of the cells, given Capita’s role with the UK funds.Capita, which together with HSBC and BNY Mellon, the depositaries to the UK funds, has offered £54m to help recompense investors, said it rejected the “illogical suggestion” that the suspension of the UK funds was the cause of a fall in the value of the Guernsey cells.
333;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
334;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2012-01-11T00:22:17Z;BNY Mellon in talks to settle overcharging suit;;Bank of New York Mellon is in settlement talks with US authorities to resolve a civil lawsuit alleging it overcharged customers on currency transactions for more than a decade.If a settlement is reached with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan, which filed the lawsuit in October, it would resolve one formidable legal threat against the bank and potentially provide a framework to resolve other lawsuits.BNY Mellon, a large US custodian bank, was also sued by state attorneys-general from New York, Florida and Virginia, alleging the bank overcharged its clients, including pension funds, other banks and investors. The New York lawsuit is seeking to recover more than $2bn in allegedly ill-gotten gains.The lawsuits allege that the bank purchased and sold foreign currencies at the worst rate at which the currency traded on the day of the trade, as opposed to the market price at the time of the trade. The suits claim that the bank pocketed the difference.The negotiations with federal officials were disclosed in a letter filed by prosecutors seeking a one-week extension to continue negotiations. “The parties have been engaged in discussions aimed at resolving claims the government has asserted in this action, and the parties are presently close to reaching an agreement that would resolve certain claims,” according to a letter by the US attorney’s office in Manhattan. The request, which was granted, said it was the second extension sought in the matter.The potential settlement relates only to non-monetary aspects of the case, such as changes to disclose practices and pricing policies, according to a person familiar with the situation.In a December 1 letter, attorneys for BNY Mellon stated that the discussions, if successful, would resolve “some or all” of the government’s allegations.Representatives for BNY Mellon and the US attorney’s office declined to comment. A spokesman for the New York attorney-general declined to comment on its lawsuit.The lawsuits allege the bank told pension funds and other clients it would execute trades at the “best rate of the day”. The bank allegedly failed to comply with that promise and hid how it priced various transactions, the suits say.This practice allegedly generated “enormous” profits for the bank at the expense of its clients during the 2008 financial crisis, when currency prices fluctuated dramatically, the US lawsuit alleged.Prosecutors said one trade involved the Taiwan dollar. In its lawsuit, prosecutors alleged that a BNY Mellon trader recognised the manipulation, sought guidance from management and was “explicitly told to use the artificial range of the day”.
335;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-12-28T19:21:10Z;Fed seeks to curb repo market risk;;An industry task force sponsored by the US Federal Reserve is working on a plan to scale back systemic risk in the funding market at the centre of the financial crisis and to reduce trader dependence on JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon.The changes would be aimed at bringing greater automation to the $1.6tn tri-party repurchase, or repo, market but could increase financing costs for other banks.In the repo market, banks pledge securities as collateral for short-term loans from money managers and other investors.While the issue is technical, it raises questions both about the ongoing vulnerability of the two so-called clearing banks in the market, JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, and their power over the Wall Street community in general.Many officials at the Fed believe that such a role may not be appropriate for private institutions and that a public sector body may be more appropriate.“The incentives are different for a private sector institution when under pressure,” said one senior Fed official. “There are conflicting objectives and when stresses rise, the banks may behave badly. The desire for security or collateral can be debilitating.”The task force – made up of leading banks, including JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, and investors – met earlier this month to discuss additional reforms to prevent a repeat of the turmoil that characterised the repo market in 2008.A final report by the task force is expected to be published early next year.Its focus is the reduction of the role of the two clearing banks, which extend temporary credit late in the day to Wall Street dealers when repo trades are unwound and reconstituted.Policymakers worry that market volatility could increase significantly if a repo-market borrower ran into funding problems and were unable to obtain credit from either clearing bank.That would raise the spectre of repo securities being liquidated en masse, potentially harming other investors.The regulators are pushing for a real-time settlement process for new and maturing repos, which would alleviate the need for intraday credit from JPMorgan and BNY Mellon.With the Fed pushing for fundamental reform, creating a real-time system is a potentially costly and difficult technology project, said bankers.It will also result in higher charges for dealers using repo as a financing tool.The industry had hoped to shift 90 per cent of intraday credit from the two clearing banks by August using existing systems, but the deadline was missed as the industry belatedly realised the huge scale of the undertaking.“A road map to real-time auto confirmation would be a huge step, but achieving that is problematic as there are differences in the operational capacities of dealers and cash investors,” said Peter Nerby, senior vice-president at Moody’s.Any delay in resolving the issue of intraday credit potentially runs into the heavy hand of regulators who want this potential source of systemic risk eliminated and are waiting for results.“Experience suggests that it is not easy for market participants to agree on measures that enhance financial stability when this goal conflicts with commercial and business interests,” said William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, earlier this year. “If the private sector falls short in this instance, public authorities may need to intervene and impose more forceful regulatory solutions.”The most likely outcome, should the tri-party market fail to satisfy regulators, might take the form of a centralised clearing house, which would oversee the lending process without the pressure of making profits.“Reducing the vulnerability of the tri-party system entails either increasing the number of clearing banks beyond BNY Mellon and JPMorgan or replacing them with a centralised counterparty that is a utility and thus has fewer conflicting incentives than a clearing bank,” said Anshuman Jaswal, senior analyst at Celent.
336;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-12-16T22:57:13Z;Penson closes UK offices;Futures broker could not find buyer;Penson Worldwide, the US futures brokerage and clearing firm, has opted to shutter its UK unit after failing to find a buyer, as it continues to restructure its struggling business.In late November, Penson announced it had sold its Australian unit for $32m to BNY Mellon’s Pershing unit, the first of a series of anticipated divestments to raise cash and shore up Penson’s core US operations.However, it was unable to find a taker for money-losing Penson Financial Services of London, which saw annual losses of $6m-$7m, according to the company.On Friday, Penson said it plans to close the unit and sell off certain assets. “Exiting the UK local clearing market was one of the company’s previously announced strategic objectives to reduce costs and debt, and improve profitability,” it said.Penson “regretted closing PFSL, but that after lengthy negotiations with several leading financial organisations, it was unlikely a sale agreement of PFSL as an operating entity would have been reached in a timely manner”, it said.The firm handles trades on behalf of retail and high-frequency proprietary groups. Like other brokerages, it has been hit in recent months by fears of declining revenues as it struggled to generate returns on deposits due to falling interest rates and a drop in client activity.Despite the collapse of competitor MF Globa l, which also had a large UK operation, Penson has continued to struggle. Its share price fell 3.5 per cent on Friday to $1.10. The shares were as high as $10 last year.“Number one on Penson’s recently announced strategic initiatives was a sale of the firm’s UK subsidiary, a goal that ultimately proved impossible,” said Patrick O’Shaugnessy, analyst at Raymond James. He estimated the cost of closing the PFSL at around $5m.“We suspect that Penson is not done reducing its debt balances, and as the firm was unable to sell its UK subsidiary, we believe a sale of its Canadian subsidiary is now more likely,” Mr O’Shaugnessy added.
337;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;US consumer prices flat in November;;Lower petrol costs kept US consumer prices flat in November, but core prices tracked their biggest annual rise in more than three years, suggesting that commodity price spikes seen earlier this year continue to affect consumers.The consumer price index was unchanged last month following a 0.1 per cent decline in October, which was the first time the cost of living had dropped since June. Economists polled by Bloomberg had forecast prices would rise 0.1 per cent. Prices were 3.4 per cent higher than in November 2010, the smallest annual rise in seven months.But the moderation in headline inflation was due to a sharp fall in petrol prices as well as cheaper household energy, which offset rising costs of food, clothing, rents and medical care, the labour department said.Excluding food and fuel costs, core prices rose 0.2 per cent, ahead of the 0.1 per cent economists had expected and faster than October’s 0.1 per cent gain. From a year ago, core prices rose 2.2 per cent, the most since October 2008.“This decline is not sustainable,” said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. “Oil prices are back around $100 a barrel now, so it suggests we’re likely to see a rebound. More troubling is the persistent rise in core inflation, which surprised to the upside. We’ve been ignoring headline inflation because of the volatility of food and energy prices, but if they remain high, they will drag core higher.”Core prices are the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, and it has set its long-term target at 1.7 to 2 per cent. The central bank has stated throughout this year that rising commodity prices are “transitory”. In its most recent policy statement this week, the Fed said: “Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.”Prices for shelter ticked up 0.2 per cent, with rents also up 0.2 per cent. Medical care costs gained 0.5 per cent, and apparel was 0.6 per cent more expensive.But those increases were outweighed by a second straight month of falling energy prices. The overall energy index was down 1.6 per cent, led by a 2.4 per cent drop in petrol. Lower natural gas prices left household energy costs 0.4 per cent lower.But some commodities were more expensive, pushing food prices up 0.1 per cent for a second month. Consumers paid more for cereal and bakery products and nonalcoholic beverages, while costs of fruits and vegetables, dairy, meat, poultry, eggs and fish all declined.
338;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-12-02T00:02:40Z;Philanthropy: Banking benefactors;Though banks’ charitable arms are often partly set up for what is called ‘reputational benefits’, the large sums they grant have a significant effect;Bank of New York Mellon gives poor people coats, Lloyds Banking Group helps former convicts get bank accounts, Credit ­Suisse encourages leadership in teenagers through martial arts and JPMorgan Chase sends food baskets to Brazil.Though banks’ charitable arms are often partly set up for what the UK Charities Aid Foundation calls “reputational benefits”, they are ­involved in a huge range of philanthropic activities, and the large sums they grant have a significant effect.In 2010, JP Morgan Chase donated a total of $150m to many causes, while Lloyds Banking Group’s four foundations granted a total of £76m ($121m). While these foundations’ objectives are broadly the same – improving conditions in communities where they have a presence – their focus is markedly different from region to region.Common funding priorities are uncontroversial-but-worthy causes, such as education. While European bank foundations frequently focus on micro­finance and employees’ charitable efforts, US banks often involve themselves with basic-needs provision such as education, areas Europeans usually expect to be covered by the state.Celina Miranda, charitable giving manager at BNY Mellon, describes her bank’s philanthropy as filling “those gaps that are left by public support …such activities as foreclosure prevention and providing shelter and temporary living space for families with emergency needs, and we work with food assistance programmes”.Education, BNY Mellon’s other main funding area, is also an important cause for JPMorgan Chase’s foundation, whose aims seem broadly similar. A key aspect of the bank’s philanthropic work is in disadvantaged communities, where they take an individualistic approach in developing the skills of teachers, principles and leaders.Kimberly Davis, JPMorgan Foundation president, says: “Strong role models and community leaders can have a major impact – and we look for partners who can step outside of the box to help create systemic change.”Already successful in deprived areas of the US, the JPMorgan Foundation has introduced this model in London, in a scheme that subsidises arts access for schools in low-income areas.International projects like these notwithstanding, both JPMorgan’s and BNY Mellon’s charitable donations overwhelmingly stay within the US.By contrast, the relative wealth of Credit Suisse’s home country tends to focus much of the bank’s giving outside its borders, though it invested SFr30m ($33m) in 2010 to help train Switzerland’s unemployed youth.The bank says that roughly 80 per cent of its charitable budget goes to emerging markets. The manner in which it organises its philanthropy is peculiarly Swiss, with a set of strong regional foundations substantially independent from a loosely controlling centre.As Hanspeter Kurzmeyer, the bank’s head of corporate citizenship, explains: “We give guidelines – for example that at least 20 per cent of funding should go to education. But our foundations within that region make a business plan according to those guidelines, and then they decide exactly where those funds should be allocated – not us.”This hands-off approach to decision making may in part lie behind the sheer variety of activities with which Credit Suisse is involved. With a broad emphasis on microfinance, these range from introducing Hong Kong children to rugby, to funding a Johannesburg academy developing leadership in young people.Community projects like these are likewise a big focus for British banks’ foundations. While it has the funds for broad-brushstroke, Victorian-style philanthropy, Lloyds Banking Group’s four foundations generally avoid large organisations, rarely giving grants ­exceeding £50,000 annually. Youth clubs and victim support groups are common recipients, while its work with former offenders shows an ­unusual willingness to grapple with the less obviously photogenic side of charity.Coutts’ Charitable Trust, meanwhile, restricts itself mostly to sums no higher than £500, though it also has a foundation that gives a few larger grants. “We choose to support smaller charities where the sums we offer can make a difference,” says Mark Bevan, a trustee.While such grants are invaluable to their recipients, the foundations emphasised how little they could do without assistance from governments and other donors.And the pool of money is shrinking. Lehman Brothers’ foundation was a big player in the charity sector and its absence is being keenly felt.Lloyds Banking Group, among others, now gives its foundations money by grant rather than as a percentage of profits. While these pillars of their communities are hardly at risk of falling, they are more cautious with their charitable donations than they once were.
339;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Penson sells its Australian operations;Brokerage and clearing group shores up US business;Penson Worldwide, the US brokerage and clearing group, sold its Australian operations on Monday as part of a restructuring to shore up its core US business.The firm, which handles trades on behalf of retail and high-frequency proprietary groups, has been hit by fears of declining revenues as it struggles to generate returns on deposits due to falling interest rates and a drop in client activity.Despite the collapse of competitor MF Global that could lead to picking up new clients, Penson remains out of favour with investors. It has seen its share price tumble to less than $1 last week from as high as $10 last year. The shares closed at $1.20 on Monday.Penson, based in Dallas, Texas, agreed to sell Penson Financial Services Australia to BNY Mellon’s Pershing unit for $32m, the first in an anticipated series of sales of overseas units. Penson said it would realise a $14m gain from the sale.PFSA, which has 76 correspondents, is a trading participant in Chi-X Australia and is a clearing and settlement participant on the Australian Stock Exchange.As part of its restructuring plan, Penson is also looking to sell its UK operation, Penson Financial Services, which has lost money. It has considered a sale of its Canadian business as well.Many market participants have speculated that Penson itself could be for sale, but the company has not confirmed any active discussions.Analysts warned that Penson might still struggle to regain profitability, even as it pays down debts and shores up capital with the proceeds from asset sales.“While Penson continues to make progress on several of its strategic initiatives, the full impact won’t be felt until early to mid-2012 and, in our view, the path to profitability remains an uphill battle,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, in a note to clients.Penson saw its trading-based revenues fall 7 per cent in the third quarter from the second quarter in spite of record volumes in many futures and options markets. It reported a $10.6m loss, or 38 cents a share, though that was far less than the $1.02-a-share loss in the same period last year.The decline in revenues was partly related to the loss of a large client, Thinkorswim, a retail options broker and unit of TD Ameritrade, as well as a drop in volumes by proprietary trading firms amid volatile market conditions.It also took a $43m writedown earlier this year on holdings of illiquid debts in a horseracing track, which was tied to a former director who resigned this year.In addition to asset sales, Penson also hopes to achieve cost savings through the integration of recent acquisitions including a futures brokerage, now called Penson Futures, and Ridge Clearing & Outsourcing Solutions, a securities back-office services firm.
340;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Deutsche asset arm contenders touted;Contenders for Deutsche’s asset arm touted;State Street, BlackRock, BNY Mellon and JPMorgan have all been named by analysts as the most likely contenders to make a bid for parts of Deutsche Bank’s asset management division.Deutsche announced on Tuesday that “all strategic options are being considered” for its asset arm, except for its DWS retail franchise. It says this is part of the bank’s “continual effort to maintain an optimal business mix”.The German group says the move, which analysts believe will most likely end in a divestment, comes at a time of increasing costs associated with recent regulatory changes.Deutsche says “the competitive landscape” is impacting the fund arm’s growth prospects within that of a bank platform.Parts of the business covered by the review include DB Advisors, its €162bn ($215bn) institutional division, €150bn worth of insurance mandates at Deutsche Insurance Asset Management and €46bn worth of alternative assets within RREEF Alternative Investments.The review also includes its €42bn US retail arm.State Street and BNY Mellon could be among those players vying for parts of the business, says Matthew Czepliewicz, an analyst at Collins Stewart.“State Street and BNY Mellon have both been buyers of asset managers and servicers in Europe, but because [State Street] shares have been much better performers this year they might have more appetite.”The prediction comes after State Street chief executive Jay Hooley said recently that the US group was primed for a purchase in Europe, with banks likely to be forced into selling off certain “non-core” businesses.Any purchase by State Street would add to its growing European asset management capabilities. Earlier this year, the US group snapped up Bank of Ireland’s asset management arm for about €57m.Aside from State Street, Mr Czepliewicz says JPMorgan “might be willing at least to take a look at DB Advisors”, while BlackRock might have an interest in snapping up the asset management division.Another London-based analyst also cites BlackRock as a potential candidate that “springs to mind” as a suitor for parts of Deutsche’s asset management arm.Analysts predict a sale could raise about €1bn, although some suggest the different business streams will most likely be sold off in chunks, rather than a suitor buying the entire asset management division.“The combined assets may be chopped up and sold to different buyers depending on their speciality,” says Piers Brown, an analyst at Macquarie Equities Research.“It will be quite a lumpy deal to do in one chunk and the assets are all very different. It will probably be a couple or more buyers that would be interested.”Aberdeen Asset Management is also touted as a possible suitor, having already acquired parts of Deutsche’s UK asset management business in 2005.Aberdeen has previously made its ambitions known that it wants to expand its footprint in the US retail market, although chief executive Martin Gilbert recently said the firm would focus on organic growth.With any sale unlikely to be a “game changer”, according to KBW analyst Matt Clark, others are surprised it has taken Deutsche so long to consider a sale of its asset management division. Dirk Becker, analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, says: “We have wondered why they have been holding onto these businesses.“They have spent a lot of money to build a better brand and franchise but could not do it.”Assets under management from the units put up for review total about €400bn as of the end of the third quarter, with “negligible profit contribution” from these business units in recent years, say analysts at KBW.“The asset management division has been a lacklustre performer historically, but has been doing better recently,” says Mr Clark.“One has always had the sense the German retail business has been driving profits. The alternatives business seems to be making a nice contribution pre-crisis, but in post crisis environment it has been harder to maintain.”David Ricketts is a senior reporter on Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
341;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-11-22T01:03:30Z;States win right to block $8.5bn BofA settlement;;The states of New York and Delaware won the right to intervene in a proposed $8.5bn settlement agreement over soured mortgage bonds between Bank of America and a group of aggrieved investors.New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman and Delaware’s Beau Biden say the deal is inadequate to investors and that the trustee for the investors, Bank of New York Mellon, broke state laws. Mr Schneiderman asked the judge overseeing the agreement to reject it.Bank of America struck the June accord with 22 institutional investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and bond group Pimco, to settle claims that the bank repurchase home loans bundled into 530 securities with an original loan balance of $424bn. BNY Mellon agreed to the deal on behalf of all investors in the securities.The potential settlement has since come under criticism from a variety of investors and government agencies, including the insurer AIG and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which have either asked for the deal to be rejected or for more information so they can evaluate its merits.US Judge William Pauley granted Mr Schneiderman and Mr Biden’s request to intervene in the case, arguing that their actions “will protect the interests of absent investors”.“The action concerns far more than the financial interests of a few sophisticated investors,” Judge Pauley wrote in his November 18 order, rejecting claims by BNY Mellon, which argued that the states lacked the standing to intervene.“Today’s ruling is an important victory in attorney-general Schneiderman’s continued work to protect the integrity of New York’s global financial markets while providing meaningful relief to those who have suffered from the mortgage crisis,” Danny Kanner, spokesman for Mr Schneiderman, said.Mr Schneiderman has said that BNY Mellon “knowingly, repeatedly and consistently” misled investors. He claims the bank, the world’s largest trustee, engaged in “repeated fraud and illegality”. The two state legal officers have vowed to investigate wrongdoing on Wall Street.Now that the state attorneys-general are parties to the case, they have the standing to request that the judge either reject the accord or to push BofA to strike a more generous settlement for investors.This could complicate efforts by BofA to limit its exposure to allegedly faulty mortgage practices. The company’s shares have plunged 59 per cent this year in part on concern the bank faces unresolved and unknown mortgage liabilities. Its shares closed at $5.49 on Monday, the lowest since March 2009.Both state legal officers have pending investigations into allegedly faulty mortgage securities. Mr Schneiderman and Mr Biden will now have access to files and correspondence BNY Mellon and BofA produce as part of the discovery process. The state of New York has argued that BNY Mellon and BofA in effect colluded to strike a settlement, and that BNY breached its obligation to investors.Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, said the trustee did not oppose efforts by investors to object to the accord. “However, we continue to respectfully believe that those interests are adequately represented without the intervention of state attorneys-general,” Mr Heine said.
342;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-11-21T16:19:14Z;Oil groups turn to royalty trusts for finance;;"US oil companies are offering investors a slice of future profits from new oilfields on an unprecedented scale as they seek to attract finance for the capital-intensive exploration of shale fields.With capital markets weak and companies wary of taking on more debt, oil explorers have raised more than $1.5bn since April by issuing shares in so-called royalty trusts. The amount already makes 2011 a record for capital raising by explorers in this way, according to data from Bank of New York Mellon, which administers most of the trusts. No previous year has topped $400m.“We normally see one of these deals a year at most; this year we’ve closed five already,” said Mike Ulrich, vice-president for corporate trusts at BNY MellonIn early November, Chesapeake Energy became this year’s first S&P 500 company to launch a royalty trust, raising $400m to fund exploration in the Granite Wash field in Texas and Oklahoma.The capital raised will be used to drill 118 new wells in the field, with 50 per cent of the royalties from those new wells reserved for the trust. The trust also receives 90 per cent of future royalties from 69 existing wells, which are already producing oil.That severely limits the upside to Chesapeake and its existing shareholders from the field, but industry analysts said explorers have been forced to look at the royalty trust option, because of the high cost of shale exploration.“New shale fields don’t offer cash flow for several years, so US oil companies need considerably more capital than ever before,” according to Bill Herbert, head of research at Simmons, the Texan energy investment bank. “They are having to look at every way of raising finance.”Royalty trusts are publicly traded corporations that own the property rights to wells or mines and rely on an outside drilling or mining company to extract the resources. The outside company establishes the trust and then pays a fixed percentage of future profits from the wells or mines as a royalty to the trust, the majority of which is redistributed to investors as dividend.Explorers turned to the trusts over the summer, when market volatility made traditional forms of financing unavailable or unattractive.“We have seen some saturation in the debt market and the bank lending market for oil [exploration and production] companies,” said Paul Bjorneby, managing director in equity capital markets at Barclays Capital, who added that oil companies have shown strong interest in capital raising this year.SandRidge Energy raised $800m by establishing two royalty trusts in April and August to fund exploration of oilfields in Texas and Mississippi. Between April and September, the company’s market capitalisation fell by more than half to a trough of $2bn. At that level, issuing shares would have meant significantly diluting existing shareholders.The market bounce in October has ended a six-month drought of common equity issuance by oil explorers, with almost $900m raised by three different companies this month. But with markets still volatile, the Chesapeake deal shows even bigger companies are considering royalty trusts as a stable source of capital."
343;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-11-21T13:22:52Z;Gulf bond issuers pressed on transparency;;"Exactly two years ago Dubai was plunged into a debt crisis few saw coming. As investors sold off the emirate’s debt, bondholders and foreign governments were caught short as they tried to work out whom to call for information.Now as the region is swept by unprecedented unrest, bondholders are again asking how their holdings will be affected by the violence engulfing countries from Bahrain to Egypt.In the Gulf’s embryonic bond market, the concept of investor relations is little developed or understood except by the largest, most global institutions. The
window for debt sales has reopened after a sale by Abu Dhabi’s International Petroleum Investment Co, but companies and governments are coming under pressure to offer more information if they want to keep their costs down.“Even if the story is not flattering, it’s still better to tell it,” says Michael Grifferty, president of the Gulf Bond and Sukuk Association, an independent advisory group that launched a set of investor relations guidelines this week aimed at alleviating investor concerns.The document provides basic recommendations such as creating investor relations roles at all debt issuers, using English and Arabic equally for issuer information, introducing regular conference calls and time limits of 36 hours to respond to investor email inquiries. Only a minority of issuers abide by even these simple guidelines, according to Mr Grifferty, a former US Treasury adviser.The guidelines also call for a standardisation of macroeconomic data, which sometimes differ from one bond prospectus to another. None of the Gulf states is
a signatory of the International Monetary Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standards and many have been criticised for not supplying regular economic data. For their part, investors complain they are unable to reach company or government officials on a regular basis and rarely receive replies to information requests. Such laxity comes at a cost for issuers.“If there’s uncertainty, you don’t know how to price it,” says Giambattista Atzeni, corporate trust business manager at Bank of New York Mellon in Dubai, and a member of the association. The cost of borrowing in the region has increased as the eurozone debt crisis pushed up European bond yields and unrest has forced issuers to pay a premium.Ipic sold $3.75bn of bonds last month, the first debt sale from the region in months. Since then, Union National Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and the Bahraini government have all sold debt, in a sign that investors were willing to buy Gulf paper at the right price. But the more transparency the company or government provides, the better terms offerers are likely to gain, bankers say.Since Dubai’s debt crisis unfolded in 2009, governments in the region have set up debt-management offices, centres for sovereign investor relations.However, Abu Dhabi’s debt-management office has stayed largely in the background, while the emirate’s government-related entities have continued to tap the market in large bursts.A federal debt-management office and a separate bureau for Dubai have also been announced, though the United Arab Emirates has yet to pass a long-awaited public debt law.The International Monetary Fund in March called on Qatar to set up a debt-management office due to their rapid increase in borrowing. Qatar’s total external debt increased 80 per cent from 2008 to 2010, according to the fund.“It’s the early stage of a long game but it’s going in the right direction,” says Mr Grifferty."

Sterling was 0.1 per cent higher against the dollar at $1.5748, while the euro fell 0.1 per cent on the day to £0.8547.The Hungarian forint rebounded from record lows against the euro earlier in the week, rising 2.1 per cent to Fr308.37 against the single currency, amid conflicting reports Hungary was seeking fresh support from the International Monetary Fund. Analysts at Citigroup said the Hungarian market had become polarised in recent days, with some short sellers targeting a rally back to Fr300 in spite of the negative economic fundamentals.The Australian dollar dipped below the $1.00 mark against the US dollar for the first time in more than a month late in London trading as the US currency strengthened, losing 0.9 per cent to reach $0.9983.
345;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-11-16T13:23:14Z;US asset managers fail to invest in growth;;US asset managers have failed to invest in the growth of their business, even though there is increasing consensus in the industry about where areas of opportunity lie, according to McKinsey.In a study released on Tuesday, the management consultancy also found that greater size is not related to increased profitability, challenging commonly held assumptions about an industry that has resorted to mergers and acquisitions in order to grow.The report said that there is consensus among executives on where growth in assets under management will come from – alternative investments such as hedge funds, retirement products, exchange-traded funds and emerging markets – but not how meaningful such growth will be.“There was intellectual agreement that these were the right pieces, but there wasn’t the same degree of investment behind the intellectual conviction that we would have expected,” said Salim Ramji, co- head of McKinsey’s asset management practice.The group found that in 2010, even as industry costs grew by 12 per cent, just two to three percentage points of that increase was directed to the growth areas commonly identified. Asset managers weighted investment in line with their existing asset mix rather than towards new businesses.The study also presented an industry where companies have struggled to grow consistently over the past decade: only one in five asset managers increased sales faster than the industry average since 2002, and only one in ten did so without acquisitions.Since 2002 there have been almost 7,000 acquisitions by US investment managers, according to Dealogic, with a combined value of $322bn.The great majority of asset growth, however, has been taken by a small number of very large asset managers specialising chiefly in one product area, such as Pimco in fixed income and BlackRock, which has combined its own specialist fixed income house with Barclay’s Global Investors ETF business.Multi-boutique asset managers, such as Bank of New York Mellon, which operate several different brands under one roof, were responsible for most of the rest of the market share gains, according to McKinsey.The consultancy found very little correlation between size and profitability, however. “What we really observed was scale at a product level, as opposed to a firm level”, said Mr Ramji, who argued that generalist asset managers attempt to spread themselves too thinly, losing the benefits of scale to greater complexity.For instance, expressed as a proportion of assets under management, industry operations and technology costs have risen every year since 2005, from 3.5 basis points to 5.1 basis points in 2010, “seemingly defying theories about economies of scale”, the report said.While assets under management for the industry surpassed pre-crisis peaks in the second quarter of this year, profits were 15 per cent below the peak due to higher costs, McKinsey found.

But overall income was 44 per cent lower than in the same quarter last year, as the home improvement retailer has been forced to close stores.JC Penney fell 2.8 per cent to $32.98, on a third-quarter loss of $143m. A loss had been expected, as the department store chain is implementing its own restructuring programme, but analysts were troubled that the company lowered fourth-quarter guidance.Bellwethers Walmart, Target and Staples are all set to report results this week, but analysts were downbeat on the retail sector on Monday.The past 13 weeks have seen double-digit percentage returns for eight of the nine consumer discretionary subsectors, signalling to investors of a statistical bent that stocks may be overbought.Company-specific analysts also expressed doubts that retailers could maintain strong margin growth if consumer spending eases.“With gross margins at near-peak levels, mounting headwinds from free online shipping, and ramped promotions and holiday marketing, we remain on the sidelines,” Adrianne Shapira at Goldman Sachs wrote to clients.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, did urge clients to buy more defensive consumer staple names, noting these had set expectations for 2012 margins lower than any other non-financial sector.Broad indices fell, with the S&P 500 down 1 per cent to 1,251.78, following European indices, which suffered losses despite a successful auction of Italian sovereign bonds.Banks again suffered most from investors' eurozone nerves. The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2 per cent, led down by Bank of New York Mellon, which fell 4.5 per cent to $20.55 after announcing it would take a $100m hit in the fourth quarter from restructuring costs.Bank of America dropped 2.6 per cent to $6.05, despite announcing it will pocket $1.8bn in after-tax gains from the sale of more than 10bn shares in China Construction Bank.Joe Morford, US bank analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the sale, which will reduce BofA’s stake in CCB to less than 1 per cent, was inevitable, “given management’s ongoing strategy to strengthen the balance sheet and divest non-core assets”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 12,078.91, given some ballast by Boeing, which gained 1.5 per cent to $67.94, as investors had their first chance to react to the company’s biggest ever civilian aircraft deal – an $18bn agreement to sell at least 50 jets to Emirates.Also in the Dow, Caterpillar was up 0.4 per cent to $96.53, after Goldman Sachs analysts declared the company a “conviction buy” in anticipation of strong margin growth at the earth moving equipment manufacturer.IBM closed fractionally down at $187.35 – a rare occasion when a Warren Buffett investment did not produce a bounce.The “sage of Omaha” revealed Monday morning that his Berkshire Hathaway company had accumulated a $10bn stake in IBM over several months, Mr Buffett’s first tech-centric investment.Unlike Mr Buffett’s previous financial crisis-era investments in the likes of Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, Mr Buffett has purchased common shares in IBM, rather than bargaining with management for guaranteed yields.Mr Buffett revealed the stake during a media interview on Monday morning, causing some consternation that Berkshire Hathaway had not been required to reveal its growing stake in SEC filings.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 2,657.22, given some support by Google shares, which gained 0.6 per cent to $613.00.Salesforce.com rose 2.8 per cent to $133.52 after a glowing “buy” recommendation from Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard for the provider of “cloud” software for businesses.While other analysts have been wary of Salesforce’s high capital spending on an ambitious growth project, Mr Pritchard told clients: “We believe it is nearly mathematically impossible for margins not to accrete meaningfully in the 2013 fiscal year and drive cash flow in excess of consensus.”Miner Titanium Metals was up 1.8 per cent to $15.88, driven by strong options activity, as some investors sought to profit from renewed takeover talk.QEP Resources tumbled 7.6 per cent to $34.21 after the gas explorer forecast 2012 earnings of $1.45bn to $1.55bn, compared to analyst expectations of $1.62bn.Computer Sciences, the IT outsourcing company, continued its precipitous decline. Shares fell 3.9 per cent to $25.46, leaving the stock off 22 per cent since the company slashed full-year guidance last Wednesday, citing weak demand from public sector clients.
347;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-11-08T18:13:26Z;Slimmer bond inventories as dealers reduce risk;;As recently as two years ago whenever Dan Fuss, vice-chairman of Loomis Sayles, wanted to sell $50m of bonds of, say, General Electric, the 30-year veteran of the corporate bond market would ring one of the large Wall Street dealers and get a bid.“Now, the dealer says, ‘Let me see what I can do,’ rather than give a quote,” Mr Fuss says.In the wake of the financial crisis and ahead of tighter regulatory constraints, large Wall Street dealers have become far less willing to hold the risk of owning corporate bonds, known in market parlance as “inventory,” in order to facilitate trading for their clients.Instead, they are increasingly trying to match buyers and sellers, acting more as a pure intermediary, rather than stockpiling bonds and encouraging a liquid market for secondary trading.The knock-on effect is less liquidity in the corporate bond market. In practice, this means a wider “spread,” or difference between bid and offer prices, and the potential for more volatility of prices.In a robust market, this dynamic means higher trading costs for buyers and sellers. In a period of market stress, however, it could result in big losses for investors who need to sell to meet customer redemptions if dealers are not there to make markets in bonds the way they once were.The trend of falling inventories has been building for years and its recent acceleration is changing the dynamics of corporate bond trading.Amid fears that Europe’s festering debt crisis could infect financial institutions outside the region, so-called US primary dealers, the 21 firms that underwrite US Treasury debt sales, have cut their inventory of corporate bonds to the lowest level since 2002.As of October 26, primary dealers held $49.5bn in corporate bonds with a maturity beyond one year, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data, extending a steady drop from this year’s peak in late May of around $95bn and below the levels seen even at the depths of the financial crisis. Prior to the crisis, these holdings were regularly above $200bn in 2007.But, as Wall Street dealers back away from supporting the business of transacting corporate bonds, new players such as US Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon and Jefferies are filling the gap.Richard Payne, vice-chairman of wholesale banking at US Bancorp says: “We don’t look at this as a bond trading business, we facilitate transactions for our issuing and investing clients.”Companies, such as Brownstone Investment Group, which specialise in trading and investing in credit instruments, are also more prominent in the marketplace at present, handling larger size orders and acting as bridges between different liquidity pools, including banks’ desks and electronic networks.“The move is toward aggregation. There is a new wave of customers coming into this marketplace because they are getting a much broader view of what’s available with both improved transparency and increased liquidity,” says Jon Sablowsky, head trader at Brownstone.MarketAxess, an electronic bond trading network, recently saw record third-quarter revenues. In the third quarter, MarketAxcess’ share of investment grade corporate bond trading volume increased to an estimated 11.6 per cent compared with an estimated 8.3 per cent for the third quarter of 2010, based on data from TRACE, the bond monitoring service operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.“The secondary bond business is still getting done, but in a different way,” says Richard McVey, chief executive at MarketAxess.Corporate bond investors like Joe Balestrino, senior portfolio manager of Federated Investors, increasingly use electronic trading, particularly for smaller trades.With regulators pushing large banks to have more capital and to no longer rely on proprietary trading, their support for secondary bond trading could decline further.But the full ramifications of reduced dealer commitment in corporate bonds have yet to be seen, warn investors. With little exception, the period since the financial crisis has been one of sustained and strong investment in corporate bonds.“We have yet to live in this environment in a sustained period of customer redemptions,” Mr Balestrino says. “That will be the test.”
348;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-11-08T02:17:13Z;Morgan Stanley accused over mortgage bonds;;Morgan Stanley revealed on Monday it is being targeted over alleged mortgage mis-selling by the same law firm that brokered an $8.5bn settlement with Bank of America.In its quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank said that it expects to face increased lawsuits and other claims for damages from allegedly faulty mortgage practices.It disclosed that it received a letter on October 18 from Gibbs & Bruns, a boutique litigation firm that specialises in mortgage securities, alleging the bank misled investors and failed to properly service mortgages owned by the investors. The bank declined to comment.The investors represented by Gibbs & Bruns own mortgage bonds in 17 trusts sponsored or underwritten by Morgan Stanley with an aggregate outstanding balance of more than $6bn, the company said.The law firm’s approach mirrors the beginning of its efforts in eventually coming to an $8.5bn settlement in a similar case with BofA. In October 2010, the law firm wrote to BofA and Bank of New York Mellon alleging similar deficiencies on about $47bn worth of mortgage bonds created by BofA’s Countrywide Financial unit. BNY Mellon served as trustee.In that action, the firm represented 22 institutional investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, bond giant Pimco and BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager.Months of negotiation followed, during which BofA chief executive Brian Moynihan told investors the company was engaged in “day-to-day, hand-to-hand combat” fighting mortgage disputes.The talks eventually resulted in a far-reaching deal struck in June covering 530 trusts with original principal balance of $424bn. Scores of other investors have since objected to the deal. It awaits approval by a US federal judge.In the same quarterly filing, Morgan Stanley gave more detail on its credit exposure to individual countries – including a $15bn exposure to the UK – and disclosed it had racked up trading losses on 31 days in the third quarter.The bank, which has already detailed its exposure to the five most troubled eurozone countries in an attempt to reassure nervous investors, said it had $15bn in exposure to sovereign, corporate and financial institutions’ debt in the UK, $7bn to Brazil, $8.4bn to Germany, $2.8bn to China and $3.1bn to Canada. The bank said it had about $9bn in hedges against those positions.Morgan Stanley disclosed that it lost more than $100m on three separate sessions in the quarter, including one day where it lost more than $150m. The previous quarter saw the bank sustain net losses on only eight days and it lost more than $100m on just one day.
349;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chance to play money matchmaker between company and investor;How wide is the horizon for asset managers as companies scout out new sources of capital, asks Tom Stabile;How wide is the horizon for asset managers today as giant banks retreat, millions of investors scrounge for income, and companies worldwide scout out new sources of capital? Think big, says Curtis Arledge, chief executive of BNY Mellon’s $1,200bn investment management arm.Asset managers have a chance to play matchmaker on a grand scale – the investment world equivalent of the Unification Church’s stadium ceremonies, with row upon row of smiling brides and grooms. In this case, asset managers can skip the boutonnières.What our vicars of investments must bring instead is a bouquet of products – a colourful selection of exchange traded funds, bank loan funds, mutual funds, and Ucits. Mr Arledge says the capital that companies used to secure “from the balance sheets of a handful of players” at big banks will flow instead from developed world investors searching for returns.“It’s an interesting time, a period when investors and professional investment managers are reassessing,” he says. “They want returns but also want to dampen volatility, and they’ll be willing to look across asset classes and countries. And products are developing around that.”The forces that will unite companies as capital-seekers and investors as capital-providers have not gained momentum yet. Key pieces are falling into place, however, Mr Arledge says.The first ingredient will be a heightened call for capital from companies, both in developed and emerging markets. What has kept the cork on that bottle of bubbly is our current global economic funk. In the US and western Europe, companies simply do not have an appetite to grow, and many still roost above stockpiles of cash. In other regions, most businesses until now have been able to tap traditional banking relationships for capital funding.When a recovering global economy eventually builds up pressure for expansion, however, the old habit of leaning on banks to fuel capital needs will no longer suffice, Mr Arledge says. The reasons will differ in the emerging and developed arenas.In the fast-growing emerging world, an even wider push by companies to expand will quickly expose the limitations of banking systems to provide enough capital. A recent FT report outlined how Asian companies already are feeling the pinch in capital-raising efforts, with big banks and investment houses pulling back from financing bonds and loans.A return to growth in the US and western Europe, meanwhile, will find a landscape where new regulatory regimes prevent banks from leveraging their capital to lend at past levels, says Mr Arledge, whose investment unit happens to be part of one of the world’s largest deposit banks. Similar regulatory scrutiny will limit the capital-supplier role of investment banks as well.So what happens next? Cue the wedding march for investors from round the globe.No theme is hotter right now in the US asset management market than the rabid search for “income” by institutional and individual investors alike. As interest rates almost touch bottom and economic activity remains sluggish, millions of investors – particularly the droves ready for retirement – are scrambling for positive returns. Mr Arledge says the logical fix is investment products that funnel private cash into vehicles able to fund company growth worldwide.Mr Arledge says this transformation is already afoot, though it should arise sooner outside of the US and western Europe. For instance, private equity firms are already active in emerging markets, and many will seek public stock offerings to cash in on their investments.And he adds that greater availability of capital from investors in and of itself should form a “positive feedback mechanism” – spurring even more demand from these growing companies.The shift may be slower in the US and western Europe as many companies tiptoe forward. Still, the need to refinance current debt may kick-start the changeover. Mr Arledge says as loans come due, borrowers may find banks balking at requests to roll over debt – providing an opening for investors to supply needed credit through bank loan funds or favourable equity vehicles.Mr Arledge’s outfit would probably benefit from his scenario and it may be first in line to start ringing those wedding bells.Tom Stabile is associate editor of FundFire, a Financial Times service
350;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-11-04T23:24:04Z;G20 leaders endorse ‘living wills’;;Twenty-nine banks are being targeted for capital surcharges and will be required to write “living wills” by the end of 2012 under reforms endorsed by the leaders of the Group of 20 leading economies in Cannes.As expected, the list of “global systemically important financial institutions”, revealed on Friday, includes the major US and European universal banks as well as the big US investment banks. The main surprises were the inclusion of Bank of China, which is significant domestically but small outside of China, and the omission of Intesa Sanpaolo and BBVA, but they appear to have escaped because so much of their business is in Italy and Spain respectively. The measures are part of a broad package of reforms announced on Friday by the Financial Stability Board, a group of banking regulators, aimed at preventing another wave of taxpayer-funded bank rescues like those that followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. New bank resolution regimes and tighter supervision of both banks and “shadow banks”, that operated just outside regulatory perimeters, will also play an important role.The 29 banks will have to hold extra top-quality capital starting in 2016. While the rates will change as banks shrink or expand balance sheets, one calculation shows five banks – JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, BNP Paribas, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland – getting a 2.5 per cent surcharge.Deutsche Bank, Barclays and Bank of America will probably have to hold an extra 2 per cent and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Crédit Agricole, Bank of New York Mellon and UBS are likely to have to have 1.5 per cent. The remaining 15 banks would receive a 1 per cent surcharge, the estimate shows. The extra capital requirements come on top of the “Basel III” rules that will require all banks to hold core tier one capital equal to 7.0 per cent of their risk-weighted assets.Regulators plan to update the list annually and will initially be watching a total of 73 banks for potential inclusion, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said.The list and the size of each bank’s surcharge will be based on how the institution scores on a series of measurements of its size, riskiness and importance to the broader financial system. The package ann-ounced on Friday includes tweaks to measurements based on complaints, but its general thrust is unchanged from earlier drafts.“The reforms for the too-big-to-fail institutions are very important . . . They are aimed at reducing moral hazard so that we can deal with, if needed, the failures of large institutions without hopefully having market disruption and without having to use taxpayers’ money,” said Mario Draghi, the outgoing FSB chairman.The full list of 29 banks is below:Bank of AmericaBank of ChinaBank of New York MellonBanque PopulaireBarclaysBNP ParibasCitigroupCommerzbankCredit SuisseDeutsche BankDexiaGoldman SachsCrédit AgricoleHSBCINGJPMorgan ChaseLloyds Banking GroupMitsubishi UFJ Financial GroupMizuho Financial GroupMorgan StanleyNordea BankRoyal Bank of ScotlandBanco SantanderSociété GénéraleState StreetSumitomo Mitsui Financial GroupUBSUniCredit SpaWells Fargo & Co
351;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Dollar looks even shakier than the euro;;For “risk-on, risk-off”, you could read “referendum-on, referendum-off“ on Thursday. Yet, for all the turmoil in the eurozone – and an unexpected interest rate cut by the European Central Bank – it is actually the US dollar, rather then the euro, that looks the more vulnerable of the two currencies.With both the ECB and the Federal Reserve looking to extend support for the US and European economies amid growing fears about another slide into recession, strategists say the prospect of further monetary easing by the Fed in the new year would weigh heavily on the dollar.Though the US currency has rebounded from its lows in August, helped in part by Japanese action to weaken the yen and the Swiss National Bank trying to forestall further appreciation of the franc, it remains a laggard in terms of its performance this year.“We have frequently described the foreign exchange markets as an ugly parade and the US dollar has by no means relinquished its title,” says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon.The reaction to Thursday’s quarter point cut in interest rates by the ECB supports this view. As stocks gyrated on political turmoil in Greece, there was only limited selling of the euro after the central bank decision. Mario Draghi, the new ECB president, warned that the region faces a “mild recession”, yet the single currency held its ground above $1.38 against the dollar.That interplay in the world’s most actively traded currency relationship underlines how the twists and turns in the eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis are being played out primarily in bond markets and not in foreign exchange.“The eurozone crisis is not really about the currency, it’s more a reflection of the internal imbalances between countries such as Germany and members of the periphery,” says Paul Robinson, global head of FX research at Barclays Capital.As it stands the dollar has fallen more than 3 per cent against the euro so far this year. On a trade-weighted basis against its six major partners, the dollar index is 3 per cent lower.For all its apparent attractions as a relative haven, the US currency’s failure to derive a bigger bounce from the eurozone debt crisis reflects in part how its prospects are determined by a central bank that is required to balance a dual commitment to maintaining stable prices and maximum employment.“The primary negative of the dollar is that it has a central bank willing to pursue unorthodox policy and, while that won’t stop dollar appreciation, it does explain why the euro has not sold off more,” says Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank.On Wednesday, after the Fed kept overnight rates anchored near zero per cent, Ben Bernanke, its chairman, told a press conference that further purchases of mortgage-backed securities – a form of additional quantitative easing – was a “viable option” should the economy require further help.And, rather than duck the question, Mr Bernanke fanned sentiment in the market that a third wave of “QE” was likely. The prospect of quantitative easing has in the past undermined the dollar. The flood of cheap Fed money is seen as supportive of risky assets, reducing the dollar’s haven appeal and adding to the risk of an inflationary surge later.“Additional Fed policy [easing] would be substantially US dollar negative,” says David Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.A recession in Europe, together with a slowdown in emerging markets, would not help the US economy recover more quickly, moreover. So long as America limps along at its current lacklustre pace, the Fed will want to leave open the possibility of launching another round of QE.Some analysts argue the euro is set to weaken. But few expect the single currency to test the low of $1.19, hit when Greece’s debt problems erupted in 2010. “We expect the euro will fall towards $1.30 over the next three months,” says Mr Robinson.A fall to the $1.30 level would only return the euro to this year’s low recorded in January.Mr Woo says sovereign debt worries as well as ECB rate cuts will weigh on the euro, but the bank is maintaining a 2012 year-end target of $1.40. This is based on the prospect of the Fed starting QE3 while emerging market economies continue to diversify out of dollars.For the single currency to suffer a serious breakdown, Mr Ruskin says: “You need to see a rupture of the eurozone core that results in capital flows leaving the euro.” Not impossible, but not yet regarded as the most probable outcome.
352;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-10-23T03:09:25Z;Slow but sure growth of bank credit alternatives;Credit investment companies remain upbeat the sector will take off;As banks draw in their horns, withdrawing from the credit market to build up capital reserves, who will lend to businesses wishing to expand?Pension funds and other institutional investors are one likely source of capital, with large pools of assets and a need for long-term, low volatility investments with predictable income streams.“There will be a transfer of credit risk out of banking into pension funds,” says Stewart Cowley, head of fixed income at Old Mutual Asset Managers. “You’re going to see an explosion of credit analysis at pension funds.”People have been telling this story for some time now, but there has yet to be a significant surge in institutional investment into high yield bonds, collateralised loan obligations and other forms of credit.“I don’t think the story is wrong, it’s just not there yet,” says Curtis Arledge, chief executive of BNY Mellon’s investment management business. “The economy is still delevering, so what you’re seeing is an environment where loan demand has not yet completely recovered.”He is confident, however, that the recovery is already underway, perhaps one reason he is keen to emphasise the strength of BNY Mellon’s commitment to Alcentra, a credit investment boutique that rumours suggest was abortively put on the auction block over the summer.Although he refused to “comment on rumour”, Mr Arledge says “the credit space is going to be incredibly important and we have aspirations to grow farther,” adding “Alcentra is in a very strong position”.David Forbes-Nixon, Alcentra’s chief executive, is equally upbeat. “We have a very committed owner in BNY Mellon Asset Management, which is looking to inject capital into new strategies,” he says.Among those new strategies is a listed loan fund, like the one recently launched by Neuberger Berman on the London market. The emergence of these vehicles is a big development for the European credit market, according to Mr Forbes-Nixon. Because loans cannot be used in regulated Ucits funds, the market for loan funds in Europe has been effectively zero, compared with $80bn in the US. “There’s been a bit of an education process” for the European credit markets, he says, but Alcentra is planning to list its own loan fund within the next couple of weeks.As markets settle down in the wake of the credit crisis, Mr Forbes-Nixon sees some restructuring of the industry. “We’re seeing our business model move towards doing larger tickets with a smaller number of investors,” he says. “A lot of large sophisticated investors are reducing the number of managers they work with and giving those managers a larger tailored mandate.”As a result, he expects to see some serious consolidation over the next 10 years.
353;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-10-21T16:50:11Z;Yen’s fresh high raises pressure to intervene;;The yen jumped to a record high against the dollar on Friday as the prospect of further quantitative easing in the US and a lack of resolution to the crisis gripping the eurozone left the Japanese currency as the last mainstream bastion of stability.The yen soared as much as 1.4 per cent to a fresh record of Y75.78 per dollar on the EBS electronic trading platform, according to Reuters, surpassing the previous high of Y75.93 touched in mid-August. Japan’s currency has rallied 6.5 per cent since the start of the year. It was trading at Y76.12 at about midday in New York.The move higher, which follows a period of relative stability, will put further pressure on the Japanese authorities to intervene in order to weaken the currency, which is driving companies to move their operations overseas.On Friday, Japan’s cabinet announced Y2,000bn ($26bn) of subsidies to encourage companies to keep factories and jobs in the country. “We want to help companies overcome the surging yen,” Jun Azumi, finance minister, told reporters.The yen’s surge came as the dollar tumbled amid expectations of further quantitative easing from the US Federal Reserve.Daniel Tarullo, one of the five governors on the Fed board, said on Thursday the central bank should consider a “large-scale” programme of purchases of mortgage-backed securities to support the housing market directly.The dollar dropped 0.8 per cent against a basket of the world’s leading currencies to the lowest in more than a month. Bank of New York Mellon, one of the leading currency dealers, has seen outflows of funds from the US dollar since September 30, when Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, obliquely raised the prospect of a third round of quantitative easing, or “QE3”.“Our suspicion is that this theme of QE3 and US dollar weakness will continue to emerge as the surprise story for the remainder of this year,” said Simon Derrick, head of foreign exchange strategy at BNY Mellon.That meant the yen had become the only large currency that investors were still prepared to bet on, analysts said.Beyond the prospect of quantitative easing in the US, the euro has been hobbled by concerns about a Greek default, the Swiss central bank has pledged unlimited intervention to weaken the franc and gold has lost much of its lustre amid sharp price falls and high volatility.Analysts said the only measure likely to weaken the yen was significant monetary policy easing by the country’s central bank.“In order to get independent yen weakness, we would probably require the Bank of Japan to move towards quantitative easing. However, this seems less likely,” said strategists at BNP Paribas.In a statement that appeared to put pressure on the Bank of Japan to act, the Japanese government on Friday said the central bank was expected to support the government’s efforts by “underpinning the economy with appropriate and decisive monetary policy management”, according to Kyodo, the Japanese news agency.

But analysts said they expected the Hitachi acquisition to be approved by the end of the year.“The hard drive market is mature and PC sales growth is under pressure, so consolidation makes sense,” said Jason Nyoland, a technology analyst at Robert W Baird.Western Digital fell 9.3 per cent to $24.44 and is down almost 14 per cent for the week after saying on Monday it had closed manufacturing facilities in Thailand due to flooding.Seagate shares were off 0.4 per cent to $12.05.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,209.88 as Apple fell 5.6 per cent to $398.62.The group missed earnings and revenue targets for the first time in several years on Tuesday evening. Despite Wednesday’s losses, Apple remains one of the few S&P 500 stocks to have made gains since the sell-off began in July.The S&P 500’s retreat marked the third time this summer a rally has peaked narrowly above the 1,220 mark.In a sign of profit-taking on Tuesday, investors pulled $3.26bn out of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF after the index had hit a 75-day intraday peak of 1,233.1.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 11,504.62 and Apple weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which was down 2 per cent to 2,604.04.Morgan Stanley, the second-largest US investment bank by market capitalisation, returned to profit, posting $2.2bn in earnings for the quarter ended September.A “debt valuation adjustment” – an accounting measure used by many US banks this quarter to bolster the value of their debt – accounted for $1.12 of the $1.15 in earnings per share.But many analysts had been expecting an underlying loss.Morgan Stanley surged as much as 6 per cent in the first minutes of the session, trading above $17.50, a value not seen since August. But the stock was only up fractionally to $16.64 at the close.Regional bank stocks had mixed performance on quarterly results.PNC, up 0.2 per cent to $51.33 and US Bancorp, down 1.4 per cent to $24.13, took advantage of the big banks’ retreat from consumer lending to expand high margin loan books.But Dallas-based Comerica fell 10.5 per cent to $23.13, as its net interest margin shrunk to 318 basis points, much lower than the bank had forecast, as the Fed’s Operation Twist drove down the yield of its mortgage-backed securities.Intel rose 3.6 per cent to $24.24 after posting record quarterly revenue and earnings per share of 65 cents, despite a 32 per cent decline in sales of its low-power Atom microprocessors, as Apple’s iPad reduced the market for netbooks.Freeport-McMoRan, the miner, reported net income of $1.05bn despite a shortfall in output due to strikes at an Indonesia mine.Earnings per share of $1.10 were 14 cents lower than the same period last year but beat analyst expectations. But shares fell 2.8 per cent to $34.38.The materials sector of the S&P 500 lost 3 per cent.BlackRock, the largest money manager, was down 4.7 per cent to $148.92 after reporting a near-10 per cent fall in assets under management to $3,345bn during September.Abbott Laboratories was up 1.5 per cent to $53.25 after saying it would split into two entities, one focused on research and the other selling drugs and medical devices.Apollo Group closed up 7.9 per cent to 46.74 as quarterly earnings per share more than quadrupled from the same period last year to $1.37. The college said it had improved retention.Defence group United Technologies Corporation was off 1.2 per cent to $73.26, though it reported an 11 per cent rise in profits compared with the same quarter last year and raised full-year earnings guidance.Bank of New York Mellon was off 1.2 per cent to $19.54 after it reported a 4.7 per cent rise in profit to $651m.Analysts were cheered that trust assets had risen 6 per cent from the same period last year to $25,900bn, suggesting the largest US trust bank is managing to attract customers despite facing a federal lawsuit for regularly overcharging for foreign exchange transactions.

Assets under management also increased, rising 5 per cent to $1,200bn. The company said new business accounted for the growth.Shares of the bank fell 1.2 per cent to $19.54 in New York trading on WednesdayNon-interest expenses increased 6 per cent, and its share as a percentage of revenues also rose, from 72.7 per cent in the third quarter of last year to 75 per cent the same period of this year.The company has come under increased pressure from investors and Wall Street analysts to rein in costs as BNY fights to maintain profit levels despite the continuing squeeze on net interest margins. It announced job cuts earlier this year and has pledged to cut expenses.Analysts have questioned the bank’s strategy in dealing with a multiple of issues, from legal risks – like the lawsuits from the justice department, New York, Florida and Virginia – to more structural challenges like BNY’s ability to weather the current low interest rate environment and its effect on profit margins.Net interest margins fell year-on-year from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent, reflecting the bank’s difficulties at finding higher-yielding investments for its growing pile of deposits. The flattening from the preceding quarter was mostly due to an influx of “pretty hot money” into customers’ deposit accounts. For example, non-interest-bearing deposits surged 71 per cent quarter-on-quarter to $73.4bn.“If the balance sheet had been stable, we estimate the margin probably would have been up slightly,” said Thomas Gibbons, BNY’s chief financial officer.Two weeks ago, the state of New York and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan filed separate lawsuits against BNY, claiming that the company defrauded and misled pension funds, US banks and millions of investors nationwide on currency transactions for 10 years. New York is seeking to recover more than $2bn.The lawsuits claim that the bank bought and sold foreign currencies at the worst rate at which the currency traded on the day of the trade, as opposed to the market price at the time of the trade. The suits alleges that the bank kept the difference. The states of Virginia and Florida filed similar suits earlier this year.The bank has rejected the accusations and vowed to fight the claims, describing the claims as “flat out wrong, both on the law and on the facts”. It also said on Wednesday that clients had not left as a result of the claims.“We have not seen any attrition over the FX matter,” said chairman and chief executive Gerald Hassell, who took over from Robert Kelly on August 31.BNY’s revenues off foreign exchange jumped 38 per cent year-on-year to $221m, due largely to increased volatility and higher volumes, the bank said.Separately, in August New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman accused the bank of “repeated fraud and illegality” in asking a state judge to reject a proposed $8.5bn settlement agreement over soured loans between Bank of America and a group of investors which BNY served as trustee. Mr Schneiderman claimed BNY “knowingly, repeatedly and consistently” misled investors into thinking that the mortgage bonds they purchased were created properly.The bank has denied Mr Schneiderman’s mortgage bond allegations.On Tuesday, rival custody bank State Street reported an 11 per cent rise in earnings. BNY’s share price has fared worse than peers State Street and Northern Trust, plummeting nearly 35 per cent year-to-date through Tuesday’s close. State Street has fallen 19 per cent while Northern Trust has dropped 30 per cent.
356;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
357;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-10-18T14:31:39Z;US banks rise despite Goldman loss;;Bank stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday even though Goldman Sachs posted its second quarterly loss as a public company and Bank of America only avoided being in the red after accounting adjustments and disposals.The main S&P 500 was up 2 per cent at 1,225.38, its highest close since August 3.But Apple, the highest weighted stock in the index, fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading, after the firm reported quarterly earnings of $7.05 a share, on revenue of $28.3bn, both much lower than expected.That knocked S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures significantly, suggesting both indices may open lower on Wednesday.Goldman, the biggest US investment bank by market capitalisation, closed up 5.5 per cent to $102.25 despite posting an 84 cents per share loss as the bank’s investments were hit by falling asset prices.Investors were cheered as the bank revealed $2bn in share buy-backs, significantly more than expectedBut Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities warned: “I think the management will be reluctant to shrink the balance sheet and return much more capital to investors through buy backs”.Goldman took a $1bn hit on its investment in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and $1.9bn in other mark-to-market losses. Investment banking net revenues fell 33 per cent year-on-year to $781m as underwriting revenues seized up with the initial public offering market stalling over the summer.Bank of America surged 10.1 per cent to $6.64 after posting earnings per share of 56 cents on net profit of $6.2bn, its first profit since the first quarter of 2011.But stripping out $3.6bn from the sale of a stake in China Construction Bank and a $4.5bn boost from an accounting adjustment widely used by banks this earnings season to bolster the value of their own debt, BofA was lossmaking.“It’s a relief just to get through most of the major bank announcements and not hear anything too terrible,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service.Mr Warren initiated a position in BofA in August when the stock sunk to $7 and he was impressed by the bank’s work to boost its capital position.BofA’s tier 1 common equity ratio reached 8.65 per cent, well on course to meet Basel III requirements by 2019.Trust bank State Street jumped 10.7 per cent to $37.49 after posting earnings per share of 96 cents, handily beating the average forecast in a Bloomberg poll of analysts of 88 cents.That gave a boost to its rivals Bank of New York Mellon, up 7.6 per cent to $19.77, and Northern Trust, up 4.4 per cent to $38.78, but analysts warned State Street’s performance might not be mirrored at other trust institutions.“State Street is less banklike than the other two, which means it faces less regulatory risk and is less vulnerable to losses on outstanding loans,” said Jeff Hopson at Stifel Nicolaus.Financials in the S&P 500 were up 5 per cent, significantly outperforming every other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6 per cent to 11,577.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent to 2,657.43, into positive territory for the year.In a frantic last hour of trading the S&P 500 had jumped as high as 1,233 on reports Germany and France have agreed the outlines of a $2trn European bail-out package, but sellers forced the market back down towards 1,220, where all previous rallies this summer have ended.Homebuilders, which had been sold heavily on Monday as bank earnings figures suggested mortgage delinquencies may be on the rise again, rebounded strongly.Lennar was up 9.3 per cent to $15.92, DR Horton jumped 11 per cent to $10.59 and PulteGroup was up 11.2 per cent to $4.46 after a better than expected sentiment report from the National Association of Homebuilders.Pharmaceutical company Hospira plunged 21 per cent to $29.51, after it cut its earnings per share guidance for the year to between $2.95 and $3.05, less than the analyst consensus estimate of $3.91, because of production problems at its largest manufacturing plant.IBM fell 4.1 per cent to $178.90 after the computer giant’s quarterly earnings, out after the close of markets on Monday, showed flat performance in major European markets.Coca-Cola was down 0.4 per cent to $66.74 despite reporting increased profit of $2.22bn, as margins shrank.Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson fell 7.8 per cent to $34.31. Quarterly results appeared strong with retail sales up 5.4 per cent year-on-year, much better than expected. But margin was hit by the strong dollar and restructuring costs at its main manufacturing plant in York, Pennsylvania.
358;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-10-09T05:22:52Z;A question of survival for custodians;Custodian banks in Europe are faced with a raft of new rules and costs;From the bowels of the earth a distant rumbling can be heard. The denizens of European custodian banks are positively quivering with anger at the responsibilities being heaped on them by regulators. Many are weighing how they might share with their clients the costs that a glut of new rules forces them to pay, whether they will be more profitable by shifting business away from Europe and how they might position themselves for a regulation-related wave of consolidation.In the wake of the Madoff and Lehman collapses, the coming Ucits V and alternative investment fund managers directives have been framed to tighten the rules under which custodian banks operate. The final shape of either directive is still not known, but it is clear that regulators aim to make depositaries fully liable for assets.The directives make a custodian liable for “unjustifiable failure to perform its obligation or its improper performance of them”, including failures at its sub-custodians. It renders the custodian liable for all losses suffered as a result “of the depositary’s negligent or intentional failure to properly perform its obligations”. Losses must either be made good by replacing the lost instruments with similar instruments or through cash compensation.Their new fiduciary duties will range from monitoring cashflows (making sure that subscription monies actually arrive in accounts), to subjecting third-party sub-custodians to prudential supervision, to setting limits to rehypothecation.The extent of the demands is alarming, says Charley Cock, head of client development at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “The authorities are looking to custodians to guarantee the ultimate safety of all assets. Regulators are moving towards an environment where global custody is responsible for the entire asset chain.”Responsibility for failures of sub-custodians is the final straw for some. “My clients demand that I service them across all asset classes in every part of the world,” says Mr Cock. Custodians often have to appoint agents, but in some countries there is very little choice. “My responsibility should be limited to the prudent selection of the sub-custodian,” says Mr Cock.“We are there to support our clients, not to insure every risk from forex to renationalisation.”Even substantial due diligence may not be enough to offset the risks: a sub-custodian could collapse because of a risky loan made by another part of the bank. In addition, in many countries, it is not clear whether bank assets are guaranteed by the state.It is not impossible to imagine that investment in “problem” countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland could be muted in the future because custodians do not wish to take the riskFor a few custodians, this represents an opportunity: Citi, for one, services 98 per cent of its world markets through its proprietary network and relies little on sub-custodians.For the rest, the likelihood is that costs will rise and that clients will have to share the burden. Asset managers currently pay 3-6 basis points for custody depending on the size of the fund, but that could double under the new rules. As Chandresh Iyer, global head of custody at Citi, notes: “There will be a repricing of services based on the changing risk management requirements.”That is, custodians will accept more risk and agree to outsource more services, but investment houses will pay for it.Citi is so confident that clients will be prepared to pay more for custody services it has launched a new offering, Enhanced Custody, which goes beyond the safekeeping of assets and tackles activities such as investment servicing, compliance, risk and performance measurement.A higher cost environment in Europe and the consequent erosion of margins could lead asset managers and custodians alike to start migrating to Asia and the US, which has similar principles but does not apply them so severely.“There is more work, more liability and more responsibility for the same pay,” says Paul Bodart, head of EMEA operations at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, in Brussels.“I alerted the EU authorities to the fact that if it pushed too hard on AIFM and Ucits V and put too much emphasis on custodians, the fund business could shift to countries where the requirements are lower.”Although there could be a long-term trickle of business from Europe to the US and Asia, the more immediate impact could be further consolidation in Europe. Custodians are groaning under the weight of coming regulations aside from Ucits and AIFM. Mr Cock says: “I have been in this business for 30 years and have never seen so much hitting the market simultaneously.”The bill for Fatca alone runs into the tens of millions for the larger custodians. The effort involved in tracking the ultimate investors and reporting their positions and income on behalf of the US government has proved painful. Then there is T2S, Dodd-Frank, Basel III, Solvency II and a raft of others to comply with.The inevitable outcome is a rise in the cost base of the custody business. “Pricing hasn’t changed yet, but when regulations are in place it will,” says Mr Cock.The 10-12 truly global custodians, led by the big four of JPMorgan, BNY Mellon, State Street and Citi, are widely predicted to take the entire global market share within a few years.“Being number one or two in your domestic market can no longer ensure your survival,” says Mr Cock.The three French custodians, for instance, all have ambitions to be global firms, but common sense dictates there is at best room for two, perhaps only one.For now, competition between custodians ensures that asset managers have the upper hand in pricing. Regulatory pressures on custodian banks and the likelihood of a new wave of consolidation is likely to change that balance for good.phil@phil-davis.co.ukThis is part of a monthly series on regulation
359;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-10-06T03:16:45Z;Yahoo surges on Microsoft takeover reports;;Shares in US internet portal Yahoo rose 9 per cent in the last two hours of trading on reports that Microsoft is considering a bid.An existing tie-up means Yahoo’s website is powered by Microsoft’s Bing search engine, leaving some analysts sceptical of the value of a bid.“Why buy the cow when you already get the milk for free?” said Herman Leung, senior internet analyst at Susquehanna Financial.“Its not clear what’s in it for Microsoft, but if anyone has the cash, it’s them, so you can’t rule it out.”Buyers pushed Yahoo up to $15.77, a rise of 20 per cent on the week, on hopes of a bidding war between Microsoft and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce site, which confirmed its interest in buying out the California-based group last Friday.Microsoft closed up 2.2 per cent to $25.89.The broad S&P 500 was up 1.8 per cent to 1,144.04 as the International Monetary Fund pushed for a speedy recapitalisation of European banks, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said she was inclined to act soon. That followed a 4 per cent surge in the last 40 minutes of trading on Tuesday, after the Financial Times broke news of European government talks about co-ordinated bank recapitalisations.Wednesday’s gains left the benchmark up 1 per cent for the week and 50 points clear of the bear market territory it had traded in for much of Tuesday.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, warned: “It’s still difficult for retail and institutional investors to commit to this market. With volatility still elevated, it’s a day trader’s market.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent to 10,939.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 2,460.51.Bank of New York Mellon fell 2.9 per cent to $18.28 after the bank was hit by government lawsuits for allegedly systematically mispricing forex transactions for clients over 10 years. That briefly pushed down shares in all the major US trust banks as investors absorbed further reputational damage to the industry.But State Street, which is subject to a separate $54m civil lawsuit for forex mispricing, closed up 1.3 per cent to $32.47, and Northern Trust, which is not subject to litigation, was also up 1 per cent to $36.37.Brad Hintz, trust bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the financial implications of the lawsuits facing State Street and BNY Mellon were manageable.“Fraud is hard to prove. And although this will encourage more civil lawsuits, the dollar amounts involved aren’t large,” he said.Residential real estate investment trusts suffered in the morning session.Equity Residential fell 1 per cent to $51.70 and AvalonBay Communities was off 1.2 per cent to $111.55.Reits have attracted flows from yield-seeking investors because they are required to pay out any profits in dividends. They have been able to take advantage of a recovery in the rental market faster than commercial reits, because tenancies come up for renewal more frequently. But their dependence on short-term funding from the repo market is worrying some investors.Sectoral movements in the S&P 500 hinted at positive sentiment.Cyclical materials and energy stocks were up 4.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, whose share price has been hit by concerns over Chinese demand, jumped 12 per cent to $19.70. Refiner Tesoro was up 13.8 per cent to $21.95.Apple inched up 1.5 per cent to $378.25. Investors were underwhelmed by the launch of the latest iPhone model. The stock is down 2.1 per cent for the week.Jefferies analyst Peter Misek predicted a quick turnround once investors tune into the upgrades “under the hood” of the iPhone.Costco fell 1.7 per cent to $80.25, despite reporting fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $27.58bn, a 17 per cent increase on the same quarter last year. Some analysts had expected even better results from the wholesale club, while investors were cautious about the company’s decision to increase membership fees to offset rising commodity costs.Seed company Monsanto rose 5.2 per cent to $66.25, after reporting better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results. The company also promised to restate its financial results for the past three fiscal years as a result of a federal investigation into incentives paid to distributors of its herbicide.
360;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-10-05T01:10:11Z;BNY Mellon sued over currency rates;;The city and state of New York and US Department of Justice have filed separate lawsuits against Bank of New York Mellon, alleging the world’s largest custody bank defrauded pension funds, US banks and millions of investors nationwide on currency transactions for 10 years.Tuesday’s New York action, which seeks to recover more than $2bn in alleged ill-gotten gains, marks the third lawsuit this year filed by a state legal officer against the bank. In August, Florida and Virginia sued the company for allegedly wrongfully overcharging their local pension funds on foreign-exchange trades.The federal lawsuit also represents one of the few actions brought against a Wall Street bank by the Obama administration, which has had to defend itself against accusations that it has taken a soft line against financial fraud.The suit by Eric Schneiderman, New York attorney-general, raises the stakes for BNY Mellon because of the broad powers he wields under the state’s Martin Act, which allows him to sue companies for fraud on behalf of investors in all 50 US states without having to prove intent. Federal securities regulators lack such broad powers.Whistleblowers helped New York officials build their case against the bank. Similar examples to those described in the New York suit appear in the federal lawsuit, which may have used the same whistleblowers.The lawsuits allege that the bank purchased and sold foreign currencies at the worst rate at which the currency traded on the day of the trade, as opposed to the market price at the time of the trade. The suits claim that the bank pocketed the difference.New York alleges the company systematically overcharged clients over 10 years and made $2bn. In addition, the state is seeking triple damages for the alleged defrauding of state agencies. It is the first time the state has sued a company using both this taxpayer fraud law and the Martin Act.The federal suit alleges that the company defrauded US banks, whose deposits are protected by taxpayers.“We are extremely disappointed that the attorney-general has opted to bring a lawsuit based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of custodian banks and the operation of the global foreign currency market,” said Kevin Heine, BNY Mellon spokesman.On the federal suit, Mr Heine said: “Unfortunately, the US attorney does not appear to have made any serious independent effort to assess the validity of the claims in this lawsuit.”The company said it would vigorously defend itself against the claims.New York alleged that the bank “profited enormously from its deceptive conduct”. The $2bn it earned through its conduct accounted for more than 65 per cent of its foreign exchange revenues, according to its lawsuit.In one type of trade, the lawsuit alleges that the bank gouged New York City pension funds as many as 475 times during a two-year period on Taiwan dollar trades by executing them at an artificially high price in effect set by Taiwan’s central bank. BNY Mellon said in internal communications that the rate was “manipulated”, yet it used that rate when trading on behalf of city pension funds, according to the lawsuit.The Taiwan dollar trade also was detailed by federal prosecutors. In its suit, prosecutors alleged that a BNY Mellon trader recognised the manipulation, sought guidance from management and was “explicitly told to use the artificial range of the day”.The justice department requested an immediate injunction against BNY Mellon’s practices, alleging that the bank “continues to reap substantial profits by exploiting [its clients]” and that “it is highly probable that [the bank] will continue this fraudulent conduct”.The lawsuits claim the bank told pension funds and other clients it would execute trades at the “best rate of the day”. Not only did the bank fail to do so, it also hid how it priced various transactions, the suits alleged.In particular, this practice generated “enormous” profits for the bank at the expense of its clients during the 2008 financial crisis, when currency prices fluctuated dramatically, the federal lawsuit alleged.When various clients sought additional transparency, the bank, fearful of compressed margins, negotiated lower rates rather than illuminate its pricing practices, the New York lawsuit alleged. It reached such arrangement with at least 62 clients, according to the lawsuit. However, it kept these deals hidden from others.Both lawsuits allege that BNY Mellon repeatedly misled and lied to clients about its pricing schemes.Because of the expansive powers under the Martin Act, the New York action also seeks damages on behalf of investors in funds managed by companies including TIAA-CREF, ABN Amro, Citigroup, PNC Financial Services, HSBC and Fidelity Investments. New York is also pursuing claims on behalf of investors in funds managed by the World Bank and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, a US government agency that backstops the private pension plans of more than 44m Americans.The New York suit began as a legal action brought in 2009 by FX Analytics, which acted on behalf of allegedly defrauded taxpayers. The state and city of New York then took over and added new claims. FX Analytics also brought the Virginia and Florida suits. As a whistleblower, it is entitled to a portion of damages.
361;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-10-03T18:07:13Z;S&P 500 closes at lowest level in a year;;The S&P 500 closed below 1,100 for the first time since September 2010, falling 2.9 per cent to end the session at 1,099.18A relatively calm morning session ended when AMR Corporation, the holding company for American Airlines, crashed 20 per cent in minutes just after midday. AMR ended the day down 33 per cent at $1.98 on speculation that the company may file for bankruptcy.A sell-off in big bank stocks followed almost immediately afterwards. Citigroup led fallers down 9.8 per cent to $23.11, Bank of America fell 9.6 per cent to $5.53, a full 47 cents below its previous year low. Goldman Sachs was down 4.7 per cent to $90.08. All three stocks were at levels not seen since March or April 2009.Morgan Stanley fell to a level not seen since December 2008. The stock was down 7.7 per cent to $12.47, amid heavy trading in options.In just three hours of trading, open interest in $5 October puts on Morgan Stanley – giving buyers the right to sell 100 Morgan Stanley shares for $5 in October – increased by a factor of five to 24,000. The cost of $5 October puts doubled from 12 to 25 cents during the day.The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose to 558 basis points at the close of the New York Session, up 72bp. That equates to $558,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years.Bank of America CDS rose 30bp to an all-time wide spread of 446bp, while Citigroup rose 33bp to 348bp.Shell-shocked banking analysts were at a loss to explain the falls.“I left for lunch at midday and things were quiet, I came back and the bottom had fallen out of banks,” Christopher Mustacio at Stifel Nicolaus said.Tentative explanations ranged from the reports about American Airlines, although the company’s $11bn is unlikely to sink a bank, to exposures to Europe, where Franco-Belgian bank Dexia had been downgraded, before markets opened.But all analysts agreed the falls did not reflect the fundamentals. “Investors are afraid of 2008, there’s a sell first, ask questions later attitude,” said Mr Mustacio.Dan Greenhouse, chief investment strategist BTIG, said investors might be “derisking in case the S&P 500 breaks through 1,100, because a lot of people think it will fall a lot more if it does”.And therein lies the importance of the 1,100 figure. Although the S&P 500 has suffered heavy selling during August and July, the 1,100 had served as a signal for bargain hunters to pour back in to the market. When the benchmark index touched its previous year intraday low of 1,101.54 on August 9, it rebounded immediately, closing the day at 1,172.88.On Monday, the barrier was broken in the last minutes of trading, holding out hopes for a quick bounce on Tuesday.But Monday’s losses leaves the S&P 500 perilously close to bear market territory, signalled by a fall of 20 per cent from a previous cyclical high. The benchmark index is down 19.4 per cent since its April 29 peak.Shares in trust banks also fell sharply, after Sanford Bernstein Research evaluated the revenue impact of a flatter yield curve on lending margins, and revenue from reinvested earnings.Bank of New York Mellon fell 4.7 per cent to $17.72, State Street lost 5.5 per cent to $30.40 and Northern Trust Corporation retreated 2.8 per cent to $34.01.Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said earnings per share at all three institutions could suffer a 3-4 per cent hit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4 per cent to 10,665.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.3 per cent to 2335.83.Yahoo jumped 2.7 per cent to $13.53 as Wall Street had its first chance to react to news of a potential bid that broke after the markets closed Friday.Jack Ma, chairman of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, which is 40 per cent owned by Yahoo and controls Yahoo China, told an audience at Stanford university that he was “very, very interested” in buying Yahoo.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 8.4 per cent to $57.90 as analysts weighed the company’s sales of the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch I and 550MW Desert Sunlight plants, immediately after securing government loan guarantees on Friday.Micron Technology, a volatile semiconductor stock that suffered heavy selling last week after poor quarterly results, was down a further 14.1 per cent to $4.33, the first time the stock has broken through the $5 level since 2009. Fellow semi stock Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.8 per cent to $4.53 as fallout from weak quarterly results last week continued.Frontier Communications fell 7.4 per cent to $5.66 after Macquarie recommended that clients sell the stock due to the telecommunications group’s dependence on high-yield debt funding.Pharmaceutical Product Development jumped some 25.8 per cent to $32.28 after confirming that it would be acquired by Carlyle Group and Hellman & Friedman in a $3.9bn cash deal.Energy and industrial stocks linked to global economic growth, however, sold off heavily.Wynn Resorts fell 0.7 per cent to $114.32. The company is down by a third in just two weeks, on fears of a decline in junket tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macau, which accounts for up to a third of the company’s revenue.

363;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-29T21:47:49Z;Yuan for the money;;"History may not repeat itself, but in Chinese it definitely rhymes. The markets have been playing the tune of 2008 for months; Chinese currency policy may be following suit.This matters. On the renminbi-dollar exchange rate rest global imbalances in the trillions of dollars as Beijing keeps its currency artificially low, flooding the world with liquidity (and low-cost exports).Back in July 2008, shares and commodities were plunging while financial panic led to a rapid strengthening of the dollar. Runaway Chinese inflation also seemed to be tamed at last. China reacted by pegging to the dollar at about Rmb6.82, telling no one.The similarities to the past six weeks are hard to ignore. Shares and commodities have plunged, while financial panic – this time focused on Europe – saw the dollar leap. Chinese inflation flattened off in July and fell in August. And, as Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon points out, it looks as though China has pegged the renminbi, this time at about Rmb6.39 to the dollar.It is hard to be sure. China is secretive about its currency, which it fixes by recycling inflows into US Treasuries.If it has fixed the currency, there are big implications. Once investors cotton on, hot money flows into China may again dry up, as the one-way bet on a rising renminbi comes to an end. That means less money flowing back out from Beijing into US Treasuries – and last time meant even less flowed on to euros or yen.If the hot money reverses, it should at the margin push up US interest rates, and help the dollar against other currencies. The pressure for higher rates might be offset by investors’ search for safety, but that search only adds to dollar strength.There are a lot of ifs here. But if the renminbi does not soon resume its rise, it will be clear that Beijing has once again quietly pegged the currency. That will give the dollar exactly the sort of boost that investors do not need."
364;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-25T20:30:04Z;Big banks targeted by IRS on tax breaks;;US tax authorities are targeting cross-border finance deals worth billions of dollars between leading US and UK banks as they step up efforts to clamp down on abusive tax avoidance, a joint investigation by the Financial Times and ProPublica, a non-profit news organisation, has found.Four US banks – BB&T, Bank of New York Mellon, Sovereign (now part of Santander of Spain), and Wells Fargo – are in turn suing the US government over more than $1bn in tax credits that the Internal Revenue Service has disallowed over the past decade. Washington Mutual has settled a similar dispute and Wachovia is pursuing an administrative complaint over a deal.The UK’s Barclays emerges as a pivotal promoter of the complex cross-border deals, which the IRS claims were designed to generate artificial foreign tax credits.The cases have become a crucial early battleground between the US and multinational banks and companies in the wider debate over so-called tax arbitrage, and whether companies exploit gaps between international tax systems to benefit their bottom lines.Foreign tax credits are intended to prevent taxpayers from being taxed twice. Some of the deals now cited by the IRS involve a single payment of tax by a company in one country, yielding credit and benefits for two taxpaying companies in two countries.Documents in the IRS cases portray financial institutions and their counterparties as symbiotic partners in transactions that played off one country’s tax laws against another’s. At issue is whether the deals improperly lightened US banks’ tax burdens.Browse the database of documents, drawn from court filings and publicly available documents relating to the FT-ProPublica tax investigation.The US banks all contend that the transactions – known as structured trust advantaged repackaged securities, or “Stars deals” – were legitimate cross-border lending arrangements. All six US banks declined to comment. Barclays said it would not comment on “client matters.” “Barclays complies with taxation laws in the UK and all the countries where we do business.”The FT and ProPublica analysis of court filings and IRS documents shows that Barclays realised at least $800m in tax benefits from the UK government through Stars deals that it then shared with the US banks in the form of low-cost loans.The multi-step transactions ultimately left the US government fighting the banks over more than $1bn worth of tax receipts it claims it was owed, while the UK Exchequer appears to have received a net tax benefit.Foreign tax credit deals are just one example of how tax arbitrage has been profitable for global financial institutions over the past two decades. Participants, includiCharl, gng bankers, lawyers, accountants and academics say the practice is an inevitable by-product of differences between national tax systems.Legal experts say global coordination and simplification of tax laws are needed to ensure that US and European countries are collecting all the revenue they are legally due. “You need a broad systemic solution,’’ said Michael McIntyre, a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit who has testified before Congress on international tax avoidance.That may be unattainable given that countries see some arbitrage as helpful to attracting investors and some governments even encourage it, experts say.Tomorrow: Read about the wider context of corporate tax strategies, including how US companies direct profits overseas using the so-called “check the box” regime, and how the OECD is co-ordinating efforts to combat tax avoidance.

365;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-25T20:30:04Z;Tax wars: A fight worth billions;Foreign tax credits are at the heart of the dispute;"Judge Patrick J. Schiltz, one of seven US federal judges in the state of Minnesota, is an educated man. He earned his degree from Harvard Law School, won a coveted clerkship for US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and served as a law professor for more than a decade before joining the bench in 2006.But when Wells Fargo, a retail banking giant, and the US Internal Revenue Service squared off in his courtroom last year over the legality of a complicated tax scheme – known as a “STARS’ – Judge Schiltz quickly realised even he was not equipped to parse the facts.“I fear I may finally have met my match,” Judge Schiltz told the court. “We may need a translator in this case, someone who can help us to understand these complex transactions and understand the complex tax laws to put this into English for us.”The growth of an arcane, intellectually demanding area of high finance that generated hundreds of millions of dollars for banks and multinational companies is being dissected from Minnesota to Iowa to Washington DC as the US government pursues what it calls tax avoidance fueled by the use of artificial foreign tax credits.The STARS cases have become a crucial battleground in the IRS challenge of billions of dollars of foreign tax credits claimed in the past decade. STARS – short for “structured trust advantaged repackaged securities” – were deals between US banks and Barclays in London.At issue is whether the transactions had a legitimate business purpose or were designed specifically to generate improper US tax credits.Barclays emerges as a key player in strategizing how to make money from working asymmetries in tax systems. In the deals in question, it realized at least $800m in tax savings from the UK government, which it shared with other parties, according to an analysis of US court and IRS documents by the Financial Times and ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news organization.The STARS disputes have produced a vast number of court documents – in bankruptcy, district, tax and claims courts – that offer rarely seen details about the secretive world of structured finance. Revelations about the deals arise amid a much larger political debate about corporate profits, tax fairness, and global competition.As the 2012 election year looms, President Barack Obama is facing direct challenges from Republicans about how best to reduce the US corporate tax rate – at 35 percent one of the world’s highest – and why so many American businesses leave profits overseas.The IRS has been battling six US banks – BB&T Corp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Sovereign Bancorp (now a unit of Banco Santander), Wachovia Corp, Washington Mutual Inc and Wells Fargo & Co – over tax credits they reaped through STARS. In one instance involving BB&T, the IRS contends in a motion that the US bank claimed up to $2 in US tax credits for every $1 in tax paid, “grossly exploiting tax law.’’BB&T, based in North Carolina, responded in court that it participated “to maximize profits’’ and not “to avoid or evade’’ taxes.The US banks all say their deals had economic substance because Barclays provided them with billions in financing at below-market costs. But each lending arrangement involved a series of transactions, including the creation of a trust and subsidiaries that provided significant tax breaks.The US government, in recent court filings, contends STARS was a highly complex tax shelter transaction used by the American banks to generate foreign tax credits. Its lawyers allege that a BB&T and a Wells Fargo deal were a “sham.’’ With Wells Fargo, government lawyers said STARS was a “ruse’’ by Barclays so that the US bank’s “entire economic profit would be totally and exclusively sourced from U.S. foreign tax credits.’’ Wells Fargo, in court papers, says its deal with Barclays was a lawful reduced-cost loan.US banks and Barclays declined to comment on the pending cases. Washington Mutual has settled, agreeing in bankruptcy court last year to forego $160m in claimed tax credits. Wachovia is proceeding administratively with its dispute. The other US banks are seeking repayment for tax credits totaling more than $1bn that were disallowed. The IRS and Barclays are not engaged in a court dispute.The cases are a high-stakes battle for the IRS, particularly because the tax agency and the US Treasury gave notice in 1997 that it would issue more regulations on foreign tax credits to curb “abusive tax-motivated transactions.’’ But the IRS and Treasury never issued new regulations and in 2004 both withdrew the earlier notice.Participants in the market say they believed the government was signaling then that it would not challenge such deals. So when the Treasury and IRS proposed new regulations in 2007 and the IRS began turning down tax credits, financial and other firms were caught unawares, they said.US and UK tax officials declined to discuss them, saying they are forbidden by law to comment on individual tax cases. Although US says the STARS deals violate rules, it is not known whether the UK authorities are challenging them. The UK tax authority appears to have benefited in at least some of the cases.More than three dozen bankers, lawyers and accountants interviewed for this article would not speak publicly about deals that involved foreign tax credits, saying it could jeopardize their jobs. But all characterized their work as legitimate and a sort of “cat-and-mouse’’ game with tax authorities. The authorities would close down a loophole; financiers would look for another, they said.“Bankers looked on it as something to make money with. Young lawyers and accountants looked on it as a game,” says one British lawyer directly involved in the deals said. “It is not hard to fool the parliamentary draftsmen.’’DROP CAP OPP Foreign tax credits are designed in US law to prevent the double taxation of companies that do business overseas. Because US companies are taxed on their worldwide income, they are allowed credit for taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions so as to keep their tax bill essentially neutral.But foreign tax credits have long been open to abuse.In STARS cases, for example, the IRS contends that US companies pursued “foreign tax credit generator’’ schemes to reap credits even when there was no double-taxation. (The IRS is also litigating cases involving other transactions – not STARS – in which US firms indirectly borrowed funds from a foreign bank and received tax credit.) <—THIS REALLY NECESSARY?Such deals have wound down [THIS MEANS IT’S ALL OVER??]because of tax probes and enhanced regulation, and because the global credit crisis changed attitudes toward risk. But a look back at STARS reveals how the deals were born and the zeal of those financiers who sought – and continue to seek – to push the envelope in structured finance. AGAIN, TELL SAY WHY DIGGING UP HISTORY IS RELEVENT TODAYThe UK-US deals were crafted with a certain amount of confidence and ease during the mid-1990s when financial engineers on both sides of the Atlantic saw potential for savings, one participant said. “The UK equivalent of a foreign tax credit generator scheme was a partnership deal,’’ he said. “What the US calls foreign tax credit we call double tax relief. What made the US-UK deals so attractive were the English language, a foreign tax credit system and the rules-based legal system.’’In the past decade, Barclays was known for a bold approach to tax arbitrage – the art of playing one country’s tax laws off another. Its structured finance team was considered among the most aggressive of international moneymakers.The Structured Capital Markets unit was led in the 1990s by Roger Jenkins, whose focus on corporate tax planning made him reportedly one of London’s highest paid bankers. Iain Abrahams, a tall Scot who joined the investing arm of the bank in 1995, was considered the wizard behind the deals, according to half a dozen people who worked or did business with him.Mr Abrahams remains a senior executive at Barclays Capital; Mr Jenkins left in 2009. US lawyers [ACTING FOR WHOM?] are seeking depositions from at least seven Barclays employees and the bank would make no one available for comment. Mr Jenkins also declined comment.The IRS was unaware for years, as were some other countries’ tax authorities, that banks and other financial firms were relying so heavily on foreign tax credits, bankers and officials said in interviews.American International Group – better known as AIG – is characterized as a pioneer in structuring transactions with foreign tax credits, arranging deals as early as 1993, according to court documents. At the helm of its development unit was a young Joseph Cassano, the same financier who headed AIG’s London-based finance unit that imploded so spectacularly in 2008. Companies such as Hewlett-Packard, the global technology giant, also engaged in the transactions. Banks were the most frequent partners.A turning point came in the late 1990s when banks realised they could do deals with each other. Knowledgeable senior bankers said they were eager to move away from corporate customers who typically were not adept with structuring complex deals. “It became a cosy world,’’ said one. “You are dealing with your friends. You chat together, play golf together and move around each others institutions.”Over time, the scale of the deals increased significantly as the sharp reduction in interest rates encouraged much bigger deals to create the same tax benefits. In the early 1990s deals were $150m-$200m in size; by 2003, the loans were 10- to 20-fold bigger, said two bankers active in the market.Banks also copied each others’ deals. “It was just like the credit boom,” said one prominent financier. Accountancy and law firms were involved, according to marketing documents and court papers reviewed by the FT and ProPublica.The authorities tried to catch up. In 2004, the UK, US, Canada and Australia formed a Joint International Tax Shelter Information Centre to curb abusive tax transactions. Soon after, the US tax authority was alerted to questionable transactions by its British counterparts within Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs Office.The UK later passed measures that caused a “large portfolio’’ of AIG transactions in Britain to be terminated, according to public filings. The US began its own investigations – and was helped by the international effort.The joint tax centre uncovered multiple possible cases that could impact on the US tax base. The IRS was alerted to “things we would never have picked up or would have been picked up years down the road,” IRS commission ??MISSING?? Mark Everson told the FT in 2005.By May 2006, he informed the US Senate finance committee that the IRS was “aware of 11 structured financing transaction with an estimate $3.5bn at issue.’’ It was not long after that the IRS began denying STARS’s tax credits. In 2008, the IRS noted in a memorandum that the foreign tax credit deals had caused a “significant drain on the US Treasury.’’Bankers and advisers say that tax-driven structured finance is now a fringe activity. Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte LLP said, in the current financial climate, “I don’t think aggressive planning will come back seriously for years and years.’’Dave Hartnett, permanent secretary for tax for HM Revenue & Customs, sees closer cooperation among tax authorities as helping to quell the deals. But revenue authorities recognize the market forces at play, he says.“There has been increased tax transparency from many banks,’’ he adds. “But have foreign tax credit generators been closed down completely? No, I don’t think so.’’ The international task force, he says is still “busy exchanging information.’’"
366;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-21T20:07:05Z;US investors eye European blue-chips;;US investors say they are buying shares in high dividend paying European blue-chips, which are at their lowest levels since March 2009 in the wake of the region’s debt crisis.The Euro Stoxx index of the 50 biggest eurozone companies is down 8.3 per cent so far this month, against the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down 1.9 per cent.That difference in performance has not escaped the attention of some US investors. “I don’t see how a company like Unilever is any more exposed to the Greek or Italian consumer than its US counterparts”, say Oliver Pursche, at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.“If you have a long-term orientation, European blue-chips are trading at incredible valuations right now”As recently as April, Mr Pursche’s “Dividend Buster” fund only held shares in US multinationals. But more than a quarter of assets are now allocated to European blue-chips, including oil companies Total and Royal Dutch Shell, and Anglo-Dutch consumer product maker, Unilever.With the 10-year US Treasury bond yielding less than 2 per cent, the key motive for US buyers seems to be the search for yield.According to research by Credit Suisse, a third of eurozone stocks have a dividend yield greater than 4 per cent, a higher proportion than in any other region.But there are risks for US investors in targeting European multinationals: namely the greater weighting of financials, at a time when exposure to government debt makes bank stocks risky.US funds, which are restricted by mandate to investing in domestic securities, are taking on direct exposure to European corporates through the American depositary receipts, securities issued by foreign companies but traded on US exchanges.ADR issuance by eurozone companies so far this month is a third higher than the same period last year, according to Bank of New York Mellon, which acts as the depositary institution for the majority of ADRs.
367;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-20T23:14:20Z;Nasdaq sued over swaps trade pricing;;Nasdaq’s effort at expanding into the business of clearing interest rate swaps has run into resistance, with one of its customers filing a lawsuit, accusing it of inaccurate pricing.Jefferies, an investment bank, filed suit against the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq OMX, alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and other misconduct.The dispute arises from $180m in swap trades Jefferies made with DRW Trading Group. Jefferies said that to clear the trades, IDGC converted them into what it claimed were “economically equivalent” futures positions. Jefferies alleges that in doing so, IDGC failed accurately to price the swaps.Nasdaq said: “IDCG and its clearing house acted in full accordance with its rules, the relevant contract specifications and the agreements that Jefferies signed.”Nasdaq added that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, IDGC’s regulator, has stated in writing to Jefferies that there were ”no grounds” to conclude that IDCG violated its rules or contract specifications. “Therefore, the suit is without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it,” the exchange group said.The CFTC confirmed that it had written to Jefferies.The clearing of over-the-counter derivatives has become a focus of regulators since the financial crisis. The business is dominated by LCH.Clearnet, with the CME Group and others trying to gain share.IDCG has been trying to clear interest rate swaps since December 2008 after it was granted a Derivatives Clearing Organisation designation from the CFTC. IDCG, however, only secured a handful of members for its clearing house, such as MF Global, BNY Mellon and Newedge.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, said: “While the lawsuit may not ultimately prove successful, we believe facts revealed in the lawsuit cast IDCG’s future success into serious doubt.”IDCG has set itself apart with its clearing process by seeking to take OTC interest rate swaps and turn them into economically equivalent listed futures.Last March, two DRW employees and a Columbia University professor co-wrote a paper that said IDCG’s valuation method for swap futures causes “substantial deviations in valuation with respect to a non-cleared interest rate swap”.“If market participants don’t trust the product, they simply will stay away,” said Mr O’Shaughnessy. “IDCG has always been a long shot from our perspective.”Don Wilson, chief executive officer at DRW, said: “We’re not named in the suit because we didn’t do anything wrong and we entered into a settlement agreement with them.”Jefferies said: “The complaint speaks for itself.”Additional Reporting by Tom Braithwaite
368;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-20T16:02:54Z;IT underpins financial sector’s growth plans;Paul Taylor reports on the role of technology in an industry reshaped by mergers, regulatory change and the drive to cut costs;Jes Staley, chief executive of JPMorgan’s investment bank, has a dashboard chart on his Manhattan office wall that details the progress of the bank’s technology “Strategic Re-engineering Program”.It includes metrics on the project, which aims to deliver $1.3bn in business benefits, as well as on the progress in decommissioning legacy computer systems, some dating back to before the merger of JPMorgan and Chase Manhattan in 2000.The chart indicates the pivotal role technology plays at JPMorgan and encapsulates some of the biggest challenges facing retail and investment banks and the broader financial services industry.Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers three years ago, the industry has been reshaped by a stream of mergers and acquisitions, significant regulatory changes and, perhaps most importantly, the drive to cut costs by replacing people with IT.Some are trying to parlay these challenges into competitive advantage by restructuring their operations around new, “lean” and in some cases, cloud-based technologies.At JPMorgan the trigger was the purchase of Bear Stearns in 2008.“As we pushed ahead with the merger integration on a very tight timeline, we realised that we needed to kick off a more strategic re-engineering programme,” says Paul Compton, chief administrative officer of JPMorgan’s investment bank.He describes the programme as “one of the most important strategic endeavours inside the investment bank.”“It became very clear to us that we had a highly fragmented infrastructure, some of which, quite frankly, dated back to the Morgan Chase merger,” says Mr Compton.“We had a lot of very duplicative technology, we had multiple derivative platforms, multiple loan platforms, multiple securities platforms, and we had a lot of manual processes.“It was a very expensive technology to run due to some of the duplication and fragmentation, which all gave rise to a level of operating risk we were not very comfortable with.”As a result of the re-engineering programme, JPMorgan is in the process of rationalising its derivative trading platforms from 14 to just two – one for fixed income and one for equities.Lloyds, the UK’s largest banking group, faced similar problems after it acquired HBOS and has been working with DataFlux, part of SAS, the business intelligence software company, on a project to manage its data for regulatory compliance and integrate the merged entity’s risk control systems into a single operation.“The project has involved managing three types of critical risk data within Lloyd’s wholesale division in order to improve their quality, audit the flows of data and ensure that there is a robust and documented process for the calculation of and management of liquidity risk,” says DataFlux.The company says improvements in the quality of information feeding the integrated risk system have given the bank a more accurate picture of its liquidity position and have ultimately freed an additional £300m ($470m) for investment.Such measures are also fundamental to compliance, with regulations such as the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the Basel banking regime.Regulatory changes have included much higher capital requirements, forcing investment banks either to scale back capital-intensive activities – particularly fixed-income trading, their core source of revenues – or to drive enormous volume through their trading engines to achieve the lowest costs per trade.Faced with such choices some banks, including Switzerland’s UBS and the UK’s Royal Bank of Scotland have scaled back their investment banking ambitions.For the largest groups, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase, the challenge is to build an integrated global business without spending too much chasing growth in emerging markets.Technology, rather than people, will be at the forefront of that battle, say senior bankers and technology specialists.That means cutting transaction costs, while providing differentiated products that make it possible to squeeze the maximum revenue out of the most important clients.On the cost side, banks and others in the financial services industry including brokerages and insurance firms, are looking to on-demand and cloud-based technologies to enable them to cut costs.But as David Furlonger, who is in charge of research for the banking and investment services industry at Gartner, notes: “The way cloud computing is adopted in financial services is particularly affected by issues of security, privacy and control.“The key challenge for financial firms is not whether they use cloud computing, but in what form – public, community or private – and for what purposes.”Most banks have already adopted cloud computing, but in the main they are using it internally rather than the more risky public cloud option.At a recent dinner of Swiss bankers, most expressed enthusiasm for cloud computing, but without exception they said they would not use public clouds until security and data privacy issues were resolved.“It is simply too risky for the moment,” one Swiss bank chief information officer said.Similarly, in the US, most banks have a cloud strategy but have serious reservations about public cloud services.“My bank is very focused on cloud,” says Daniel Conroy, who is in charge of information security at Bank of New York Mellon. “But from a corporate standpoint, we look at cloud from an internal standpoint rather than an external standpoint for the obvious reasons.“The challenges vary from the external to internal, but with customer data, we cannot risk putting it up in an area where it is vulnerable and most service providers will not accept the liability associated with lost data. That is a huge consideration for any financial institution.”But Mr Conroy also believes this will change.“As soon as there are key management utilities that allow on-the-move encryption, using [public] clouds will just become another subscription service. We will just encrypt the data as it goes up to the cloud and it will then be protected. Then it won’t make any difference that the service provider’s liability is limited,” he says.Another important area of IT investment for financial services companies with large customer bases is the processing and use of “big data” – the huge volumes of information generated by credit card terminals, ATMs and other payment systems. Some banks are using specialists such as Informatica and Teradata to analyse the data flows and attempt to turn this to competitive advantage.In Malaysia, Maybank used an analytical customer relationship management system from Teradata to build more detailed pictures of customers.The bank was then able to target specific individuals with relevant services and products.Institutions such as JPMorgan, Lloyds and Maybank underscore the fact that, in the banking and financial services industry, technology can help address challenges of regulation, compliance and cost reduction.It can also help the smartest institutions seize fresh opportunities.
369;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-18T23:41:16Z;Winners & losers: Bigger providers increase domination;Marginal players will exit, but choice will increase as the value chain unbundles;The identification of winners and losers is as long-running a story as any in the asset services world. This latest instalment unfurls around several themes: domination, competition, evolution, cost-cutting and globalisation.The dominance of the big four providers (Bank of New York Mellon, JP Morgan Chase, State Street and Citi) is unquestioned.So far ahead of the field are they in terms of assets under custody alone that it is apparently the height of futility to aspire to join their ranks by any means other than by being consolidated into one of them. It should be noted that few in the industry are prepared to rule out further consolidation, and there is little sign of complacency even at the top of the tree.“It is as competitive a market as I have ever seen,” says Tim Keaney, chief executive of BNYM Asset Servicing.“Clients want a better deal even if providers face rising costs, and they have zero tolerance of error. Those who want to stay in the business face levels of investment in technology the likes of which they have never seen before.”Despite the intensity of competition in the industry, some players predict that the dominance of the big players will continue to grow as clients and potential clients increasingly focus on the strength of their preferred supplier’s balance sheet. “You need a strong balance sheet to give clients comfort,” says Wilson Leech, chief executive of Northern Trust, EMEA region. “This has always been the case, but it’s probably truer now than it has ever been, given the new capital requirements being mandated by the Basel III regime [covering banks].”There is talk in some quarters of an evolutionary change that is taking place in the nature of niche providers, including new entrants to the market. Chandresh Iyer, head of global custody and investment services at Citi in New York, argues that the basic driving forces in the industry have changed in recent years.Before the credit crisis the industry was fundamentally driven by growth in assets, asset classes, geographies and client segments. Today, the asset servicing business model is driven by globalisation, regulation and risk management. Continual rejuvenation is taking place as custody redefines itself. Bigger providers continue to gain scale, whether by cannibalising one another, or by acquiring new product capabilities and clients.But opportunities also exist for new entrants and niche players, whether in fund administration or the provision of analytical tools. Marginal players are likely to exit, but choice will increase as the value chain unbundles.Steve Smit, head of global services, UK MEA and global markets EMEA, at State Street in Boston, also expects to see further consolidation in asset services – not least in continental Europe where there remain too many players servicing only a local or a regional market.He sees sales taking place in cases where a parent institution of such an entity decides the business has no strategic importance because it does not have the necessary scale, and has no appetite to make the investment necessary to achieve that scale. A further and increasingly familiar impetus for sales could be the simple imperative of raising new funds to support tougher capital requirements relating to their core banking business.“We expect State Street to participate in that consolidation,” he says. The ultimate winners in this evolving marketplace will be those players that have an unwavering focus on asset services and can devote to their development the capital and management time they demand, combined with global scale and balance sheet strength, he adds. Whoever might he be thinking of?Charley Cock, head of client development and a member of the executive committee at BNP Paribas Securities Services in Paris, says much the same. The future belongs to those who can do everything everywhere in every asset class, to those who have all the abilities and the critical mass and the cash flow to finance continuous investment as new assets and services are defined.“Market by market, incumbents are slowly getting out,” he says. The buyers are, by definition, international players keen to expand, who appreciate the stream of revenues and healthy return on capital that the business offers.However, the world will continue to need the services of non-global custodians, says Goran Fors, global head of custody at SEB in Stockholm, defiantly.Some observers may feel that SEB looks vulnerable to expansion in that region by the likes of JP Morgan, Northern Trust and Citi, but not Mr Fors. He also thinks it unlikely that new entrants of any note will appear in the industry any time soon. On the other hand, he does envisage further consolidation at the central securities depository level, which will make life harder for smaller players. Size, as always, does matter.So do costs, which remain a perennial topic, along with how to squeeze them still further out of the system by pushing for ever greater efficiency and automation.One new theme beginning to excite debate is the potential emergence of Chinese competitors. There is speculation that one or more Chinese banks, perhaps ICBC or Agricultural Bank of China, could look to move beyond their domestic market and emerge as serious contenders in cross-border asset services over the next decade.This would be a logical development, but it currently requires a leap of faith to imagine a high-profile US investor deciding to switch from one of the big four in favour of a Chinese supplier.However, if a company such as Apple can rely on China as a commercial provider, perhaps banks looking to cut costs and increase efficiences will take a similar view in time.
370;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-18T23:40:18Z;Ucits IV: Tax concerns narrow asset managers’ options;Hurdles are dogging the new regulatory framework but it should still be a game changer;Anti-climactic, inadequate, and incomplete – that is how many are describing Ucits IV now that the new regulatory framework is just a few months old.Tax hurdles appear to be dogging the progress of what was an ambitious set of changes and the result is that the much-anticipated rules arrived in July with more of a whimper than a bang.On paper the changes looked promising: investment companies now have the tools to be able to merge their cross-border fund ranges, create master/feeder fund structures, and operate their funds remotely.The unanswered tax questions, however, seem to have narrowed those opportunities.But, while front-line investment firms have been left underwhelmed by the new rules, fund administrators recognise that some changes will have to be made to the way they carry out their business as a result, although not perhaps immediately.“In the short term very little [will change] as there were not many mandatory changes included in the directive that directly impact the core services of fund administrators,” says Paul North, head of product development at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.“However, Ucits IV offers a number of opportunities for clients and fund administrators over the longer term.”Tom Weiland, a regulatory expert at RBC Dexia Investor Services, agrees.Although he recognises there is no “competitive need [for asset managers] to rush” into using Ucits IV and that there may be “little appetite” to make use of all cross-border possibilities, he does see Ucits IV eventually becoming a game-changer for fund administrators.“The movement of business towards large cross-border service providers should increase [as a result of Ucits IV],” he says.“[But] there could also be potential downward pressure on administrative fees through the reduced number of funds/sub-funds and the emergence of new competitors, and you can expect to see the emergence of administration hubs in low-cost countries as administrators seek to optimise their operating models.”Catherine Brady, EMEA head of fund services at Citi, recognises this rise in competition: “Overall the growing amount of regulatory, governance and disclosure requirements being imposed on fund boards and management companies is leading to more outsourcing to administrators and greater expectations in respect of services.“Also, the fact that management companies are no longer required to be domiciled in the same location as their funds, and that administration activities can be outsourced cross border, is also leading to increased consolidation among service providers and to greater competition.”But administrators are also quick to point out that the new regulatory framework, although potentially arduous, will create new business opportunities. The new rules regarding the introduction of the key investor information document (Kiid) are expected to be especially fruitful.The Kiid, which forms part of the Ucits IV directive, will require all Ucits funds to be distributed with an easy-to-understand two-page descriptive brochure that will be provided to investors at the point of sale.“The initial effort required to set up and publish the first version is significant and should not be underestimated, especially when translation services need to be included and considered,” says Karen Hamilton, senior product manager for fund administration at Northern Trust, who hopes fund managers will lean on Northern Trust as a result.BNY Mellon’s Mr North adds: “The need to produce Kiids is an added cost for fund managers.“The next deadline is July 1 2012 by which time all funds must have their Kiids in place and, although fund administrators are not required to produce these for their clients, many are offering services in this space and all will have to contribute some information such as fund charges, 10-year performance data or synthetic risk indicators.”It seems he is right. In the past few months State Street, Northern Trust, Kneip, Société Générale Securities Services, Caceis, BNP Paribas Securities Services, RBC Dexia, SEI and Citi have all entered the race to try and win business from asset managers looking to prepare their Kiids.Returning to the subject of consolidation, Mr North adds: “Yes, Ucits IV will make it harder for smaller firms to compete, but these changes themselves will not lead to greater consolidation in the market because they are limited in scope and include an easier regime for selling funds across Europe.“We should not forget that one of the drivers behind Ucits IV is the objective to create a single market for funds in Europe. I believe it contains positive changes that should help both small and large players reach new markets.”RBC Dexia’s Mr Weiland says in closing: “The competitive landscape between the main service providers with capability in multiple geographies should largely remain unaffected – but those with only a local presence in one or two geographies may suffer the most.”
371;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-18T23:37:28Z;Regulation: A crucial part of the service;Custodian banks are having to support their clients with a regulatory onslaught;AIFMD, Fatca, Ucits IV, Ucits V, Dodd-Frank. The asset management industry is drowning in a morass of alphabet soup made up of regulations and directives from national and international bodies.“The whole industry has been challenged in the last 18 months because of the sheer volume of regulations that has come to a head,” says Clive Bellow, recently appointed Ireland country head for Northern Trust.“There’s a tsunami of regulation about to break over the industry,” agrees Steve Smit, head of global services, UKMEA, and global markets, Emea, at State Street.In Europe, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and its counterpart for mainstream investors, Ucits IV (plus its pending iteration Ucits V), are tightening the requirements for asset managers to monitor risk, provide transparency and communicate with their clients, as well as increasing the liability of custodians themselves.From Washington, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act means that any investment manager with US clients has to have disclosure compliance agreements with the US Treasury, while the Dodd-Frank legislation is likely to see the use of over-the-counter derivatives become much more onerous in terms of compliance.Mr Smit, along with most of his peers and competitors, sees supporting clients in negotiating all these new regulations as an inevitable part of the role of custodian banks that serve the asset management industry.“It really has to be a key element of what any asset servicing organisation is doing right now,” he says.Nadine Chakar, head of the global financial institutions group at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, identifies four ways in which the custodian is responding to the flood of regulations.The first is education: because new regulations often develop over a series of iterations and may not be very clear in the detail of how they should be implemented, custodians can add value by helping clients interpret the text and understand its impact.Their understanding may be particularly insightful as custodians play an active role in developing the regulation, in Ms Chakar’s second category, client advocacy. BNY Mellon is currently represented at between 25 to 30 organisations involved in drawing up industry regulations, compared with a handful five years ago, according to Ms Chakar.State Street is also active in this area, according to Mr Smit: “As we interact with regulators in Washington and Brussels, we ensure our clients’ voices are heard.”Having puzzled out what the regulations mean, Ms Chakar says the next step is working out what tools clients will need to comply with them. Risk monitoring compliance is a major area of concern for clients who are facing requirements to measure and manage risk in all sorts of unfamiliar ways.Finally the custodian has to invest in its own infrastructure to make sure it can support its clients’ new requirements. These may not be smoothly uniform, of course, as regulations emanate from different authorities around the world, so each asset manager is likely to have a different set of requirements, depending on where they are active.All this activity is fundamentally altering the business model of the custodian, as the emphasis changes from the traditional mechanical functions of settling trades and safe-keeping of securities to more value-added services around compliance and risk monitoring.“The core services remain fundamental but the type of skills you need to make the connections are very different. It’s changing in a big way,” says Ms Chakar.These developments are all likely to have an impact on prices charged by the service providers, who will face higher costs as they move up the value chain, allowing the investment managers to focus more and more on pure investment issues.Some of the European legislation increasing the custodian’s liability will also put pressure on prices.“It will increase the level of risk we have to assume and the amount of capital we have to hold,” explains Mr Smit. “Those costs will be passed on to clients.”Ms Chakar is already having that conversation with clients and, although she warns it is early days to talk about higher pricing being accepted, she is sanguine that clients will recognise they are being asked to pay more for a higher standard of service.Mr Bellow of Northern Trust does not see prices being pushed up quite so directly. “Fees are definitely not going up as a direct result of this. Rather, other things you might be doing to improve efficiency have gone on the backburner.” So in effect the client pays the same for a service that is not updated as quickly as it might otherwise be.This increase in the value-added services a custodian can offer has given a turbo-thrust to the long-standing trend for outsourcing, all commentators agree. Mr Smit also points out that investment managers are under pressure to work more efficiently than before, which can lead to their considering outsourcing more non-core functions.“Levels of assets under management have returned to pre-crisis levels, costs have returned to pre-crisis levels but revenue has only returned to, say, 85 per cent of pre-crisis levels,” he says. “Asset managers are facing a significant need to reduce expense.”This time around, however, outsourcing is more complex than the straightforward lift-out of the back-office that did not always work out so well in previous rounds.Mr Bellow talks of “a move towards componentising outsourcing”, while Ms Chakar says: “In this round of outsourcing, the platform has matured and expectations are more realistic.” It is now understood to be a partnership requiring significant management by the outsourcing partner, not just the wholesale banishment of an entire business function.All of this offers significant business opportunities for custodians and other asset services, but the levels of investment required to make the most of the opportunities may be too much for some smaller players.“We’re not predicting the demise of the smaller custodian,” says Ms Chakar, “but there’s not a week that goes by without an approach from someone asking if we are interested [in making an acquisition].”
372;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-18T23:37:15Z;Outsourcing: A need for speed and sophistication proves compelling argument;There is a resurgence of interest but there are cautionary tales;There is widespread talk of a resurgence of interest in outsourcing within the asset management industry, but opinions differ on its significance.Alex Buffet, director of asset servicing and market data at Société Générale Securities Services, says the phenomenon is spreading across the whole business of fund management, from investment management screens and systems to processing and administration in the middle and back offices.Others say the industry is not experiencing a second wave as such, but a second generation of outsourcing as earlier arrangements near the end of their contracted life and clients take the opportunity to test the market. In one such recent case, State Street retained and extended an outsourcing arrangement for Scottish Widows, the second such reassessment the two have negotiated.The fundamental arguments advanced in favour of the outsourcing of non-core activities by asset managers are familiar. First, the desire, or need, to transform a fixed cost structure into a variable cost architecture. Second, access to external talent. Third, the transfer of operational risk. Fourth, career development and other human resources issues can be ignored. Fifth, arguably the most compelling, technology.“The half-life of technology is shortening,” says Daron Pearce, head of investment management services at BNY Mellon in London. “A platform bought in 1985 was still OK in 1995, but is one bought in 2001 fit for purpose today?” Not in a world where the volume of data being created, stored and transmitted is multiplying at a rate bordering on the exponential.Stuart Plane, managing director at Cadis in Hong Kong, argues that the scale, speed and sophistication of the data concerned are such that the argument in favour of outsourcing is more compelling than ever. A further contributory factor identified by more than one interviewee is a growing misalignment between the sophistication of the investment management front and back offices, the former moving ahead of the latter’s ability to support it.The clamour to stay compliant is the newest item on the fund management industry’s agenda, as it prepares for life beyond the requirements of a raft of new regulation. Ian Stephenson, head of fund services at HSBC Securities Services, says clients need more data with increased transparency, higher quality and greater timeliness.Toby Glaysher, head of global fund services EMEA at Northern Trust, says clients want nothing less than to future proof against regulatory change. “If they outsource, they don’t have to keep up with change.”Margaret Harwood-Jones, head of client segment asset managers and alternative investments at BNP Paribas Securities Services, describes the cost of regulation as a cost of staying in business for asset managers, and says the mitigation of that cost by outsourcing is a sensible thing to do.However, not everyone is convinced. “Outsourcing options are highly flexible but some asset managers, especially in the long-short space, like to keep a tight control over their back and middle office operations,” says Richard Ernesti, in charge of investor services client and sales at Citi.A well-documented cautionary tale comes from Schroder Investment Management, which attempted to outsource its institutional back office to JPMorgan in 2005. The attempt was not a success, says Markus Ruetimann, the group’s chief operating officer. The exercise prompted a bout of self-examination resulting in a global operating model based on a combination of insourcing, outsourcing and co-sourcing arrangements with various providers across the globe, including JPMorgan.Mr Ruetimann concludes: “When you outsource you need to be very clear from the outset what you want to achieve beyond cutting costs.” It is essential to keep internal expertise, and that costs money. It is essential to ensure the IT architectures of both the client and outsource provider work well together to ensure operational efficiency, he adds. And it is essential to put the A-Team on the project from the start, on both sides.James Wright, business executive for investment outsourcing at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, says the lessons learnt inform the bank’s service today. “A number of things went wrong around the governance of the project. We learnt that you need to manage the scope of the project, lock it down and manage the change process very tightly, as we do today.”The industry says it is evolving and changing as it becomes more accustomed to the role of being an external supplier of essential services. In the modern environment, flawlessness of execution is more important than ever. Even the tiniest deviation can have repercussions, for reputation and financial cost.
373;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-18T23:36:39Z;Distribution: Custodian banks clear all obstacles;Investment managers can expect a range of services when starting businesses abroad;Investment managers heap about as much praise on custodian banks as they do on clients, loudly applauding them for the help they provide when setting up shop overseas.An array of cultural and regulatory differences present themselves when investment houses market funds abroad or recruit foreign clients. And custodian banks are often asked to step into the breach and lessen the impact of such divisions.The collection of services custodian banks provide abroad ranges from run-of-the-mill core custody work such as settling trades, pricing securities positions, record-keeping and reporting, to executing foreign exchange transactions, repatriation of assets and processing tax claims. In some cases, custodians employ sub-custodians or agent banks in other countries to help them conduct business.The pick-up in the importance of fund platforms also throws up an opportunity for custodian banks who now bear more responsibility for seeing that they are serviced well and meet various regulatory and legal standards in other countries.“In whatever country it is you’re dealing with, there’s a tremendous amount of accounting and reconciliation and process that needs to get done before a trade settles in a client’s account and is documented,” says Nancy Wolcott, head of of US fund services at BNY Mellon. “It doesn’t matter if an asset manager wants to offer an offshore product that’s attractive to US investors or a product that foreign investors might want to buy, we can offer them a spectrum of services.”The roll-out of au-courant technology helps custodian banks to streamline their offerings as well. BNY Mellon, which has $26,300bn in assets under custody and operates in 36 countries, for example, has launched Workbench SM Mobile, a programme that allows investment managers to view their portfolio exposure across accounts and asset classes, as well as regulatory news and account valuation changes, via an iPad.Wade MacDonald, State Street’s head of sales and client management for the UK, Middle East and Africa, meanwhile, points out that the Ucits fund revolution has also widened demand for custodian banks’ services. “The institutions we’re working with today are navigating their future direction around the types of vehicles and structures they want to have. In many cases, these are multi-domiciled, multi-vehicle types of structures and they bring new regulatory obligations that need to be met.”Picking up on a similiar trend, Peter Cherecwich, head of global fund services at Northern Trust, notes that demand for the company’s services in Asia continues to rise thanks to the surge in the number of investment houses looking to offer Ucits funds in Asia, but lacking offices there. “If they have no bricks and mortar in Asia, but they are distributing, they need operational support,” he says.The quality and range of the infrastructure that custodian banks are able to provide to investment managers also continues to increase. If a UK fund manager, for example, wants to distribute investment products in the US, but does not want to go through the exercise of hiring a board of directors, Northern Trust will find the directors and officers required. “That way they can plug their portfolio in and start going ahead and distributing,” says Mr Cherecwich. “It’s a way for smaller organisations to get access to the US mutual fund market without having to pay all the money to set up their own infrastructure.”The needs of investment houses tend to vary by their size. The smaller a firm is, the more support it requires, according to Mr Cherecwich. Larger firms tend to handle more of their operational duties in-house. “Everyone has a different philosophy of what is core and what should be outsourced and what shouldn’t be,” says Mr Cherecwich.Mr MacDonald says he and his colleagues spend considerable time trying to map out which investors fund managers are trying to sell their products to and where they will sell them: “We also have to figure out the best legal and regulatory framework for those investments.”He argues that the role of the custodian is to free the investment manager to focus on its two most important tasks: running the money and building up their client base. The sophisticated platforms some custodians now use help them to provide the necessary operational support to investment houses that maintain an increasingly wide range of investment vehicles and fund structures. “Our work is to make sure we’re ahead of the fund management industry, so we can give fund houses the utmost flexibility,” says Mr MacDonald.
374;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-16T15:45:36Z;Fund mergers obscure performance;New research reveals that fund mergers are on the rise;Financial advisers have accused fund managers of continuing to merge their poorly performing funds with better offerings, in order to hide their true track records.These complaints come as new research reveals that fund mergers are on the rise again – with 50 funds predicted to disappear from the performance tables this year alone.Data from Lipper show that 39 funds were merged with others run by the same fund house last year, while 81 were shut down altogether. In 2009, when many funds shrank to untenable sizes after the financial crisis, there were 56 fund mergers and 127 fund closures.Mergers have become more common as market volatility has increased. Lipper calculates that there were 29 already by the end of July, and expects this number to rise to 50 by the end of the year. It projects that another 72 will also shut down by then.Fund management groups tend close funds or merge them with better performing rivals after a period of poor performance – or when their size is so small that their fixed costs push their charges to uncompetitive levels.“All too often, it’s an excuse for being able to hide poor performance – or because your fund has got so small,” says Justin Urquhart Stewart of 7 Investment Managers. “By merging it quietly into something else, or changing its name, the people in the original fund can find themselves in something completely different. It’s become the norm for the industry and I don’t think that’s right.”Several high profile managers have recently merged their funds.In the 12 months to the end of April, Schroder Pacific returned 8.3 per cent to investors, before being merged into the Schroder Asian Alpha Plus, which had returned 17.2 per cent.The Henderson Multi-Manager Tactical fund lost 1.6 per cent before it was combined with the Henderson Multi-Manager Active fund, which had gained 6.8 per cent over the same time period.And before being merged into F&C UK Alpha, which had returned 22.6 per cent to investors, the F&C UK Opportunities fund had risen only 14.3 per cent.However, Ed Moisson, head of fund research at Lipper, argues that merging a fund is not always a bad thing for investors.“There are a big chunk of investors who shut their eyes and don’t look at their statements so they could be in underperforming funds and not know it. If the industry proactively deals with that, it could be a good thing,” he says.Even so, he admits that mergers can also be a sign that fund managers were too quick to jump on the bandwagon and launch funds to capture the public mood – without considering whether they have any special expertise in that area.“The technology bubble is the best example: you did see a big spike in tech funds that came too late and many shouldn’t have been launched in the first place,” Moisson says.Closing down underperforming funds also creates a “survivorship bias”, whereby the long-term performance of actively managed funds looks better, because the poor performers have been hidden.Letters sent by fund managers to investors and advisers informing them of mergers or closures have also caused confusion.This week, Franklin Templeton sent a letter to investors informing them of plans to merge the Rensburg UK Select Growth Trust, a unit trust, into a new “sub fund” of Franklin Templeton Funds. The letter stated that charges would remain the same at 1.5 per cent a month.But one investor spotted that the new fund would have an “administration charge” of 0.05 per cent per month.“Unit holders are being asked to vote for a change that will lead to a…increase in charges – bad enough on its own, and made worse [by the fact] that this is for a fund which has been a very average performer – recently flagged as being a closet index tracker in the Financial Times,” he says.BNY Mellon wrote to financial advisers last week to inform them of plans to merge the Newton Growth Fund and the Newton Income Fund into a new Newton UK Equity Fund.Adding to the confusion over fund names, a spokesperson said that the Newton Income Fund was in fact a growth fund in the UK All Companies sector.David Barnett, an independent financial adviser from Middlesex, says the letter he received from BNY Mellon about the fund mergers was unclear.“I’ve never received such a confusing letter,” he claims. “It makes you wonder what they’re doing to their funds – why are they messing around with the funds in the first place?”A spokesperson for BNY Mellon said that more information would be sent to investors at a later date, as the mergers were just proposals at this stage.But Urquhart Stewart thinks part of the problem could be solved if investors kept a closer eye on their funds’ performance, before a fund manager thinks of shutting it down.“I think investors should be watching what their funds are doing and if they’re not doing what they’re supposed to be they should move elsewhere,” he advises.
375;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-09T17:11:27Z;Safe havens are fast disappearing for savers;This week saw the disappearance of the only product offering any semblance of a guaranteed profit;You will gain something from reading this column. I guarantee it.Convinced? Why should you be? I’m not even sure I am. To have any confidence in a return on your investment – be it of time or money – you will want to see evidence of a believable premise, a reliable promise, and a record of past success. That’s arguably more than can be said of any retail investment product currently on offer… and certain of these columns.No account or asset class appears capable of delivering protection against inflation, or dismal market sentiment.For savers, this week saw the disappearance of the only product offering any semblance of a guaranteed profit: National Savings index-linked certificates, which paid annual tax-free interest equal to the annual rise in the retail price index (RPI) plus 0.5 percentage points, backed by HM Government. It was the goose that laid the golden egg – the only savings option that wasn’t too good to be true. Other inflation-linked accounts from banks and building societies come with long lock-ins – National Savings allowed penalty free withdrawals from its five-year certificates after just one year – or 40-50 per cent tax deducted if you’re a high earner. Depositing large sums in conventional accounts no longer guarantees a premium – in fact, last month, Bank of New York Mellon started charging savers for holding more than $50m. .How many ‘safe havens’ for savers does that leave? Gold carried more downside risk at it passed $1,900 an ounce for a second time this week. Swiss francs have had their soaring exchange rate capped by an irked central bank. Norwegian krone trade at a premium, and only via risky contracts for difference (CFDs) if you are a private investor.It is enough to make investors of us all. But that means relying on companies: their solvency, their management, and their auditors. Where that company is a bank acting as counterparty to a high-income structured product, the risk is plain to see – although savers flocking to Yorkshire Building Society’s inflation-linked account may not immediately spot that they are relying on Credit Suisse for their return. Even so, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) now intends to make sure that we don’t consider any of these structured products “guaranteed”, “protected” or “secure”. Not surprisingly, the UK Structured Products Association felt a little aggrieved this week, saying: “We are concerned that the FSA may be overstating the risks associated with structured products and understating the risks associated with other investment types.” It has a point – of 81,301 complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service in the first quarter of 2011, just 34 complaints were about structured products that put capital at risk.Other investments linked to companies are no more guaranteed.High-yielding shares look superficially attractive with prices at lower levels. A number of cash-flow-rich UK companies – including as BT, Centrica and Diageo – now offer higher income payout on their shares than they do on their bonds. However, equity strategists at Citigroup point out that dividend swaps – derivative contracts whose prices reflect the outlook for dividends – are forecasting that pay-outs from European dividends will be 30 per cent lower in 2013 than they are now.Lower-yielding investment-grade corporate bonds have already risen so far in price that they present a risk of future capital loss and a minimal income in the meantime. In August, the average yield on the benchmark Barclays Capital index of US investment grade bonds fell to all-time low of 3.42 per cent.Seeking a higher bond yield means turning to smaller domestic companies. Next week, for example, UK foreign exchange broker Caxton is to launch a so-called ‘mini bond’ for private investors paying a coupon of 7.25 per cent in cash. It has a term of just four years and, as with a conventional corporate bond, it will repay capital in full on maturity. Caxton is not the first company to see this as a solution to corporates’ need for short-term finance and savers’ need for higher returns. John Lewis launched a bond in March paying 6 per cent in cash and gift vouchers. Hotel Chocolat, the high-street confectioner, issued a bond last year paying a return equivalent to 6.72 per cent or 7.29 per cent in it own products – the goose that laid the chocolate egg, if you like. Again, though, it is corporate risk. As one adviser said this week, you might trust the brand, but what about the balance sheet?What, then, can offer a gain from a £100 investment and this 700-word column? How about a bond that has its capital value and income payments linked to inflation? National Grid will be offering one later this month. It’s the nearest thing to a guarantee I can find, provided the last person to leave the City doesn’t turn the light off.matthew.vincent@ft.com
376;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-07T20:58:44Z;State Street launches swaps clearing operation;;State Street Corporation, the financial services group, is to launch a swaps clearing service in a sign that market participants are starting to build new businesses to take advantage of sweeping reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.The move suggests that large custodian institutions – not previously associated with OTC derivatives clearing – are grasping the opportunities thrown up by the Dodd-Frank act in the US to rival banks such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank.The act requires that such derivatives be traded more transparently on formal trading platforms and that they be cleared, where possible, in clearing houses.A clearing house acts as guarantor of trades between two parties, using funds deposited with it by market participants to ensure that deals are completed if one side defaults. Regulators believe greater use of clearing will help safeguard the financial system against the effect of any future defaults – such as that of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Clifford Lewis, head of State Street’s eExchange business, said: “As the derivatives markets evolve, we are increasingly aware of the need for full-service clearing and other services to help clients realise the benefits of the new derivatives regime, through enhanced transparency, more open execution platforms and central clearing.”He said State Street was able to provide the service “in an unconflicted way”.Dodd-Frank gives futures brokers – also known as futures commission merchants (FCMs) – a key role in the OTC process by requiring them to act as intermediaries between users of derivatives and the clearing houses.Banks that have long controlled the OTC derivatives markets have expanded their existing FCM businesses focused on exchange-traded derivatives to include OTC derivatives.Kevin McPartland, head of fixed-income research at Tabb Group, a consultancy, said: “The custodian banks see clearing as a huge opportunity because they are very well capitalised and have high credit ratings and are very focused on a post trade processing already. So it makes a lot of sense that they would step in as a clearing broker.”State Street, which set up its own FCM last year, said it was expanding this to include a swaps clearing platform, on top of existing custody and accounting, collateral management, valuation and risk and analytics for derivatives.Bank of New York Mellon, a rival, also last year set up an FCM to provide OTC clearing services. In June it created a new company based in Dublin to clear futures and derivatives trades on behalf of institutional clients in Europe.State Street has operated an FCM since April last year. Most of that businesses’ clients are so-called buyside – asset managers, companies and hedge funds.
377;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-06T02:49:10Z;Wave of lawsuits engulfs troubled lenders;US mortgage crisis enters new stage as banks face a barrage of litigation that will determine how big their losses will be;The US mortgage crisis has entered a new stage. US banks are still flailing in the toxic sludge of bad assets that heralded the financial crisis. But now they are having to deal with a barrage of litigation that will determine how big their losses will be. The optimists say settlements are being reached, banks are adequately reserved and many of the claims have dubious merit. Sceptics say many more lawsuits are on the way.Flawed process: Servicing/foreclosuresThe supposedly sophisticated practice of securitisation – packaging mortgages into bonds – was, it turns out, not only flawed but built on a foundation of paper. When homeowners began to default en masse in 2006, under-resourced mortgage servicing divisions cut corners on the process to seize back the properties. In so-called robo signing, a bank employee’s signature was placed on court papers even if the employee had no knowledge of the individual mortgage. The emergence of these issues froze foreclosures in parts of the country and kicked off a multi-pronged investigation by federal and state agencies that is supposed to punish banks and reform the system.● Impact: Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Ally Financial are the biggest servicers, in order of size, and account for more than 60 per cent of the market. Protracted settlement talks led by state attorneys-general with the banks are designed to get servicers to pay a total of about $20bn in financial penalties, including writing down outstanding mortgage debt, in return for a release from legal liability. The scope of that release is now the biggest sticking point, with New York and California in particular warning their fellow states that the right to sue the industry must be preserved.Despite the pricetag and the public relations risk attached to improper procedures in evicting delinquent borrowers from their homes, banks say that this is the easiest bucket and that resolution could help house prices find a floor.“If it’s done well this could really help with the housing market,” says one person involved in the talks. “Accelerating foreclosures, coming up with solutions to let people stay in their homes – it’s both.”Parties involved have described the settlement as “two weeks away” for most of 2011 but most still expect resolution by the end of the year.Affordability: Repurchase claims – representations and warrantiesMortgage originators lent money to borrowers who could not afford the repayments. The loans were then sold on to private buyers and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-government agencies that guarantee mortgages. The buyers are accusing the sellers of breaching their “representations and warranties” to ensure that borrowers met the requirements for their mortgages and are demanding that the loans be repurchased. Banks are in loan-by-loan negotiation on some mortgages. To the banks’ dismay, Fannie, in particular, has become more aggressive in demanding that bad loans are repurchased. Separately, banks are facing litigation from trusts representing investors in pools of mortgage bonds.● Impact: Bank of America disclosed in its last quarterly filing that claims from Fannie and Freddie were coming “in numbers that were not expected based on historical [experience]” and increased its estimate of liabilities related to repurchases from $3.9bn to $17.8bn, in spite of reaching settlements with the groups on some loans.BofA has moved to settle claims related to a trust managed by Bank of New York Mellon for $8.5bn. However, officials such as the New York attorney-general and investors such as Goldman Sachs say the settlement is too weak and have filed objections that will be decided in court later in the year. US Bancorp, another trustee, has filed a claim against BofA. Bank executives expect that other institutions will face similar action.As with similar claims, US Bancorp said the high loss rate on mortgage-backed securities was the result of lax underwriting standards at Countrywide, the mortgage company that BofA acquired in 2008. US Bancorp demanded that BofA be forced to repurchase all of the loans because so many – “an extraordinary 66 per cent of the loans” in a sample – breached Countrywide’s stated lending requirements.Mis-selling: SecuritisationWall Street groups such as Goldman Sachs that have a much smaller or no business in originating and servicing mortgages are nonetheless exposed to securitisation litigation, with authorities and investors alleging they were misled about the quality of underlying mortgages.Universal banks such as Citigroup and BofA are also being sued along with non-US banks such as Barclays and Credit Suisse. On Friday, a federal regulator launched suits against 17 financial groups, alleging they mis-sold almost $200bn of mortgage-backed securities to Fannie and Freddie.● Impact: Last year, Goldman paid $550m to settle fraud charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission about the way mortgage-backed securities were marketed to investors. JPMorgan Chase has since paid $153m. The SEC is continuing to investigate Citigroup and BofA’s Merrill subsidiary for their sale of mortgage-related securities in 2006 and 2007.AIG sued BofA last month demanding it pay $10.5bn for losses the insurer incurred on 539 separate securities, whose underlying mortgages it claimed breached the credit quality and other loan standards that BofA had committed to enforce.Some of the litigation is proving an uphill struggle though. A judge in California has sided with BofA in throwing out some investor claims. The clock is also ticking, with the statute of limitations on some claims coming close to expiration.Banks have expressed confidence that they can defeat – or settle for reasonable cost – the new claims from the Federal Housing Finance Agency on behalf of Fannie and Freddie. “From the banks’ perspective this is the perfect plaintiff,” said one person involved. “These [Fannie and Freddie] are the world’s greatest experts on mortgages – how can they be misled?” People involved with the litigation expect it to last at least two years.
378;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-05T17:04:44Z;Wall St’s awful August a disaster for financials;;"After a disastrous start for US equities, August ended up merely awful. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for shares of banks and other financial groups.Banks enjoyed solid gains in the second half of the month, like the rest of the market. But they had much further to travel. The S&P 500 financial sector is still furthest from its cyclical peak of any big S&P sector, and nearest to its bottom.Financials, which make up 14 per cent of the weighting of the S&P 500, are the worst performers this year, down 20.1 per cent versus the broader index’s 6 per cent decline.The S&P 500 ended lower by 5.7 per cent in August, while the financials sector was down 9.4 per cent.The banks segment was hardest hit. The KBW Banks index fell 13.2 per cent.Analysts say a sustained equity rally will be difficult unless there is a sharp change of fortune for financial stocks.“There’s a very strong correlation between the relative returns of financials and the market itself,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank.For banks, fears of a slowdown do not just mean fewer people and companies buying things; it also means falling home prices that stress balance sheets still weighed down by mortgage obligations, as well as related litigation.Financials in the S&P 500 fell another 3.5 per cent on Friday as the Federal Housing Finance Agency said it would sue US-based banks for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.Bank of America has been acutely affected by fears for banks. Its stock fell to just $6.01 a share at one point in August amid rumours it would have to raise capital or sell a big asset to survive an economic slowdown.Warren Buffett’s agreement to buy shares only returned the shares to $7.91 by September, still a 19.4 per cent fall over the month.The bank’s executives and many analysts rushed to its defence, and to the defence of peer Citigroup. They cited a balance sheet repair in the past two years and less exposure to mortgage losses than some had feared.But fears persist over how banks fund themselves amid the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. While US banks have little exposure to Greece – less than $10bn, according to the Cleveland Fed – they are counterparties to large European financial institutions. Many also fear they could be affected by a run on money market funds that own bank paper.Even normally staid custodian banks, such as BNY Mellon – down 18 per cent in August – and State Street – down 15.9 per cent – demonstrated some of that worry. Early in August, BNY Mellon began charging additional fees for cash deposits, citing complexities in managing its balance sheet, as customers dumped money market funds ahead of the US debt ceiling deadline.The anxiety is stark in the gap between the expected volatility of the broad S&P 500 and US financials, which continues to widen. While the US 30-day expected volatility has fallen to about 30 per cent, from highs just above 40, bank volatility is still nearly 60. “At the core of the stress evident in S&P volatility is the perception that risks are growing in the financial sector,” said Barry Knapp, US equity market strategist at Barclays, in a note. “A return to equity market normality is unlikely without a sharp drop in perceived risks in the financial sector.”He said that although Barclays analysts were “sceptical” of a funding crisis – he cited policymakers’ experience during the 2008 crisis in providing interbank funding – “investors seem intent on looking at financing markets for signs that capital problems are evolving into a liquidity crisis”.But analysts are also lowering expectation for financials’ core businesses. Analysts at ISI Group downgraded Goldman Sachs from “buy” to “hold” last week.“Debt and equity underwriting fees have also been under pressure due to equity market weakness,” they said, citing “high market volatility” and “much wider debt spreads”.Goldman’s shares fell 16 per cent for August. Morgan Stanley was down 24 per cent.Though volatility can also help banks’ trading businesses, risks were still seen there, including a transactions tax being considered in Europe.The KBW Capital Markets index – which includes groups such as Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext – closed the month down 11.5 per cent."
379;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-09-01T20:54:21Z;SAIC falls over government contract concerns;Financials lead losses on Wall Street, helping to push the S&P 500 index down more than 1 per cent, and ending its four-day rally;Companies dependent on government contracts for revenue led Wall Street down, after a key government supplier missed earnings reports and forecast more gloom.SAIC, an IT and technology government contractor, reported quarterly earnings of 32 cents a share, 3 cents lower than expected, as revenue fell 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter.SAIC shares were down 13.5 per cent at $12.97.Stifel Nicolaus analyst William Loomis downgraded SAIC from buy to hold, and said he was worried that the government appeared to be cutting back on funding for contracts it had already awarded to SAIC.He also stripped his buy recommendation from Booz Allen Hamilton Holding, the public sector offshoot of the management consultancy Booz Allen, which has heavy exposure to federal government IT contracts. Booz shares fell 6.4 per cent to $15.02.“The whole sector faces a tricky dilemma. The amount of bid opportunities has actually gone up, because after budget negotiations the government now has a backlog of contracts to put out to tender. So companies have increased spending around business development,” Mr Loomis said.“But if those contracts are not awarded so projects can be ramped up, and revenue starts flowing, it could be difficult.”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.2 per cent at 1,204.42, ending a four-day rally.Financial stocks fell 2.4 per cent, more than any other sector.Goldman Sachs was down 3.5 per cent to $112.16 after writing down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.The Federal Reserve Board had alleged a “pattern of misconduct and negligence” at Litton.Bank of New York Mellon outperformed the sector, despite the departure of chief executive Robert Kelly late on Wednesday.BNY Mellon shares were only down 0.2 per cent at $20.63 after Rochdale Securities analyst Dick Bove said the bank was sitting on a “staggering” cash pile.Semiconductor companies had a volatile day after analysts disputed whether burgeoning demand from smartphone manufacturers will be enough to compensate for falling sales to computer makers.Shares in Nvidia outperformed the Nasdaq Composite index by more than 1 per cent, after Kaufman Brothers analyst Mike Burton initiated coverage with a buy recommendation. The Nasdaq was down 1.3 per cent at 2,546.04, but Nvidia shares were only off 0.2 per cent at $13.28.“We view Nvidia as a major beneficiary of the convergence of mobility and computing,” Mr Burton said.Glen Yeung, Citigroup’s technology analyst, also said smartphone demand could offset falling industrial demand ahead of an industry conference.“We expect the tone from chip companies to reflect uncertainty … we do not, however, expect chip companies to lower guidance en masse, reflecting the dearth of actual order cuts quarter-to-date.”That pushed Micron Technology and SanDisk, which manufacture Dram memory chips used in computers and phones, into positive territory in early trading. But Micron closed at $5.74, down 2.9 per cent for the day and SanDisk dropped 1 per cent to $36.27.Manufacturers with exposure to industries other than computing had outperformed in August but on Thursday their shares were pushed back as investors traded on enthusiasm for smartphones.Applied Materials, a company whose chips end up in solar panels, was off 2.3 per cent at $11.06.Novellus, whose semiconductors are used in various industrial processes, fell 3.3 per cent to $27.05 after the company used a mid-quarter update late on Wednesday to lower revenue targets.Not every analyst shared the enthusiasm for smartphones. Mr Yeung’s Citigroup colleague Henry Kim predicted a “double-dip in DRAM”.“We are revising down our global memory industry revenue forecast by 19 per cent on weaker pricing from low demand and expect industry revenue to decline by 13 per cent year on year in 2011 earnings,” Mr Kim said.Robert Lea, South Korea-based semiconductor analyst for Jefferies, who initiated coverage of Taiwan Semiconductor with a hold rating, was also downbeat on the sector.“Semiconductor industry inventories [excluding memory] have risen for seven consecutive quarters to an estimated 81.5 days”, while at the same time, “revenue growth has stalled”, Mr Lea said.TSM shares were down 0.7 per cent at $11.89.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent for the day at 11,493.57, pushing it back into negative territory for the year to date.
380;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-31T23:40:47Z;BNY Mellon ousts chief executive Kelly;;Bank of New York Mellon has ousted Robert Kelly as chief executive, citing “differences in approach to managing the company”, and appointed Gerald Hassell, a 30-year veteran of the bank, as his successor.“We’ve got some management issues,” said a person close to the situation. “This is not a precipitous thing. It was over a period of time. We thought we had to make a change. We’ve got a good guy in Gerald.”People close to the situation said the bank’s strategy remained unchanged and that the departure was unrelated to a recently announced bout of job cuts and had nothing to do with “integrity” or “any pending litigation”.Mr Kelly could not be reached for comment. In a statement released by BNY Mellon, he said it had “been an honour to serve” the bank.“We have navigated tremendously difficult markets and built one of the world’s premier financial institutions,” he said. “I am confident that under Gerald’s leadership of the firm’s strong management team, BNY Mellon will continue to flourish going forward.”Mr Kelly had been touted as a potential future head of a bigger bank and linked to Bank of America, where Brian Moynihan, chief executive, is under pressure. A person close to the situation said Mr Kelly had not left for any such position.In the statement released after the market closed, Wesley von Schack, a long-time board member of the bank, said that Mr Hassell was “ideally positioned to guide BNY Mellon through the next phase of its growth and to bring it to its full potential” and commended Mr Kelly as “a person of the highest integrity”.BNY Mellon recently announced it would charge fees on some large deposits because it was swamped with cash from investors and could not make a good return on investing the money. It also announced this month that it would eliminate about 1,500 jobs, or 3 per cent of its employees, in a cost-cutting drive.Over the past year, the company has come under increasing pressure from investors, who have questioned the bank’s strategy in the current low interest rate environment, its ability to weather structural issues such as the squeeze on its higher-margin businesses and its ability to reduce costs, one analyst covering the company said.“Kelly was well liked and fairly visible,” the analyst said. “But a little bit of the Kelly magic was wearing off.”The states of Virginia and Florida sued the company this month, alleging that it overcharged state pension funds on foreign exchange transactions.Those lawsuits, along with the legal risks posed by the firm’s role as a trustee in ­mortgage securities, may have been the biggest driver behind investor anxiety, the analyst said.In the past 12 months, the bank’s share price has fared worse than State Street, one of its closest peers, but performed slightly better than Northern Trust, another peer, and better than bigger, more diversified competitors such as Citigroup and Bank of America.BNY Mellon’s shares on Wednesday closed down 0.7 per cent at $20.67.
381;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-31T00:57:18Z;US Bancorp lawsuit adds to BofA’s woes;;Bank of America’s legal woes worsened as the biggest US bank by assets was sued for alleged breach of contract by US Bancorp over a $1.75bn pool of mortgages and investors moved to block a separate $8.5bn mortgage settlement.US Bancorp, the Midwestern bank that is the nation’s sixth largest, said it was filing the suit on Tuesday in its role as trustee to investors who had bought into the mortgage pool, only to see the loans default “at a startling rate”. It said that by June this year, 46 per cent of the outstanding mortgages were in default or the homeowners were more than 60 days late with payments.As with similar claims, US Bancorp said the high loss rate was the result of lax underwriting standards at Countrywide, the mortgage unit BofA acquired in 2008. US Bancorp demanded that BofA be forced to repurchase all of the loans because so many – “an extraordinary 66 per cent of the loans” in a sample – breached Countrywide’s stated lending requirements.BofA, which last week unveiled Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway as a $5bn investor in a move that helped shore up its battered share price, said: “While we are still reviewing the complaint, we do not believe that the existing contractual documents give US Bank any right to demand that Bank of America Corp’s Countrywide subsidiary repurchase loans on a pool-wide basis, nor do we believe there is any basis in fact to demand a repurchase of every loan in this securitisation, the majority of which have either paid off or are current.”BofA’s shares fell 3.2 per cent to $8.12.Investors have been jittery over BofA’s ability to pay billions of dollars in settlement costs. AIG this month sued BofA seeking $10.5bn over the sale of mortgage assets.Separately, a deal to settle claims related to other mortgage losses was put under further pressure on Wednesday when a group of investors and the Federal Housing Finance Agency joined the New York attorney-general in lodging objections in court.In June, the bank agreed to pay $8.5bn to investors in mortgage-backed securities brokered with Bank of New York Mellon, which was trustee to the investors. But a resolution of the claims has been jeopardised because some of the investors, backed by the New York attorney-general, say the settlement is too small.The number of opponents swelled on Wednesday and the FHFA, which is regulator to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed entities that buy and insure mortgages, said it was reserving its right to object, although it noted it had no substantive disagreement with the deal.On Monday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation filed a notice stating it may also intervene because it did not have enough information to evaluate the settlement.BofA said BNY Mellon had outlined a “very reasonable process in which it engaged in order to determine to settle”, adding: “We continue to believe those materials present compelling reasons why the settlement should be approved.”In a third legal blow, the state of Nevada on Tuesday accused BofA in a court filing of “almost immediately” violating a 2009 settlement agreement it reached with Countrywide over predatory mortgage lending practices. As part of the multi-state, $8bn agreement, the bank was supposed to provide loan modifications to eligible borrowers. The attorney-general of Nevada said that the bank failed to do so and misled consumers. BofA said it would “vigorously defend” the suit.In one piece of good legal news for BofA, Bloomberg reported that a US federal judge dismissed claims by BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank against BofA over losses stemming from the European banks’ investment in notes issued to finance mortgages for which BofA acted as collateral agent.
382;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-30T19:23:25Z;Whistleblower sets sights on BNY Mellon;;The whistleblower who tried unsuccessfully to expose Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme claims large financial institutions are “above the law” as he seeks to expose allegedly deceptive foreign currency exchange practices at State Street and Bank of New York Mellon.Harry Markopolos, now an independent fraud investigator, has helped build cases against the banks, which have resulted in probes in Ohio, California, Florida and Virginia. The investigations and lawsuits claim that the banks priced foreign exchange trades to the detriment of clients.BNY Mellon and State Street both say their practices are fair and that they will defend themselves vigorously against the suits.Mr Markopolos is working on his own time but says he is poised to receive 15 to 20 per cent of any settlement the government reaches through the US False Claims Act, which rewards whistleblowers.Since leaving the financial industry in 2004 Mr Markopolos has worked to expose financial fraud. And though he has not yet been rewarded as part of a successful government settlement, he said he had saved enough during his time in finance to fund his work.“I can afford to do this for a long time,” he said. “I know where skeletons are buried and I’m going to start digging them up one at a time.”Mr Markopolos rose to fame in the wake of Mr Madoff’s 2008 confession, when it was revealed that the former head of the Nasdaq exchange was running the largest Ponzi scheme to date.It soon became clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission had for years ignored warnings from Mr Markopolos that Mr Madoff’s firm was corrupt.In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, Mr Madoff displayed flashes of anger when Mr Markopolos’s name came up. “Markopolos was the biggest idiot in the world,” Mr Madoff said. “He had a hedge fund that couldn’t make money and his clients abandoned him [so he called the regulators].”The story of Mr Markopolos’s involvement with Mr Madoff is told in a new documentary film, Chasing Madoff. Starring Mr Markopolos and based on his book, No One Would Listen, the film describes how while employed at a private equity firm in Boston, he was asked to match Mr Madoff’s consistent returns.He quickly realised Mr Madoff’s operation was a fraud and began petitioning the SEC to investigate.Mr Markopolos said he hoped the film would illustrate the perils of self-regulation in the financial industry. “Hundreds knew what we know, and if they had done something they would have changed the course of history,” he said.
383;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-28T11:50:01Z;Edinburgh seeks school-leavers’ jobs guarantee;;"Edinburgh is working on an ambitious jobs guarantee for school-leavers as part of a five-year economic strategy for the Scottish capital and its surrounding area.The economic review is the largest and most wide-ranging economic analysis ever undertaken in Edinburgh and is expected to herald a raft of new policies, focused on stimulating jobs and investment.Led by the City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Business Forum – a group of leading chief executives, entrepreneurs and academics who advise the council on sustainable economic development – the review covers the current economic situation and future trends.Councillor Tom Buchanan, convenor of economic development at the council, said the capital’s economy had already shown tremendous resilience in difficult times and the outlook was good, with unemployment in the city currently at 3.2 per cent – well below the UK and Scottish averages. But carrying out a thorough analysis of the economy had allowed gaps in knowledge to be filled in.“A really good example is the jobs gap,” he said. “It may not look like Edinburgh is suffering in terms of unemployment at the moment. But when you look at the projected jobs demand, it is growing at 1.8 per cent a year while the supply of jobs is growing at just 0.6 per cent a year. So we’re projecting unemployment rates before they happen – rather than reacting when they do happen.”Rising youth unemployment is a particular concern and will be a priority for the council’s strategists. Joblessness among young people is being made worse by the tightening of the labour market – forcing people to accept jobs at a lower scale than their qualifications and experience.“If this is happening at every level, you’re squeezing out the youth because they haven’t got experience,” Mr Buchanan said. “The great thing is that we now know these things at a level of detail and understanding that we didn’t know before.”To tackle youth unemployment, the council is working with partners to launch the “Edinburgh Guarantee” – an initiative to offer a job, training or further education to every child who leaves school in Edinburgh with no future career path. Almost 600 young people a year in Edinburgh currently fall into this category.“We should not tolerate any child leaving school and being allowed to drift into unemployment,” said Mr Buchanan. “Research has shown that young people who are out of work for more than a year find it significantly harder to find employment, and so the costs of supporting them will stay with us for much longer.”Jim Rafferty heads up Capital City Partnership, a collaboration of statutory, voluntary, community and private sector organisations focused on getting people in Edinburgh into work. His biggest worry is that Edinburgh is currently bottom of the league among Scotland’s 32 local authorities in terms of positive destinations – work, training or education – for leavers from state schools.Boosting investment by incoming and indigenous companies has been identified as another vital driver for employment growth. Mr Buchanan said Edinburgh was performing well on this front, with recent investments including Amazon (380 jobs); Primark (600 jobs); Toshiba (100 jobs); State Street (90 jobs); BNY Mellon (60 jobs) and Dell (30 jobs).Edinburgh has attracted 22 foreign direct investment projects in the year to August 2011 compared with 13 in the same period last year and is rated fourth overall in Europe for foreign direct investment – behind Dublin, Dusseldorf and Aberdeen.However, the economic review has highlighted that, while Edinburgh is a natural host to larger companies, smaller companies – which are key drivers of employment growth and typically create 50 per cent of new jobs – are not growing as quickly as they could.To address this, the council and partners, including the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, are calling for improved access to debt and equity finance, as well as launching their own funding initiatives.Greg Ward, the council’s head of economic development, said Edinburgh accounted for 10 per cent of Scotland’s business stock – rising to 25 per cent when the wider city region was included.He said this highlighted the importance of cities as critical drivers of national economic growth. Together, Scotland’s six cities – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling and Inverness – and their regions, account for 90 per cent of Scotland’s population.The review was inspired by the Manchester Independent Economic Review, published in 2009, which was believed to be the first independent economic review of a city region.As budgets tighten, Mr Ward said councils across the UK were taking a much more robust approach to economic development and looking at what impact they could provide over and above traditional statutory functions such as planning.“We need to integrate economic drivers into everything we do,” he said. “In this respect it’s been hugely helpful to have at our fingertips a thorough analysis of the city region’s economy – and it’s given us a very strong motive and real clarity around the need to create job security through investment.”"
384;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-17T16:06:10Z;Asia currencies stay buoyant amid storms;Resilience maintained after global equities collapse;Something unusual happened in Asia over the past month as global equities collapsed – the region’s emerging market currencies held their value against the dollar rather than tumbling as they have traditionally done in the past.While the FTSE All World index of global stocks suffered a double-digit decline amid growing evidence of economic slowdown, JPMorgan’s index of Asian currencies dipped by slightly more than 1 per cent against the dollar before bouncing back strongly.“There was an initial sell-off but, in Asian emerging market currencies, the wobble was marginal at best,” says Simon Derrick, head of FX research at Bank of New York Mellon.He says the resilience in EM currencies reflects the fact that, unlike the financial crisis of 2008, the current turmoil has been caused by fears over sovereign debt and currency debasement in the developed world rather than the health of financial institutions.This means that investors have been pouring money into assets such as gold, which is up nearly 20 per cent in the past month, and pulling funds away from developed markets.“There is only so much gold available to buy and it makes sense to diversify into EM currencies,” says Mr Derrick.Some investors are even starting to regard Asian currencies as the new havens in an increasingly unstable global monetary system.If this view is correct, it heralds a momentous change in the structure of the world economy.Yet most foreign exchange traders remain deeply sceptical about the idea that currencies such as the Korean won, Chinese renminbi and Singapore dollar can be regarded as true havens – even if these currencies have good prospects over the long term.“The belief that Asian currencies are a safe haven is deluded,” says Nick Ferres of Prudential Asset Management in Singapore.“If there was another global recession next year, external demand in Asia would likely collapse and Asian currencies would probably depreciate sharply against the dollar,” he adds.That is certainly the lesson of history. When the global financial crisis began in 2008, Asian currencies plunged against the dollar as trade flows dried up and investors dumped risky assets and fled to the perceived safety of the US.The Korean won, for example, fell more than 40 per cent against the dollar from the start of 2008 to its low in early 2009.Despite an impressive rally over the past two years, the won remains well below its pre-crisis levels.“In a financial crisis, the Asian currency trade won’t work, as money will go into US dollars,” says Mark Matthews, Asia head of research at Julius Baer, the Swiss private bank. “Otherwise, by rule of thumb, Asian currencies will follow China in its gradual appreciation of approximately 4 per cent per year.”Indeed, Asian countries remain just as dependent on exports to the US and Europe as they were in 2008. In the case of Taiwan and Korea, the share of exports as a proportion of gross domestic product has actually increased.The long-awaited “rebalancing” of Asian economies towards domestic demand shows little sign of progress.“If there’s a global crisis, there will be a singular response of economies in Asia as we saw three years ago,” says Dariusz Kowalczyk, Hong Kong-based currency strategist at Crédit Agricole. “The currencies would fall as there would be outflows of portfolio capital, deterioration of current account surpluses and questions about dollar funding.”The exception to the rule is China, which historically tends to peg the renminbi to the dollar in times of stress. China is able to maintain tight control of the renminbi because it restricts the flow of capital in and out of the country and has more than $3,200bn of foreign currency reserves.David Bloom, FX strategist at HSBC, says the Asian currencies most vulnerable to a short-term sell-off in a new financial crisis are those in which positioning is particularly heavy, such as the Singaporean dollar and the Korean won.This month’s decline in equity markets was not accompanied by anything close to the level of financial turmoil and underlying economic weakness seen in 2008.So the recent resilience of Asian currencies says little about how they would behave in a full-blown crisis scenario. The region has been the recipient of vast flows of foreign investment into its equities and bonds in the past two years, thanks to the region’s strong growth rates and lower debt levels than those in the west.Most Asian nations have substantially increased their foreign exchange reserves, giving them additional firepower to fight any currency weakness should foreign investors pull their money from those countries. Government policy will remain a key factor. The central banks of Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia have all intervened in currency markets in recent weeks to prevent their currencies from falling too sharply amid global market volatility.Traditionally, Asian nations have sought to protect their export sectors by preventing their currencies from strengthening.The consequence of holding down their currencies against the dollar has been for Asian nations to accumulate a vast holding of US government debt but many are losing faith in the ability of the US government to preserve the value of those holdings.“In the very long term, Asian countries will probably conclude that they prefer stronger appreciation rather than having to hold all those risky Treasuries,” says Mr Kowalczyk, but in the short term, he adds, the status quo prevails.
385;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-09T21:20:02Z;Gold vaults charge more for storing bullion;;Banks are charging more to store gold after a surge in demand for precious metals has left London, the centre of the global bullion market, short of vault space.Almost all of the major bullion-dealing banks have raised fees since March this year, in some cases more than doubling the rates they charge for vaulting gold, according to clients of the banks and people familiar with the situation.The development is a further sign of how demand for assets which are seen as safe is straining the financial system. Bank of New York Mellon announced last week it would start charging fees on large deposits after a sudden influx of cash.Investors from sophisticated hedge funds to wealthy individuals are turning to gold in an attempt to protect their wealth from the turmoil in financial markets. On Tuesday, the price of bullion surged to a nominal record of $1,778.29 a troy ounce. It has risen 550 per cent in the past decade.HSBC and JPMorgan along with security companies Brink’s and Via Mat operate commercial vaults in London. The Bank of England has a large vault that is primarily geared to providing services for central banks. Other bullion dealers such as Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank and UBS sublet vault space.“People are used to storage being a non-issue,” said Jonathan Spall, director of precious metals sales at Barclays Capital. “But demand for physical gold means that vault space is now at a premium.”Much of the increased demand comes from exchange-traded funds. Investors in ETFs this week boosted their collective gold holdings to about 2,300 tonnes, more than most central banks.HSBC’s London vault holds the gold of the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest gold ETF, while JPMorgan is the custodian for the largest silver ETF, the iShares Silver Trust.“The issue seems to be that London is very close to being out of space,” said a banker at a company that has recently raised rates.Banks charge varying rates for vaulting gold, with large clients such as central banks and hedge funds paying less than retail investors. Fees are typically between 0.03 per cent and 0.15 per cent of the value of the gold held per year.The move to raise vaulting fees began several months ago, when some banks and vaulting companies raised rates. That triggered a chain reaction, as some of those subletting vault space followed suit. Others have recently moved from charging a fee based on the weight of the gold to one determined by its value.In response to the growing strain on the London vaulting system, both Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank are planning to build new vaults.
386;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-07T22:10:03Z;Banks say they had prepared for downgrade;;"The slow death of the US triple A credit rating has given banks time to prepare, bankers claimed over the weekend, though some expected a potentially “messy” start to Monday trading.One banker said there had been “no special meetings; no one returned from the weekend” to discuss Standard & Poor’s announcement on Friday evening. “It’s more the psychological effect on America,” he said.Another said: “There are no emergency meetings but there is a lot of communication going on. We’re checking all the obvious things, like liquidity and customer sentiment, making sure we’re ready for whatever the markets may bring tomorrow.”Washington’s protracted and unruly budget talks left banks planning for a possible US default throughout July. Even when a deal was hatched between Democrats and Republicans to avert that outcome, Wall Street was well aware that a downgrade might still follow.For weeks, banks have been looking to improve their liquidity, hoarding cash and liquid securities to deal with turmoil in the markets. Bankers say the inability of European policymakers to solve their fiscal crisis remains more important than the US downgrade.But there are still unknowns that are haunting bank treasurers and executives. What happens when, as expected on Monday, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental agencies that buy and securitise mortgages, are themselves downgraded?“The question a little bit is whether [Fannie and Freddie are] impacted more than the core Treasury market,” said one. “That will be interesting to see. If they start to bifurcate a little bit, market participants start to think that there’s a preference in the US [to pay Treasuries], things get ugly.”Ira Jersey, strategist at Credit Suisse, said there “may be some forced selling over a month or so” of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie if buyers’ mandates force them to do so. But he added: “On the other side of it, I wouldn’t be completely surprised if some people changed their mandates,” he said. “If you’re a mortgage buyer and you want to own mortgages and those mortgages have to be triple A, where do you go? Your choice is don’t own any mortgages or change your mandate.”The gyrations of the market last week had ancillary effects linked to government policy – such as the decision by Bank of New York Mellon to charge fees on some large deposits to try to reduce its own balance sheet because of the impact on capital ratios and government insurance premiums.It raises questions as to whether the Obama administration or its regulators could intervene in the market or change the rules. “I think they’ve done enough,” said one senior Wall Street executive but at the same time he blamed “a lack of leadership in the White House” for a lot of the current malaise.Banking regulators, whom the banks had criticised for refusing to engage in scenario planning for a default, moved quickly on Friday night to emphasise that they expected the downgrade to have no impact on their assessment of banks’ capital adequacy. Some had suggested that if Treasuries now had a risk premium attached, they should not be deemed risk-free for the purposes of calculating the strength of banks’ balance sheets.Although senior executives might not have been rushing to the office in the weekend, most banks’ analysts were holding conference calls on Sunday with institutional clients, looking to anticipate the market reaction to the downgrade.The $3,000bn repurchase market, which provides short-term financing to banks, is often cited as a vulnerability, given its widespread use of Treasuries as collateral. But Mr Jersey said: “This is a misunderstanding among some who do not know the details of how repo margins and haircuts are calculated. Ratings themselves are irrelevant.” Bankers agreed that because repo markets referenced Treasuries rather than a specific credit rating, the impact should be minimal.S&P indicated there would be further related downgrades to follow on Monday – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy and sell mortgages and issue securities as quasi-government agencies, are almost certain to face a downgrade.Mr Jersey said there “may be some forced selling over a month or so” of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie if buyers’ mandates force them to do so. But he said: “On the other side of it, I wouldn’t be completely surprised if some people changed their mandates,” he said. “If you’re a mortgage buyer and you want to own mortgages and those mortgages have to be AAA, where do you go?” he said. “Your choice is don’t own any mortgages or change your mandate.”Some have questioned whether bank ratings, many of which are already on negative watch, might themselves be reduced.However, one banker said: “Even if there are follow-on downgrades, everyone will stay in place relative to each other.” He added that the fact it was a split rating – with Moody’s and Fitch maintaining their triple A opinion – would help avoid turmoil in the markets."
387;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-07T15:16:48Z;Focus turns to US money market funds;;"US money market funds will be keenly watched by investors and banks this week as they wait to see the reaction to S&P’s long-awaited downgrade of US government debt.The $2,700bn industry plays a crucial role in supplying short-term financing to banks and corporations in the US and around the world, and it was a rush of withdrawals during the crisis in 2008 that sucked vital liquidity from the financial system.The assumption is that money fund owners would again step in to prevent funds “breaking the buck” – allowing a fund valuation to slip below $1 per share – but money market investors have already shown some skittishness vis a vis US government debt problems.In the week to Monday August 1, as legislators in Washington struggled to find a compromise that would allow the $14,300bn debt ceiling to be raised, investors withdrew $122bn from money market funds, according to Crane Data, the second largest weekly drawdown since the Reserve Fund broke the buck in 2008.However, asset inflows returned last week once a new debt ceiling was agreed. The credit quality rating on US short-term paper also remains unchanged, meaning that money market funds do not have to sell assets in response to the downgrade.“The only thing that might jeopardise a fund would be if the downgrade itself led to significant redemptions,” said the head of one money market business.Yet money funds have spent recent months preparing for the risk of investor withdrawals by restricting their lending of very short-term loans and building up cash reserves.“What we learned in 2008 is that liquidity is your maturity and liquidity was critical during that period of volatility,” said Robert Brown, head of Fidelity’s money market business.In response to the financial crisis, new rules were set: restricting the type of securities that money market funds can hold; instituting new requirements on the proportion of assets available to be liquidated in seven days; and requiring funds to publish the details of holdings.“I don’t think anyone thought that some of the financial reforms in Dodd-Frank would be put to the test so soon”, said Jane Buchan, chief executive of Paamco, a $10bn fund of funds.For now, moves by the money market funds to build up available cash levels have already had consequences elsewhere in the financial system.The decision last week by Bank of New York Mellon to charge a fee on cash deposits over $50m came after money funds had parked large funds in bank accounts. The custody banks must pay a fee to insure balances with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Money market funds, historically a key source of short-term wholesale funding for Europe’s banks, have reduced their willingness to lend. The head of one money market business reported that the group’s credit funds were now buying US government paper for the first time since the credit crisis."
388;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Mortgage woes sink BofA shares;;Bank of America, the largest US bank by assets, suffered a second day of sharp share price declines after disclosing that its provisions for compensating buyers of bad mortgages could be inadequate.The bank is embroiled in a complex series of legal actions related to its mortgage units. On Friday, Washington state added to the list, suing BofA for alleged illegal foreclosures. BofA said it was confident that it “operates in compliance” with the law in Washington and declined to comment on broader issues.Shares in BofA fell 66 cents, or 7.5 per cent, to $8.17 after quarterly filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission and separate action from the New York attorney-general on Thursday sparked investor unease about the bank’s overall exposure to refunds.In its SEC filing, BofA said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the “government-sponsored enterprises” which buy and guarantee mortgages, had become more aggressive in negotiating compensation on soured mortgage loans, putting in claims “in numbers that were not expected based on historical claims”.The more aggressive stance comes as Fannie Mae, which was seized by the government in 2008 to prevent its collapse, reported a second-quarter loss of $5.2bn on Friday and requested an additional $5.1bn in funds from the Treasury.As a securitiser of mortgages, BofA makes so-called “representations and warranties” about the quality of the underlying loan portfolio. When homeowners default, Fannie and Freddie, or a private buyer of the mortgages, will look for evidence that the representations and warranties have been breached – and send a claim to BofA.“We have recorded provisions for certain of these exposures and have settled others on a bulk basis,” the bank said in its quarterly filing. “However, the ultimate resolution of these exposures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.”BofA, led by chief executive Brian Moynihan, is struggling to put the issue behind it. In one such effort, it agreed in June to pay $8.5bn to investors in certain mortgage-backed securities in a deal brokered with Bank of New York Mellon, trustee to the investors.But on Thursday, Eric Schneiderman, New York attorney-general, filed papers in the state supreme court trying to overturn the settlement and accusing BNY Mellon of conflicts of interest because it would be indemnified by BofA for any other legal claims related to the portfolio. BNY Mellon called Mr Schneiderman’s filing, in which he also accused the trustee bank of fraud, “outrageous”. BofA said in its filing that it would expect to incur increased costs if the settlement were not approved by a judge.BofA is separately trying to reach a settlement with all 50 state attorneys-general and the Department of Justice. Some enforcement officials are reluctant to sign up to a settlement that would prevent them from taking the sort of action launched this week in Washington state and New York.“We have previously disclosed that GSE [government sponsored enterprise] behaviour is evolving in a way that diverges from our longstanding course of dealing with them,” said a BofA spokesman. “Our estimate of the liability for these obligations has been accounted for in the recorded liability for representations and warranties. We have taken into account and will continue to closely monitor and assess the possible future risk associated with these changed behaviours.”
389;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-05T16:56:43Z;Lenders review charges amid cash influx;;The quest for safe assets stepped up as more banks reviewed charging for deposits, the Swiss central bank mooted action to halt a rise in the country’s currency and analysts warned that money market funds can expect to be savaged by hedge funds in US Treasury auctions.Jill King, partner at Horizon Cash Management, said on Friday that there was a “major flight into any short asset available. There is no place to go because we continued to see a lack of assets to meet the demand for short money.”As fear stalked the markets this week, banks said they were experiencing an influx of cash. JPMorgan analysts estimate that bank deposits have surged by more than $500bn in the past 12 months to about $4,600bn, with a sharp increase in the past week.Unusually, they were not happy about it. On Thursday, Bank of New York Mellon started charging to hold large cash deposits. With short-term Treasury bills also offering negative yields, it is increasingly difficult not only to earn a return – but to avoid making a loss.BNY Mellon’s move, which applies only for certain accounts with an average balance of more than $50m, was made in response to what it called a “sudden” and “significant” influx of cash. Other banks, who declined to speak publicly, said they were reviewing their rates.From the point of view of money market mutual funds and others that have large amounts of cash to protect, banks are attractive because their non-interest bearing accounts are insured to an unlimited level by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.But the banks have to pay premiums to the FDIC as a percentage of assets, which are swollen temporarily but substantially along with the increased liabilities of the deposits.If they then park their own money at the Federal Reserve, for a meagre 25 basis point interest rate, they make little or no return. As balance sheets swell, not only do the FDIC premiums increase but banks are supposed to hold more capital.Short-term US Treasury bills are also no longer the protection they were. With yields on short-dated Treasuries in negative territory, there could be a “messy” knock-on effect at the next auction, analysts at Credit Suisse warned.Since the Treasury cannot issue bills with a negative yield, the auction would not be decided on price – everyone would bid zero – but on volume. Hedge funds, who are able to use debt to leverage the size of their bids, could snap up the supply.“Presumably, cash investors, such as the money market mutual funds that most desperately need Treasury bills, will not be able to play this game because of the risk of being awarded more than they need,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote. The result, they predicted, will be hedge funds sell on the bills in the secondary market to the money market mutual funds, putting them under further pressure.Signs of growing tension have also been evident in Europe. Philipp Hildebrand, president of the Swiss National Bank said policymakers would not rule out “further measures” to halt the rise of the franc, which rose to a record 75.79 centimes against the US dollar on Friday.In the eurozone, the use of the European Central Bank’s overnight deposit facility has doubled in the past week to €117.8bn ($168bn) from €49.9bn last Friday. The facility usually pays less than market rates, suggesting that banks prefer to hoard funds rather than put them to work in the interbank markets.Bankers said the key test would come in September when the bond markets reopened after their summer lull. Turmoil before the summer had meant that only the strongest banks had been able to tap the long-term funding available, leaving some treasurers potentially behind with their borrowing plans for the year.
390;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-05T12:35:32Z;Yen and Swiss franc in demand;;Rising concerns over the global financial system pushed the Swiss franc and the yen up to record levels this week, prompting action from the central banks in Switzerland and Japan to rein in their currencies.Worries over the contagion from the eurozone debt crisis rattled investors, combining with fears over global growth to send equities sharply lower and to boost haven demand for the yen and the Swiss franc.The yen rose to a four-month high on Tuesday of Y76.29 against the dollar, just shy of the record peak of Y76.25 that it hit in March, while the Swiss franc hit a record peak of SFr0.7608 against the dollar.The moves provoked reactions from the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan.The SNB cut interest rates and flooded the money market with liquidity on Wednesday in a bid to weaken the franc.Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Bank of Japan, under instruction from the Ministry of Finance, intervened and sold, according to some traders, up to Y4,000bn to stem the yen’s advance.Both central banks met with some initial success with the Swiss franc falling on Wednesday and the yen dropping below Y80 against the dollar on Thursday.But the effect soon faded with analysts warning that unilateral intervention from Japan or Switzerland was unlikely to have a lasting effect, given that the source of demand for their currencies was beyond the control of domestic policymakers.“It would take a substantial shift in expectations over global growth and a significant easing in eurozne debt tensions to produce a meaningful fall in demand for either the yen or the Swiss franc,” said Simon Derrick, of Bank of New York Mellon.Over the week, the yen fell 2.2 per cent to Y78.45 against the dollar and was down 0.8 per cent to Y111.42 against the euro.Efforts to contain strength in the Swiss franc were less successful with currency continuing to climb to record highs against the dollar and the euro even after the SNB’s action.Over the week, the Swiss franc climbed 3.2 per cent to SFr0.7595 against the dollar and rose 4.6 per cent to SFr1.0784 against the euro.The euro dropped 1.4 per cent to $1.4192 against the dollar as continuing tension in eurozone financial markets prompted the European Central Bank to ease its monetary policy stance and extend its liquidity operations.Commodity-linked currencies were hardest hit by fears over global growth. The Australian dollar dropped 4.8 per cent to $1.0455 against the US dollar on the week.
391;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-08-04T22:25:37Z;Equities plunge: perspective is in order;There was nothing on per se that should have sparked a sell-off;Had someone told a stock trader nine months ago that the Dow Jones Industrials would be at the same level today, he or she would likely have struggled to draw much of a conclusion about what that implied for the economy. A pause for breath might be perfectly natural after shares had rallied 18 per cent in the preceding five months and nearly doubled since the March 2009 low. But, psychologically at least, the order in which things occur makes a huge difference. The fact that the index is back to that early December level after a 512 point plunge – the worst since 2008, dropping nine days out of the last 10 – has spurred talk of a double-dip recession or worse.There were signals in recent days and weeks that global growth may be slowing but nothing on Thursday morning per se that should have sparked a sell-off. Indeed, the ADP employment report was benign. Instead, markets across different asset classes, more interconnected than ever – particularly so on such extreme days – are feeding off of one another. Weakness in Spanish and Italian bonds, strength in safe havens or a surge in the volatility implied in options prices all suggest that other traders knew something. Selling begat more selling on Thursday in what seemed an indiscriminate rush for liquidity.Only three stocks in the S&P 500 rose and Bank of New York Mellon announced that it had received so many cash deposits that it has begun charging some clients rather than paying interest. Even gold, the go-to asset during market unease recently, fell a bit. Some perspective is in order. If one was comfortable making a long-term bet on stocks back in December, much less at the April peak, then there is little reason to feel differently today unless fundamentals have changed. The likelihood that billions will be pulled out of stock funds just illustrates that the stock market is the only one in the world where customers run away during a sale.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
392;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BNY Mellon to charge on $50m-plus deposits;Reponse to ‘sudden’ rise in cash holdings;Bank of New York Mellon said it would start charging a fee on large deposits in response to a “sudden” and “significant” increase in its balance sheet from investors searching for a haven to stash their cash.Accounts with an average deposit of more than $50m will be charged a 13 basis point annual fee on the excess and an additional fee if short-term Treasury bills produce negative yields. On Thursday, yields on one-month Treasury bills dipped as low as -0.0102, their lowest level since January last year, in turbulent financial markets across the world.Banks have seen an influx of cash deposits in recent weeks as the US Congress and White House struggled to reach agreement on an increase to the country’s debt ceiling. Regulators assured them that they would look sympathetically on any temporary breach of capital ratios.But BNY Mellon said in a letter to clients that the “extraordinary deposits” meant that fees were necessary to safeguard the “quality and strength” of its balance sheet. Separately, it said that only a small number of clients with “extraordinary” levels of cash would be affected.“The transient nature of these new deposits prevents us from investing our balance sheet to cover the costs from regulatory ratios and deposit insurance,” the bank said. Other banks said they were watching the move but none immediately said it would follow suit.“It’s adding additional concern and uncertainty into the markets, already concerned about weakening economic growth and the lack of ability for fiscal and monetary policy to respond,” said Michael Pond, interest rate strategist at Barclays Capital.Some money market fund providers welcomed the move, which, if adopted across the banking industry, would lessen the chance of a run on deposits due to the simple lack of alternatives for holders of cash. “It should help prevent future imbalances,” said Peter Crane of Crane Data, “Money rushing from one segment to another has unintended consequences and can be destabilising,” he added.But Scott Skyrm, global head of money markets and repo at Newedge, said “a massive amount of cash entered the repo market today”, estimating the flow at $100bn-$300bn. He said that BNY Mellon’s move would add further pressure to rates. “Rates can now go [negative] and cash investors will still invest,” he said.The $2,700bn money market industry in recent weeks placed large amounts of cash with the custody banks as they prepared for the potential consequences of a failure by politicians to raise the debt ceiling.Chastened by the experience of the financial crisis, when money market funds suffered a rush of withdrawals from institutional investors and corporations, the industry avoided specific short-term government debt securities and built cash reserves to meet redemptions.BNY Mellon warned, in a statement to the Financial Times, that “the vast majority of clients will not be affected” by the fee, meant only to be applied to clients whose “deposits have increased significantly in recent weeks, well above market trends”.In the week to August 1, investors withdrew $122bn from money market funds, according to Crane Data, but inflows have started to return since the debt ceiling was raised on Tuesday.Treasury bills have been squeezed by both a reduction in supply and an increase in demand this year. On the supply side, the Treasury has concentrated on bond issues to extend the overall maturity of US debt, while a programme that issued $200bn in extra short-term bills was run down because of the debt limit.On the demand side, regulatory changes have spurred banks to hold more of the safest and most liquid assets, such as Treasury bills, adding to downward pressure on short-term interest rates. That has left other investors, such as money market funds, struggling for places where they can park short-term cash and still earn a yield.“This will push all the cash sitting on the sidelines into short-term instruments, making collateral such as Treasuries more expensive,” said Christian Cooper, head of dollar derivatives at Jefferies.An auction of $20bn of 10-day bills by the US Treasury yielded zero per cent, the third straight such auction that has seen a zero yield. The rush for safe alternatives to cash has pushed interest rates broadly lower. The yield on the two-year US Treasury note hit an all-time low of 0.25 per cent, and the 10-year note yield fell below 2.5 per cent for the first time this year.
393;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-07-31T13:00:36Z;A ‘smart move’ in the current environment;The secondary loans asset class is increasingly popular;Leading secondary loan market fund managers are seeing strong growth in assets, despite investment consultants going cold on the asset class.Secondary loans are being marketed as having equity-like returns, but with less volatility and higher security. This has led to some leading European loan funds seeing assets under management rise by 75-100 per cent in the past 12 months.This is despite the pricing of higher quality secondary loans rising to 98-99 per cent of face value, after falling to a low of around 60 per cent in early 2009.Secondary loans are those sold on by their original issuers. The underlying debt is often that issued to fund leveraged buyouts by private equity groups. It typically pays a floating rate of several percentage points above Libor or Euribor, giving it diversification benefits with respect to traditional fixed income investments, such as corporate bonds.Fund managers attribute the growth in demand to new awareness by first-time investors, to new opportunities presented by rising market interest rates, and a drive to avoid higher inflation.Alcentra, whose investors include leading Scandinavian and UK pension funds, has seen the value of its unleveraged European loan fund, one of the biggest in the market, double to €220m in the past year.“Having something that is an inflation hedge and taking some money out of fixed income [debt] into floating rate feels like a smart move in the current economic environment”, said Graham Rainbow, European loan portfolio manager at Alcentra, a boutique within the BNY Mellon empire.“You also have the ability to renegotiate terms or ultimately go to the courts and take the keys to the business. Most high-yield bonds do not have financial covenants.”The Lombard Odier 1798 European loan fund, run on a long/short basis, has also seen assets soar since launch in July 2009 to $150m, with a 75 per cent rise in the past 12 months. Its two-year return is 27 per cent.Elvis Pellumbi, the fund’s London-based portfolio manager, is hoping to cap the fund at between $400m and $500m next summerHe says part of the demand comes from investors who are aware that the secondary loan market has often performed well in recessions. Much of the issuance comes from leveraged buy-outs such as those of Alliance Boots and Ineos, or investment-grade companies that have made what he euphemistically calls “mistakes with their capital structure”.“It is a very interesting asset space,” says Mr Pellumbi. “You have security and you have a covenant. And you have the power of pricing. There is a right price for a bad asset, hardly ever is it worth zero. So if you buy it at the right price then the returns are quite attractive.”The development of a secondary loan market in Europe is a relatively recent phenomenon, having started from a low base around 10 years ago, he adds. In contrast, the US market is bigger and has been around for longer.However, investment consultants are no longer pushing the asset class to their clients due to concerns about the narrowing of spreads over Libor and potential liquidity risk in the event of another economic crisis.Paul Cavalier, partner and fixed income research manager at Mercer, says the only value in loans now is in their floating rate attributes.Phil Page, client manager at Cardano, a pension fund consultant, says: “The party is largely over for high-quality bank loans. Our clients invested heavily in 2009 and made a 30 per cent return before exiting in late 2009.”Mr Page says the price of these loans is now much closer to their historical average, which limits its potential. “There are still some opportunities in distressed bank loans, but this requires an experienced and skilful manager”, he said.David Milward, head of loans at Henderson, which has seen assets under management rise 40 per cent in the past 12 months, has responses to some of these objections.He admits that overall market volumes have declined as investors entered the market in early 2009 and then exited soon after. “The market today continues to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns”, he said. Banks remain cautious when arranging new transactions and thus new issues are more conservatively structured and pay significantly higher returns than we have seen historically.“Given capital constraints on banks and a stagnant CLO [collateralised loan obligation] market in Europe, we expect this improved risk reward profile in the asset class to be ongoing.”
394;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-07-25T21:44:42Z;Relief rally for risk assets comes to a halt;;Sovereign default fears soured investor sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic as Moody’s downgraded Greek debt and political paralysis gripped Washington amid wrangling over the US debt ceiling.The relief rally for risk assets that had buoyed markets towards the end of last week came to an abrupt halt as global stocks sold off for the first time in five sessions and benchmark Treasury yields briefly pushed back above 3 per cent.“Last Thursday afternoon, financial markets were basking in the promise of resolution to the world’s two major debt crises,” said Neil Mellor of Bank of New York Mellon.“However, the eurozone’s quest for stability remains strewn with hurdles and, once again, investors must face up to the genuine possibility that the world’s largest economy may default on its debt.”Gold surged to a nominal record high while the Swiss franc jumped to an all-time high against the US dollar as investors sought havens.“It will be a jittery week for the markets,” added Kathleen Brooks of Forex.com. “Although it seems like an Armageddon-like scenario to think what would happen if the US defaults, gold would benefit along with the Swiss franc.”The consequences of a US default for global markets would be far more “dangerous” than a one or two-notch downgrade for the US credit rating, said Julian Jessop of Capital Economics – hence why such a scenario remained unlikely.“If the [August 2] deadline does pass without agreement, the US Treasury would almost certainly decide to service debt for as long as possible and focus on making savings elsewhere. It would be astonishing if the Treasury did not have some further contingency plans to prevent or at least delay a default.”In the government bond markets, the decision by Moody’s to cut Greece by three notches to Ca accelerated a trend of contagion fears already evident amid last week’s relief rally.“It was on Friday that peripheral spreads showed early signs of fatigue,” said Divyang Shah of IFR Markets. “The post-European Union summit party did not last for as long as most would have hoped for.”He noted that Italian and Spanish 10-year bond yields moved more dramatically on Monday than Europe’s trio of bailed-out nations. “This is significant and suggests that, while many will have hoped for quiet weeks during summer, the markets might look to test the European financial stability facility’s pre-emptive crisis-fighting toolkit.“Safe-haven and yield-searching investors continue to look for the exit on Italy and Spain – the crisis continues,” Mr Shah added.Spanish 10-year yields climbed 25 basis points to 6.04 per cent while Italy’s jumped 27bp to 5.67 per cent – Greece’s rose just 17bp. Bunds fell 5bp to 2.77 per cent on haven flows.Ten-year Treasury yields reached an intraday high of 3.03 per cent but US debt was resilient in the face of political uncertainty and $99bn of sales this week, paring losses with yields up 4bp to 3 per cent. Yields on 30-year bonds had earlier reached last week’s high of 4.34 per cent.In the currency markets, the dollar lost out to the Swiss franc as the favoured haven, slipping 1.7 per cent.“With all this uncertainty, the Swiss franc has gone on a further tear, being the best gainer of the day and hitting new highs against the dollar,” said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets.The yen also gained against the dollar and euro, threatening a return to below the pre-intervention levels of earlier this year.In the equity markets, the FTSE All World index fell 0.5 per cent to register its first retreat for a week. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 slipped 0.4 per cent with the S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent.In the commodities markets, gold set its fifth nominal all-time high in nine sessions of $1,622.49 per ounce before later trimming gains at $1,615 per ounce.

Denver-based Alps would give DST an entry into both ETF servicing as well as ETF management.Alps has become one of the fastest-growing ETF providers, with $1.49bn in assets, ranking 22nd among other US providers. In this year’s first half, it garnered $650m in inflows, compared with just $42m a year earlier. Its rainmaker is the $1.2bn Alps Alerian MLP ETF launched last August, which is responsible for nearly $600m of this year’s inflows.Alps Holdings, which specialises in asset services and asset gathering for funds, would continue to operate under the Alps brand while being merged into a newly formed DST subsidiary.A DST spokeswoman said the company was not commenting on the deal announcement.The deal marks the fifth announced in three months by DST, which itself has been deflecting takeover talk. Its shares have slumped to the mid-$50s, from around $83 in 2007, amid a business slowdown linked to the financial crisis and competition from Bank of New York Mellon, as well as the ETF assault. Its portfolio of mutual fund accounts shrank by 6.1 per cent last year, to 113.7m accounts, prompting lay-offs of 7 per cent of its workforce.DST management acknowledged last month having received buy-out queries but denied being engaged in sale talks, saying its stock price was too undervalued. A week ago, shareholder RDG Capital organised a gathering of about 20 of DST’s biggest shareholders to discuss their options.Alps has been majority-owned since September 2005 by private equity firm Lovell Minnick Partners, which paid an undisclosed amount for the stake.
396;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-07-19T14:21:03Z;BNY Mellon gains on European uncertainty;;Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank by assets, reported growth in earnings for the second quarter on rising assets under management and highlighted the opportunity created by uncertainty in Europe’s banking system.Net income for the New York-based bank rose 8 per cent to $735m from the same period last year. Revenues of $3.06bn were up 15 per cent on the year before, but BNY Mellon reported non-interest expenses up 21 per cent as the company integrated acquisitions, such as last year’s $2.31bn deal to buy PNC Financial Services’ global-investment services business, and faced significant litigation costs.“Expense growth remained high due in part to legal and regulatory costs. We are taking additional actions to reduce expenses,” said Robert Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer.Mr Kelly sought to play down a series of ongoing law suits and investigations into foreign exchange practices at BNY Mellon and peer State Street launched by attorneys-general in several states related to transaction charges paid by state pension funds.“The related business represents less than one half of 1 per cent of our revenues,” he said. The bank maintains that its pricing practices were fair, based on contractual agreements and that customers always had the option to negotiate trades directly.Very low short term interest rates remained a drag on earnings, with fee waivers on money market funds as interest rates approach zero costing the bank $60m to $65m in the quarter. However, Mr Kelly attributed a $32bn gain in long-term assets to the uncertainty in Europe.He also attempted to reassure analysts that the $34bn of European assets held in the firm’s prime money market funds are not at risk from the sovereign debt crisis, with only one in five of the European banks passing BNY Mellon’s credit assessment and bank debt representing 28 per cent of the European assets.“We have a really good opportunity to gain market share in Europe,” Mr Kelly said. Acquisitions may not be available in the next two or three years, he said, but added, “there is a pretty long list of opportunities here. The question is how quick and aggressive the banks and financial institutions want to act to free up capital and realign their businesses”.BNY Mellon shares were up 1.5 per cent at $25 per share in early New York trading.
397;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-07-14T16:27:05Z;Unpredictable extremes of politics pose the real risk;Answers vary wildly to question of probability of technical US default;"What is the probability of the US government tipping into technical default on August 2, because politicians fail to agree a deal to raise the ceiling on debt issuance? That is the $14,290bn question, following Moody’s decision on Wednesday to put its top-notch Aaa rating on the US on notice for a downgrade.The answers vary wildly. If you look at the Intrade online prediction market – the arena for placing political cyber bets – traders currently think there is a 60 per cent chance that no deal will be cut by the end of July. Most Wall Street banks, however, put it far lower. Standish, the Bank of New York Mellon Asset Management unit, for example, reckons the chance of a crisis on August 2 to be a “tail” risk of about 10 per cent. Meanwhile, movements in the Treasuries market imply that the danger of default is negligible: on Thursday the 10-year bond was trading with a yield of about 2.92 per cent, just above this year’s lows.But if you spend any time listening to Washington politicians, it seems that the risks are significant – and rising. This week I talked to members of Congress from both parties, and to me it seems that positions are hardening in a way that could make it tough to cut any deal. Hence Moody’s move; it now thinks default risk is “low but no longer de minimus”.So what explains this divergence? Part of the problem is that predicting the fiscal future is becoming particularly hard. A few years ago, traders generally assumed that forecasts could be made by plugging numbers into a spreadsheet. But the key variables now lie in the unfamiliar, unquantifiable realms of political science and psychology, and the scenarios look dangerously binary – in both the US and the eurozone.Another problem is that while Washington and Wall Street look geographically close on the map, the communities seem planets apart in cognitive terms. Call it, if you like, a problem of mutual complacency. Up on Wall Street, most financiers have been blithely confident (at least until recently) that a debt deal would be struck before August 2, partly because they could not imagine politicians would be stupid enough to refuse this.After all, to anybody who is close to the markets, it seems self-evident that even a “temporary”, technical default would risk creating turmoil for bond yields, and tipping core parts of the financial system – such as the repurchase market– into shock, if not gridlock. Thus most investors have assumed that the drama in Washington was just the “usual” type of brinkmanship that has often occurred before in American politics. Eventually, it was argued, a deal would be cut to avert disaster – as it was with the 2010 budget this year.However, in Washington, a different type of complacency has been afoot. A significant chunk of the Republican Party does not accept the need to stick to an August 2 deadline. That is partly because they think the government can continue to pay its coupon on outstanding bonds, even if it runs out of money (as the Treasury claims it will do after August 2). Thus, their argument goes, there is not any real risk of “default” at all.Moreover, even if a brief technical default occurred, some Republicans say, there should be sufficient demand for Treasury bonds to keep yields low, because many institutions have to keep buying Treasuries, no matter what.After all, they argue, just look at what has happened to yields in recent weeks; there is no need to fear markets. Or, as one Republican argues: “Just agreeing to create $2,000bn more debt for our grandchildren would be a sin . . . We don’t need to rush to a bad deal.”Now this emphatically is not the only view around. Some senior Republican leaders are profoundly worried about the potential economic and political consequences of failing to cut a deal. Hence the “get out” plan that was advanced by Mitch McConnell, Republican Senate leader, this week, and the attempts by some politicians on both sides to broker rhetorical compromises (such as focusing on expanding the tax base, rather than raising rates, or cutting short-term deals). And on balance, I suspect the most likely scenario for the next month is that some type of McConnell-style fudge wins the day – or, more accurately, a few more months of time.But while I give a “fudge” outcome a 60 per cent probability, it is the unpredictable extremes of politics that now pose the real risk, in Washington as in the eurozone. Little wonder, then, that Moody’s acted this week; nor is it any surprise that it (like other rating agencies) did not change its stance on US companies. What is going on now is a problem of political governance, not just economics.In that sense, then, the art of predicting the path of rich “developed” market debt is starting to feel more and more like the “emerging” market world. It is an irony indeed.gillian.tett@ft.com"
398;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-07-13T17:31:18Z;US ETF assets to double to $2,000bn by 2015;Non-traditional asset classes expected to win a larger market share;The US exchange traded funds industry will see assets double to $2,000bn before the end of 2015 with non-traditional ETFs winning a growing share of the market, according to a report from BNY Mellon, the financial services company, and Strategic Insight, a research consultancy.”The next wave of growth for ETFs is being driven by new asset classes, new indexes and new ways of using ETFs as tools for portfolio construction,” said Joseph Keenan, head of global ETF services at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.Loren Fox, senior research analyst at Strategic Insight and an author of the report, said investors were increasingly open to using ETFs because traditional asset allocation models had lost much of their appeal in the wake of the global financial crisis.He added that ETFs were helping to blur the distinction between alpha (active management) and beta (passive management) and it was likely that investors would increasingly seek active or quasi-active ETFs.“Varieties of ETF usage are mushrooming,” said Mr Fox.He noted that growing numbers of retail investors were adopting the “barbell” strategies used by institutions. ETFs could provide inexpensive beta (market) exposures but they were also being increasingly used to access advanced strategies or alternative asset classes such as hedge funds.“The proliferation of ETFs challenges the traditional demarcation between alpha and beta. Is an actively managed portfolio of ETFs aiming to generate alpha or beta?”Mr Fox said most investors were ambivalent in response to this question and instead preferred to focus on wealth creation, risk management and liquidity in an ever more complex investment environment.He also noted that investors were willing to pay more for innovative products that offered the possibility of greater returns or reduced volatility. So while it was possible to buy a “vanilla” ETF tracking the S&P 500 for as little as 6 basis points, more providers were launching premium priced products that went beyond tracking a well known index. Across the 15 most popular new ETFs launched over the past year, the average expense ratio was 64 basis points. Those popular new ETFs were dominated by alternative asset classes such as emerging market debt or commodities such as silver or rare earths.ETF penetration of the US marketplace remains at an early stage. The research showed only 5 per cent of households that owned mutual funds also owned ETFs but their usage is increasing among Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) and financial advisers at broker dealers.Strategic Insight found that financial advisers were much more inclined to use ETFs in discretionary accounts where they did not have to persuade investors of the merits of ETFs.Mr Fox said that the $4,500bn defined contribution pension plans market remained a “tantalising challenge” for ETF providers as DC platforms were operationally structured to deal with mutual funds.He added that the biggest challenge for the ETF industry’s growth was not the structure of particular markets but a lack of understanding of ETFs among investors and how they worked.
399;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-07-13T12:28:40Z;Gulf banks want regional regulation of bonds;;The Gulf Bonds and Sukuk Association trade body is calling for the harmonisation of regulatory procedures governing tradeable debt issues across the region.The GBSA, which represents several investment banking industry players and which lobbies governments and capital market authorities, wants to see a “one regulator”, European Union-type framework to speed up what it says is a lengthy issuance process.“There are certain obstacles across the Gulf: you don’t have a consistent approach in domestic regulation on how to issue bonds,” says Michael Grifferty, president of the GBSA. “There is a process going on that should lead to consistent and streamlined issuance procedures that, in turn, would bring down the cost of issuance.”Debt issuance has been popular, certainly compared with share issues. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) bond and sukuk issuance was more than 10 times the size of primary market equity launches in both 2009 and 2010, at $44bn and $40bn respectively, while $141bn of tradeable debt has been issued since 2007 compared with only $49bn in equity initial public offerings, according to Deutsche Bank data.“This year, my expectation is for [bond] issuance close to or above last year’s level. There is an opportunity, given current rates and a compelling pricing argument,” says Salman al-Khalifa, Deutsche Bank’s head of markets in the MENA region.When it comes to Islamic bonds, or sukuk, Mr Khalifa says issue structure is becoming less important. Conventional investors look at the underlying economics of Islamic instruments, not necessarily the structure, he says. “The Islamic and conventional bond market have by and large come a lot closer.”He says that local currency issuance is increasingly significant. He views the approximate sum of $50bn of capital in the Saudi banks as limiting their ability to make further loans and as insufficient to drive current growth rates. The borrowing requirements of the Saudi economy will mean locally denominated bonds will play a larger role.Giambattista Atzeni, vice-president at BNY Mellon and a GBSA committee member, says the 2009 Dubai financial crisis provided a strong incentive to develop the region’s debt markets, forcing an improvement in issuer due diligence and refining the stories being told to international investors.Only a tiny fraction of lending was in debt capital markets before Dubai’s debt standstill, he says, with bank finance predominating. Because bank lending tended to be short-term, most borrowers needed to refinance often. “Borrowers slowly realised that one of the most efficient ways to raise finance was through the debt capital markets,” he says.The International Petroleum Investment Corporation, an Abu Dhabi government-related entity, with more than $4bn in issuance in the past 18 months, and Emirates airline, which closed a $1bn bond in June, have blazed a trail.More co-ordination is needed at government level, Mr Atzeni says, to prevent issuers coming to market at the same time. “The market wants to grow, the market wants to develop. A lot of things need to be done. But it’s up to us, to the market, to make that happen.”
400;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;New York attorney-general probes BofA settlement;;New York’s attorney-general sent letters to 20 investment managers, including BlackRock Financial Management and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, seeking information about an $8.5bn settlement Bank of America struck last month with large bond investors, according to copies of the letters obtained by the Financial Times.Eric Schneiderman, the attorney-general, has been investigating Wall Street banks over how they packaged and sold mortgage-backed securities before the collapse of the housing market. The letters, dated July 7, said his office is seeking information about the BofA settlement in connection with its ongoing investigation into the securitisation of residential mortgages.Mr. Schneiderman’s office requested the asset managers provide information by July 14, including the names of investors in the securities covered by the settlement, as well as the par amount and current market value of those investments.BofA last month reached a deal to settle allegations made by 22 large bond investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock, MetLife and Freddie Mac, that loans made by its Countrywide Financial unit failed to meet underwriting guidelines and that the lender, which was bought by BofA in 2008, failed to properly service the loans once they were packaged and sold.A group of bond investors who were not part of the settlement said in court documents last week that they planned to challenge the agreement on the grounds that Bank of New York Mellon, which was party to the deal as the trustee on the bonds in question, had conflicts of interests that raised questions about its fairness.BofA and BNY Mellon declined to comment.BofA has been moving to resolve claims related to how it underwrote, packaged and sold mortgages leading up the housing collapse.The bank reached an agreement on Monday with MBIA under which the large bond insurer will drop a lawsuit that accused BofA’s Merrill Lynch investment bank of misrepresenting the quality of mortgage-backed securities for which the insurer underwrote $5.7bn in protection against default.The agreement to drop the suit is the first significant move by MBIA and BofA to begin sorting through a tangle of cross-litigation that has ensnared the two companies since the housing market collapsed.A filing with the New York State Supreme Court said that in agreeing to dismiss all “claims, counterclaims and cross-claims”, each party would bear the cost of their respective legal fees.MBIA continues to press two separate lawsuits against Bank of American and its Countrywide Financial unit over the quality of loans underwritten by those institutions.BofA has meanwhile joined a group of 15 large banks and financial firms suing MBIA, claiming that the bond insurer reduced its ability to pay policyholders by splitting its business in two when it restructured in 2009.MBIA sued Merrill Lynch in April 2009, about seven months after BofA agreed to buy the investment bank. In its suit, MBIA accused Merrill Lynch of misrepresenting the quality of the securities for which an MBIA unit, LaCrosse Financial, underwrote credit insurance. Although Merrill said the quality of the securities was triple A, the bank knew that the credit quality was far below that level, according to the complaint.As a result, MBIA said it wound up owing several hundred million dollars to cover losses.A state judge threw out all but one claim last year, and in February, a New York appeals court dismissed the entire case on the grounds that MBIA’s level of sophistication would have made it difficult for the insurer to prove that Merrill Lynch had committed fraud.MBIA filed a motion to appeal the ruling, but no decision had been made on it before Monday’s agreement by both parties to dismiss the case.MBIA and BofA declined to comment.The other firms contacted by the New York attorney-general were Aegon USA Investment Management, Bayerische Landesbank, ING Investment Management, ING Bank, ING Capital, Invesco Advisors, Kore Advisors, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, MetLife, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Neuberger Berman Europe, New York Life Investment Management, Pacific Investment Management, Prudential Investment Management, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, Trust Company of the West and Western Asset Management.The firms declined to comment, were unavailable to comment or said they had not received the letter.
401;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-07-05T21:14:30Z;Bond investors challenge $8.5bn BofA settlement;Walnut group raises questions about deal fairness;A group of bond investors plans to challenge an $8.5bn deal that Bank of America struck last week with other investors to settle mis-selling claims over mortgage-backed securities sold by its Countrywide Financial unit.The group, which calls itself Walnut Place, has accused Bank of New York Mellon, BofA’s trustee on the securitisations, of having conflicts of interest that raise questions about the fairness of the deal, according to a court filing.The Walnut Place investors own more than one-quarter of the voting rights in one Countrywide trust and unspecified shares in two others, the court documents said.Bank of America last week reached a deal to settle allegations made by 22 large bond investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock, MetLife and Freddie Mac, that Countrywide loans failed to meet underwriting guidelines and that the lender, which was bought by BofA in 2008, failed to properly service the loans once they were packaged and sold.The Walnut Place investors were not part of that settlement, although they had made similar claims in a lawsuit filed in March.The court filing made on Tuesday accused BNY Mellon of failing as trustee in multiple ways, especially in not forcing Countrywide to buy back faulty home loans but also because it put its own interests ahead of shareholders in the trusts when it took part in negotiations for the deal reached last week with the 22 investors.The Walnut Place investors said that as many as two-thirds of the loans in two Countrywide trusts failed to meet underwriting guidelines, according to their own investigation.Extrapolating that failure rate to the 530 trusts covered by the bank’s settlement, the Walnut Place investors concluded that BofA could be liable to repurchase loans with unpaid principal balances of as much as $242bn.“The $8.5bn that Countrywide and BofA have agreed to pay is therefore only a small fraction of the potential liability that they would have faced in litigation on behalf of the trusts,” the Walnut Place investors argued in the court documents.BNY Mellon declined to comment on Walnut Place’s claims, but said, “As trustee, we acted and continue to act in the best interests of all investors in the trusts.” A BofA spokesman said, “The settlement agreement was designed to give certificate holders, like those behind the Walnut Place entities, an opportunity to have any objections heard.”As part of the settlement, BNY Mellon negotiated a larger indemnity from Countrywide for costs and liabilities related to servicing the trusts than it would have otherwise received as well as a guarantee from BofA that puts BNY Mellon “in a substantially better position than it was in before negotiating the proposed settlement, at the direct expense of the certificate holders whose interests [BNY Mellon] purports to protect,” the court papers said.
402;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Bank plans will help Singapore be leading fund centre;There have been calls for Singapore to instate a more flexible fund structure;Last month, Singapore’s financial market regulator and central banking authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), reiterated its intentions of strengthening the city-state’s fund administration services. Unsurprising, perhaps, but a further indication of the regulator’s committment to making the Lion City Asia’s leading fund centre.Pragmatic regulation, including exempt licensing provisions for smaller managers, has largely been applauded by the investment community and has helped Singapore extend the depth and diversity of local and global fund managers operating there.“This [fund administration initiative] is a multi-year and multi-phased plan of MAS to position Singapore as the leading fund management hub for Asia-Pacific,” says Chong Jin Leow of BNY Mellon. The regulator has for a long time courted administrators, he says, and should be commended for transforming an industry that five years ago only had around four dominant administrators, three of which were bank subsidiaries.Currently, roughly half the funds sold in Singapore are Dublin and Luxembourg-domiciled Ucits funds, but few if any are administered there.Han Ming Ho, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance, says: “Plan 2.0 for MAS now is to think about how to bring the funds themselves to Singapore. We’ve always known MAS has been supportive of strengthening the infrastructure. Part of this would include service providers, including administrators.”Nick Wright, chief operating officer at State Street Global Services, adds: “If Singapore is successful in building itself out as a fund domicile I think fund administration will logically grow from that.”Mr Ho points out that MAS had previously called for hedge fund administrators to set up in the city, “and I think we now have more than 30 administrators here”.According to the regulator, fund administrators find Singapore an ideal base from which to service their Asian clients.“MAS will continue to enhance the ecosystem for fund managers, including building up the fund administration and fund domiciliation sectors, to ensure the long term sustainable growth of the asset management industry,” says a spokesperson.Mr Chong says MAS consulted last year on the requirement for the separation of fund management and fund administration functions. He believes part of the regulator’s next phase of building up administration services is to encourage administrators to offer an outsourced service to fund houses in order for the latter to comply with the independence requirements that will be imposed on them.State Street’s Mr Wright has a different stance. The bigger opportunity being considered by MAS, he believes, is for Asia to develop a fund passporting capability that encompasses either the whole of Asia-Pacific, or, more realistically, Asean member states, of which there are 10 including Singapore.“If this can be achieved you could potentially lose the link between fund domicile and fund administration centre,” he says. He does not see Singapore becoming a regional hub until a funds passporting solution akin to the European Union Ucits framework is realised.Questioned on whether a cross-border initiative is under discussion, a spokesperson for MAS says: “The Asean Capital Markets Forum, of which the Monetary Authority of Singapore is a member, is currently looking into developing mutual recognition of CIS [collective investment schemes] among Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] members.”To become a more attractive local fund domicile Singapore also needs more legal vehicles. The capability is there to set up a fund as a company, a unit trust or as a limited partnership but what is lacking is the flexibility of an open-ended investment company (Oeic) structure, which is widely used in centres such as the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg.“I believe MAS is aware the legal infrastructure needs to be expanded,” says Mr Ho.“If they’re able to get the framework out in a reasonable time, Singapore would put itself in a strong position to capture quality funds.”Peter Douglas, principal of GFIA, a Singapore-based hedge fund advisory business, is in agreement: “For the policy to be successful there needs to be a suite of different structures available. Singapore fund structures for a broader market have been on paper for a while but I think we’re beginning to see early signs of traction.”With a more flexible Oeic-like structure, MAS would hope to attract quality private equity, infrastructure and real estate funds in addition to hedge funds, says Mr Ho.
403;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-06-29T21:52:19Z;Overview: risk assets resume their upward march;Traders price in Greek austerity vote;Risk assets resumed their march higher after a brief pause in the wake of the Greek government’s parliamentary victory, with markets earlier heavily pricing in a vote to approve austerity measures.A spurt of “sell the fact” profit-taking edged global stocks, the euro and core government bond yields lower in mid-afternoon as investors digested the news from Athens.But risk trading later resumed with a vengeance as equities pushed to within a whisker of their best performance in more than two months and the euro reclaimed the $1.44 level.Simon Smith of FxPro said: “Price action ahead of the result largely anticipated a positive outcome, the euro already standing as one of the strongest performers so far this week.”US WTI crude prices surged more than $2 a barrel and led gains across the commodities complex as US supplies dropped more than expected last week.The vote opened the way for Greece to receive more bail-out funds from the European Union and International Monetary Fund but analysts warned of the dangers of “kicking the can down the road” in tackling the nation’s problems.Mr Smith said: “It feels like a hollow victory. Greece has voted to enact more austerity which, in all likelihood will continue to crush the economy while the debt burden continues to rise. The proposal on voluntary debt restructuring does not appear to be the panacea many are after because it’s a rollover that reduces the interest burden but does not impose a haircut on outstanding debt.”Others noted that price movements in recent days had shown markets signalling a growing danger that Portugal and Ireland could get sucked into a restructuring drama of their own.Simon Derrick, of Bank of New York Mellon, said: “While Greek/German yield gaps have actually narrowed modestly in recent days, the equivalent spreads for Ireland and Portugal have continued to widen out sharply.”And Divyang Shah of IFR Markets said: “It is difficult to argue with market price action, which has been showing a bias toward greater concern over Portugal compared to Ireland.“Given the ‘voluntary’ nature of private sector participation for Greece, it would make sense for banks/financials to rush for the exit now on Portugal and Ireland – next time, things might be a little less ‘voluntary’.”In the currency markets, the euro rose 0.5 per cent to $1.4433 against the dollar, having reached its highest level for a week immediately before the Greek vote.The focus on events in Athens allowed the single currency to shrug off a key reading of consumer confidence in the eurozone economic outlook, which hit a seven-month low in June.Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said: “We see eurozone GDP growth slowing sharply in the coming quarters as persistent weakness in the likes of Greece and Spain is accompanied by a slowdown elsewhere.”In the government bond markets there was respite for peripheral debt. Greek 10-year yields fell 20 basis points to 15.91 per cent while there was also some balm for benchmark Irish and Italian bonds, with yields tightening 13bp to 11.47 per cent and 4bp to 4.94 per cent, respectively.Yields on 10-year Bunds gained 3bp to 2.99 per cent while 10-year US Treasuries rose 8bp to 3.11 per cent following another dismal auction of $29bn in paper.In the equity markets, the FTSE All World index jumped 1.4 per cent, having reclaimed nearly all its losses for June amid its latest three-day rally.The S&P 500 added 0.8 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst rose 1.7 per cent, its best day since April 20.In the commodity markets, gains in Brent crude oil allowed it to recover all the losses triggered by the shock release of International Energy Agency strategic reserves last Thursday.
404;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-06-24T22:21:06Z;Overview: Growth and debt fears weigh heavily;;Markets endured another week of turbulence as the eurozone debt crisis rumbled on and concerns about the US economy were crystallised by the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve.The heightened mood of nervousness triggered further buying of US and German government bonds, the dollar and the Swiss franc as investors sold the euro and dumped European equities for an eighth successive week.Oil prices fell sharply after western governments agreed to release emergency strategic reserves to offset the impact of lost Libyan production.Greece dominated the headlines for most of the week as the government survived a crucial vote of confidence and forged an agreement with international lenders on a five-year austerity plan.However, the new measures still have to be passed by parliament before the next tranche of bail-out funds can be paid to Athens. Analysts warned that this may not be as straightforward as it might have seemed immediately after the confidence vote.“A week is a long time in politics and with Pasok [Greek ruling party] officials under intense pressure, nothing should be taken for granted,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. “Besides, the truth is that, even if the vote is carried comfortably, there are still plenty of issues for the market to worry about.”While Greece remained at the heart of market concerns, signs of contagion emerged elsewhere.The cost of insuring most peripheral eurozone countries’ sovereign debt against default – as measured by credit default swap spreads – widened sharply.Perhaps most worryingly, Italy, previously seen as a “non-core” peripheral compared with Greece, Portugal and Ireland, saw its CDS spread widen 36 basis points to 207bp after Moody‘s Investors’ Service warned late last week that the country’s credit rating could be downgraded.The extra yield demanded by investors to hold Italian rather than German debt hit euro-era records while shares in two top Italian banks were briefly suspended after falling sharply on fears about their capital positions.The worries over the eurozone periphery undermined confidence in the euro, sending the single currency to a fresh record low against the Swiss franc and driving it down 0.9 per cent against the dollar.There were also US-specific reasons for the dollar’s broad-based strength this week, principally the Federal Reserve’s failure to hint at the possibility of another round of quantitative easing (QE3) following the termination of its current asset purchase programme.The central bank’s stance came even as it lowered its forecasts for US growth this year and next.“The Fed only acted last year because the low and falling inflation rate suggested that deflation was becoming a serious threat,” said Stefan Angele, head of investment management at Swiss & Global Asset Management. “The subsequent rebound in core inflation suggests that the threat has eased, at least for now.”Timothy Ash, of RBS, said: “This week’s FOMC [meeting] left a pretty downbeat impression and we seem to be in something of a ‘sour spot’ whereupon US growth is feeble but not bad enough for QE3. This means a combination of less liquidity plus weaker global growth, which is not particularly appealing from a risk perspective.”The market’s worries over US growth were compounded by disappointing weekly labour market data.Optimism over the global recovery picture, meanwhile, was dented by weak Chinese and eurozone private sector activity figures – although German business confidence, as measured by the Ifo economic institute, showed remarkable resilience. The broad growth doubts, plus the continuing eurozone uncertainty, supported demand for the safety of US and German government bonds.The yield on the US 10-year Treasury fell 8bp to 2.88 per cent, testing its 2011 low, while the 10-year Bund yield dipped 11bp to 2.84 per cent.Against this backdrop, US and European equities saw volatile trading. By midday on Friday, the S&P 500 was up just 0.1 per cent over the week while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.2 per cent, led by the banks.However, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Average jumped 3.5 per cent while emerging market stocks rose 1.1 per cent after Wen Jiabao, China‘s premier, said efforts to curb inflation had worked. But economists welcomed news that 60m barrels of strategic oil reserves would be released over the coming month. Brent crude immediately tumbled more than 7 per cent, leaving it more than $8.50 a barrel cheaper over the week.“The unexpected decline in oil prices will work to give an extra boost to the global economy at a critical point in time,” said Danske Bank analysts. “It underpins our expectation that global growth will recover again in the second half of the year as the supply disruptions from Japan are reduced.”Other commodity prices were pressured by the firmer dollar and demand worries. Gold, down about $20 over the week to $1,507 an ounce, was on track for its worst week since May.
405;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-06-24T21:42:40Z;Sharp losses for technology sector;;Risk assets took another beating in the final session of a volatile week on Wall Street, with technology stocks suffering particularly sharp losses after disappointing earnings from some of the key players in the industry.Micron Technology, the chipmaker, saw the deepest losses on the S&P 500, falling 14.5 per cent to $7.21 after reporting a 92 per cent drop in earnings late in the previous session.Oracle, the business software and hardware giant, fell 4.1 per cent to $31.14 after reporting lacklustre growth in its hardware segment. The losses came despite a 36 per cent rise in overall fourth-quarter earnings.These losses helped weigh on the technology sector, which was down 1.8 per cent, the worst performing on Wall Street.Other cyclical sectors also suffered as investors continued to worry about the uncertain situation in Europe and were mostly reluctant to buy in case of bad news over the weekend.The industrial and financial sectors were down 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively. Among those stocks to lose ground were General Electric, which fell 2.2 per cent to $17.97, and Morgan Stanley, which declined 0.6 per cent to $22.21.These losses left the S&P 500 down 1.2 per cent to 1,268.45, a loss of 0.2 per cent over the week, leaving it on track for its worst month of losses in a year.The declines came despite some slightly better than expected economic data. The session saw GDP growth for the quarter revised up to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This was an improvement, but still a far cry from the 3.1 per cent GDP growth posted in the fourth quarter of last year.Durable good orders also rose by a stronger-than-expected 1.9 per cent in May on a rebound in demand for transportation equipment.“The economic data were a little better, but there was so much uncertainty going into the weekend that investors were reluctant to buy into the markets,” said Jeff Cleveland, senior economist with Payden & Rygel.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent to 11,937.30, leaving the index down 0.6 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower to 2,652.89 on Friday, but still up 1.4 per cent over the week.In deal news, Williams, a natural gas group, launched a $4.9bn cash bid for Southern Union in an attempt to break up an already agreed deal between the target and Energy Transfer Equity.The prospect of a bidding war left shares in Southern Union up 16.9 per cent to $39.92 and ETE down 5.6 per cent to $43.03. Williams was down 2.3 per cent to $28.55.Airline stocks suffered substantial losses in the session led by United Continental Holdings, which fell 8.5 per cent to $23 after providing a disappointing guidance. Delta Airlines declined 4.9 per cent to $9.45 while Southwest Airlines lost 0.4 per cent to $11.36.Airline stocks pared all of the gains that has been won in the previous session on the sharp drop in the oil price.The week on Wall Street began upbeat as investors bought into a depressed market that had seen nearly seven straight weeks of losses.But sentiment reversed on Wednesday after Ben Bernanke gave a cautious assessment of the US economy in a news conference, which then set the tone for the rest of the week.The markets reacted badly to news that the Federal Reserve had cut US growth forecasts, raised inflation estimates and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.Sentiment throughout the week was also weighed on by concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, which absorbed much of the interest and attention of traders.“The 800 pound gorilla is still the uncertainty over Greece,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Financial stocks were some of the worst performers of the week, weighed on by these concerns.Bank of New York Mellon was down 6 per cent over the week to $24.64 while SunTrust Banks fell 4.5 per cent to $25.
406;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-06-23T20:50:49Z;Energy and financials lead losses on Wall St;;"Energy and financial stocks led the losses in a volatile session on Wall Street as traders continued to digest the downbeat assessment of the US economy given by the Federal Reserve late in the previous session and also worried about a disappointing rise in unemployment claims.The markets tumbled in early trading on these worries, but then managed to rally somewhat towards the end of the session on news reports that European leaders had reached a breakthrough on a Greek austerity plan.Still, the financial sector still saw the sharpest losses in the session, falling 1 per cent as Fifth Third Bancorp fell 2.5 per cent to $12.09 and Bank of New York Mellondeclined 2.3 per cent to $25.44. The KBW banking index was down 1 per cent.Industrial stocks also suffered from a “risk off” trade. Boeing was down 1.2 per cent to $71.25 as the S&P industrial index fell 0.3 per cent.But the worst losses came from the energy sector as oil prices fell hard after an unexpected intervention in the oil markets by the International Energy Agency.The S&P energy index was down 1.1 per cent as Schlumberger fell 0.6 per cent to $83.10 and Chevron lost 1.7 per cent to $99.36.The sell-off in risk assets began late on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered its growth forecast for the US economy and lifted its inflation expectations.The downbeat mood persisted into Thursday’s session, and the S&P 500 was down 1.5 per cent by mid-session.But the markets reversed some of their losses in late trading following a Reuters report that Greece had forged a deal with the EU and IMF on a five-year austerity plan.The S&P 500 then closed only 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.50.Helping keep the index in negative territory, however, was data from the labour department showing that the number of unemployed Americans filing for jobless benefits rose 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 429,000 last week, which was more than had been expected by economists.Separate data from the commerce department showed that new home sales fell 2.1 per cent in May, though the news was not all bad as the median home sale price rose 2.6 per cent from April.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.5 per cent to 12,053.93. The Nasdaq Composite ended the session up 0.7 per cent to 2,686.82.The Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 7.5 per cent to 29.77.Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, argued that the losses in the session were due to a downturn in sentiment rather than any change in the fundamentals, as the economic data were mixed and the Federal Reserve did not say anything that had not been anticipated.The financial sector actually saw some strong gains in the session, led by Western Digitalwhich jumped 7.1 per cent to $37.01 after a favourable analyst report. Elsewhere, Red Hat gained 3.6 per cent to $45.27 after the software company reported better-than-
expected first-quarter earnings and raised its forecast for the year.Micron Technology was up 3.1 per cent to $8.43 while Nvidiaadded 3 per cent to $16.21. The S&P technology sector was up 0.9 per cent.The healthcare sector saw almost no losses in the session, helped by gains from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer after the companies said their blood thinner Apixaban (Eliquis) had seen some positive trial results. Bristol-Myers was up 5.7 per cent to $29.33 while Pfizer added 1.8 per cent to $20.65.In other news, Rite Aid, the drugstore chain, was up 5.5 per cent to $1.16 after reporting a smaller-than-
expected first-quarter loss driven by a decline in expenses and stronger same-store sales growth.Lennar, the homebuilder, also reported a loss that was better than analysts had expected. Its stock was up 2.3 per cent to $18.51, but it was still 1.8 per cent lower over the year.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, rose 5.3 per cent to $56.93 after its first-quarter earnings beat earnings targets and the company raised its outlook for profit growth this yearConAgra, the maker of Healthy Choice frozen meals, was down 0.2 per cent to $25.37 after its earnings fell short of expectations and investors worried about the effect of higher commodity costs."
407;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-06-21T21:32:03Z;Equities buoyed as fears ease over Greece;;A more optimistic view of the Greek debt crisis, and a burst of bid and merger activity, combined to lift global equities, commodities and the euro.After markets had closed in New York, a critical vote of confidence by Greece’s parliament in the country’s revamped government was passed. That in turn sent the euro a touch lower in thin trade ahead of Asian markets opening on Wednesday.The Greek government must now win approval for further austerity measures, required for the release of the next tranche of the country’s bail-out funds.“An affirmative confidence vote does not equate to the adoption of the level of austerity measures required to ensure the ongoing support of the European Union and the International Monetary Fund,” said David Ader, strategist at CRT Capital.Analysts were focusing on next week’s crucial votes. “It would be prudent to reserve at least a modicum of doubt that this will automatically translate into a vote for the austerity measures at the end of the month,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He added that should the EU and IMF approve the next tranche of funding, a harder task lay ahead as the focus of attention switched to the “Kafkaesque” matter of the next bail-out. “In the face of ECB objections, the EU must secure a comprehensive ‘voluntary rollover’ from the multitude of Greece’s creditors and do so without prompting the rating agencies to declare a default,” Mr Mellor said.“Put simply, any further bail-out would be untenable without the rating agencies first being on board.”Ahead of the vote, the euro continued to rise against the dollar – and it closed out New York trading just above the $1.44 level – and gained ground against most other leading currencies. After the Greek parliament vote was passed, however, the euro was trading back at $1.4370.Peripheral eurozone government bond markets had also reflected hopes of a yes vote in Greece.The yield on the 10-year Greek bond shed 31 basis points to 17.03 per cent while five-year Greek credit default swaps, a gauge of the cost of insuring against a sovereign default, tightened 24bp to 1,908bp, according to Markit data.Most other peripheral government bond prices rose, driving yields lower.The spread between Spanish and German 10-year yields narrowed 9bp after Spain sold about €3bn of three- and six-month bills.German Bunds fell, pushing their yield up 2bp to 2.98 per cent amid the more confident tone towards Greece and after the ZEW index of German investor confidence fell for a fourth successive month.“After the impressive growth performance of the first quarter, the economy cannot elude the global trend of a soft patch,” said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING. “However, with strong fundamentals, a high backlog of orders as a safety net for production and a pick-up in private consumption, the soft patch in Germany should be shortlived and rather mild.”In the US, the 10-year Treasury yield inched up 2bp to 2.98 per cent. Existing home sales fell 3.8 per cent in May to a six-month low, although the decline was not as bad as some had feared. That helped bolster equity markets across the globe with further cheer coming from SABMiller’s $10bn bid for Australian brewer Foster’s Group.In New York, the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1.5 per cent and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 1.1 per cent.Emerging market stocks broke a four-day run of losses, rising 1.4 per cent.Commodity markets put in a more mixed performance, however.Brent oil was down 74 cents to $110.95 a barrel, although copper bounced back above $9,000 a tonne. Gold rose for a third day, reaching $1,545 an ounce.
408;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-06-19T07:56:49Z;Beasts and boutiques squeeze middle players;Mid-market malaise saw some firms suffer double-digit declines in 2010;"If you were looking for an insight into the ebbs and flows in the UK pension fund sector, you could do worse than alight on the pension fund of the UK arm of Philips, the Dutch electronics group. PDF of FTfm’s full researchDuring 2010, the £2.1bn ($3.4bn) scheme terminated mandates with AllianceBernstein, Aberdeen Asset Management, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Record Currency Management, according to MandateWire, a sister service of FTfm. These are four of the groups that have seen a marked decline in the assets they manage on behalf of UK funds.The Philips fund also de-risked by raising its exposure to fixed income and dumping asset-backed securities and credit default swap overlays, asset classes indelibly linked to the pre-crisis boom in financial engineering.This de-risking trend, which is also expressed by ever rising enthusiasm for liability driven investment (LDI), alongside a continued drift of assets from active to passive management, has created a raft of winners and losers.Among the winners are the big beasts of Legal & General Investment Management, which has come to dominate the world of passive management, and BlackRock, which ticks all the boxes with strength in passive, LDI and bonds.However, two other top 10 houses, Insight Investment Management and Schroders, saw 30 per cent-plus rises in assets last year, outstripping the dominant duopoly.Abdallah Nauphal, chief executive of Insight, attributes the group’s 80 per cent jump in UK pension assets in the past three years, to its early embrace of both LDI and absolute return strategies, strengths he believes will continue to hold it in good stead, in spite of rising competition in both fields.“There is no doubt that LDI will continue to grow. There have been a number of new entrants into the space but they haven’t been so successful because they don’t have the track record and have probably invested less in infrastructure,” he says. But Insight is not resting on its laurels, with Mr Nauphal’s belief that institutional investors will increasingly prize assets that introduce real diversification into their portfolios prompting the seeding of two new asset classes: consumer debt recovery and global farmland.Mr Nauphal also believes Insight’s future is brighter now it is part of the multi-boutique range of Bank of New York Mellon, having passed through the hands of troubled high-street banks HBOS and Lloyds.“It does provide a much more comfortable environment. You can become a decimal point in the budget process [as part of a large mainstream bank]; you are a small ship amid huge waves,” says Mr Nauphal.Similarly, Miles O’Connor, head of UK institutional business at Schroders, partially attributes his company’s success in gathering assets to its strengths in LDI per se and the diversified growth strategies that many pension funds favour as a return-seeking bucket alongside LDI programmes.But he says Schroders has also benefited from some funds switching from country or region-specific equity funds to global vehicles that give the manager greater freedom to alter the underlying exposures, a trend identified separately by Aberdeen.“The consultancies have been driving these changes very strongly for the last few years,” says Mr O’Connor. “The manager is not being anchored to an index, it is benchmark unaware.”Schroders has also gained market share for its default funds for defined contribution schemes, according to Mr O’Connor, with some schemes rowing back from offering entirely passive equity vehicles.“Diversified growth funds are being used extensively. In 2008/09 the typical default fund would have had a substantial weighting to equity and the volatility would have been higher than for a diversified growth fund,” he says.A number of smaller boutiques also saw sharp rises in UK pension fund assets in 2010, albeit from relatively low bases, meaning most remain outside the top 25. Ruffer led the way with a 258 per cent rise to £3.4bn, meaning the house, rooted in the private client community, is coming on to the radar of more pension consultants. Ruffer’s trump card has been its multi-asset, absolute return strategy, which has attracted pension funds that found themselves over exposed to equities in the 2008 crash.Rogge Global Partners has broken into the top 25, thanks to a 45.7 per cent rise in assets to £8.7bn.Rogge, which is 77 per cent owned by Old Mutual Asset Managers, has seen inflows into its investment-grade credit, LDI and “cash-plus” global bond strategies, but John Graham, senior partner, says: “We have seen particular interest in the emerging markets side of our business”.Analysis of MandateWire reveals Rogge has picked up a series of mandates lost by Record Currency Management, whose flagship strategy revolves around the carry trade, the practice of going long high-yielding currencies and shorting low-yielding ones.With little variation bet­ween developed world interest rates now, a number of pension schemes have switched to Rogge’s emerging market currency fund.“The carry trade has a lot of volatility, there have been some periods that have been pretty negative for these funds,” says Mr Graham. “We run an emerging market currency fund focused on the currencies that are most undervalued because their central banks intervene and manage these currencies.“It has less volatility and when structural change happens, you will see a structural uplift in the value of the fund.”Natixis Global Associates, the distribution arm of Natixis Global Asset Management, a $750bn multi-boutique with 22 affiliates, saw its UK pension assets rise 125 per cent to £4bn in 2010, in the wake of a 50 per cent rise in the size of its UK team, to 30.Terry Mellish, head of the UK arm of NGA, says there had been strong interest in offerings from Loomis Sayles and H2O, two fixed-income specialists; Harris Associates, a “conviction-led” value equity manager; Aurora, an alternatives house; and Alpha Simplex, which majors in volatility management.Between the successful be­hemoths and boutiques, AllianceBernstein, Aberdeen, Goldman Sachs, Henderson and Axa point to a mid-market malaise; all of these, between 8th and 16th in the rankings last year, suffered double-digit declines in 2010.Goldman says there is “no real theme” behind its 15.9 per cent decline in assets, and that “the main explanation is that a number of large clients changed their investment strategies”.This is borne out by analysis of terminations on MandateWire, which re­veals no smoking gun but a smattering of losses for currency, hedge fund and fixed income mandates.Goldman says last October’s hiring of Paul Trickett, previously head of the Emea investment practice at Towers Watson, reflected its commitment to the market, and that flows were positive since January.Claude Chene, European chief executive of AllianceBernstein, argues that performance and, to some extent, shifts in the wider investment landscape are cyclical. The losers will be fervently hoping this is so."
409;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-06-16T08:23:56Z;BNY Mellon to open European clearing unit;;BNY Mellon, the US financial services group, is extending its clearing operations with a European business to clear futures and exchange-traded derivatives for local customers.The development is another example of how banks and other institutions pushing ahead with the contruction of entities to cope with incoming regulation from Dodd-Frank and the European Markets Infrastructure Directive (Emir), introduced to underpin the stability of financial markets.Regulators of the G20 group of economies have pushed for more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market to be cleared, where possible, through clearing houses. Authorities have pinpointed the institutions as critical for offsetting systemic risk in the global financial system.The battle to capture trading flow by clearing derivatives is moving from the US to Europe, which is behind the US in its implementation of new regulations.Headquartered in Dublin, BNY Mellon’s operation is the first MiFID authorised futures and derivatives clearing entity in Ireland and is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.The business will be an adjunct to BNY Mellon’s US business, where it serves as an intermediary between the customer and a clearing house. Investors will be able to trade derivatives and have them cleared without becoming a member of a clearing house.Tim Murphy, who will head the BNY Mellon Clearing International for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told FT Trading Room that the business intended to become a clearing member on other major global exchanges and central clearing houses.“It’s a logical extension of our market sector,” he said. “The changing regulatory demand creates a need that we recognised.”BNY Mellon is already a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade and the International Derivatives Clearing group in the US.BNY Mellon said that it would clear more over the counter (OTC) swaps as they moved through recognised clearing houses.The new business will also strengthen BNY Mellon’s ties with Ireland where it employes more than 1800 people.
410;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-05-31T19:48:19Z;Forget Greece, it’s all about China;Long-term value of euro may depend more on China;"Forget Greece. The suggestion that Germany is coming around to the idea of a third rescue package for Athens moved markets, but the long-term value of the euro may depend more on China.Start with the observation that the euro is more closely correlated with emerging market equities than with European or US equities. All three move closely with the currency, thanks to the global “risk-on/risk-off” trade, which sees sentiment swings by investors push equities and the dollar in opposite directions.Why are EM shares more tightly linked to the euro? As investor sentiment turns bullish, hot money piles into EM equities. This prompts EM central banks to print local currency to buy dollars, to hold down their currencies (stoking local inflation in the process, as they in effect import US monetary policy).Reserve managers then look at their growing pile of dollars, and – justifiably worried about the safety of US Treasuries – shift some into euros, pushing up the euro against the dollar, as Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon points out. Over the past two years, the proportion of disclosed EM reserves in euros has fallen slightly to 28.3 per cent. But the proportion in dollars has dropped faster, so relatively more is going to euros.China is far and away the biggest holder of foreign reserves, and although it does not say where they are held, it has been keen to publicise investments in euro bonds. It should be no surprise that the smoothed monthly rise in Chinese reserves has tracked the euro’s value against the dollar over the past few years; the bigger its reserves, the more it puts into euros.While this has helped prop up the single currency, it may not last. Noises from Beijing about revaluing the renminbi are getting louder. That would mean less intervention and less reserve money going into euros. The single currency’s long-term prospects against the dollar look shaky."
411;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-05-29T11:16:36Z;BNY Mellon targets Asian sovereign wealth funds;Asia is seeing fast growth in its sovereign wealth funds;BNY Mellon early this year created a Singapore-based unit focused on serving sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, central banks and supranationals, becoming the latest bank to sharpen its focus on this growing source of capital.Sovereign wealth funds are certainly not new – they were first established more than 50 years ago and many of the dominant ones have been in place for more than 20 years.However, with high commodity prices and growing wealth in Asia, more SWFs are being set up and they are accumulating assets faster than other market segments. They are also demanding a wider range of services as they invest those funds.Jai Arya, head of BNY Mellon’s new four-person sovereign institutions group, says the bank is sharpening its focus on this market segment by creating a single contact point between the bank’s different business units and this increasingly important market segment.“We’re building what we don’t have and tweaking what we have,” Mr Arya says. “The philosophy is to deliver the whole firm, and in doing that I work with everyone across the company. Within the bank you have P&L divided by product such as institutional, private banking and investment banking, and then you have it broken up by geography. In a product silo world you have the tendency to create capability in silos. We have similar silos in our bank, but for this client segment we’re trying to work across all lines of business.”It is an approach many banks have taken in recent years. With sovereign wealth funds becoming more aggressive and demanding in their investment approach, banks are finding this market segment often demands attention from all their different business units.UBS estimates the total assets under management of the SWF industry is more than US$3,000bn, which is three times as large as private equity assets and about 30 per cent more than the hedge fund industry has under management.“Our internal forecast is that sovereign fund assets will grow at 18 per cent per annum, compared to the regular mutual and pension funds growing at 6 or 7 per cent, and insurance growing at 10 per cent,” says Peter Burnett, head of global capital markets at UBS. “They’re not as big as mutual funds in the amount of capital they provide, but they are getting there.”In 2009, UBS created an internal committee made up of regional and business heads who deal with the sovereign investor market, drawn largely from its asset management and investment banking units. The committee meets regularly to discuss the bank’s approach to SWFs.“There are all these contact points with sovereigns across the bank, and now we are pulling them together so we’re more aware of what the different parts of the business are doing and leveraging that relation from one part of the bank to the other,” Mr Burnett says.Co-ordinating the different businesses of the bank has become particularly relevant since the financial crisis as sovereigns have begun to play a more important funding role within capital markets due to tighter market liquidity.“Sovereign wealth funds are now a regular anchor investor in IPOs, which was not the case five or six years ago when there was more capital in the private sector,” Mr Burnett says. SWFs also took advantage of lower valuations following the financial crisis to invest in real estate and take passive positions in private companies.“With their accumulation of capital, in part the result of the recent bull market in commodities, sovereign wealth funds have become more active in strategic and direct investment internationally and that means they increasingly need the assistance of banks such as ourselves,” Mr Burnett says.Mr Arya agrees the interest of SWFs in the alternative investment space creates new opportunities for banks that can offer more than just asset management.“The front office tends to move faster than the back office can, which creates an area of exposure as there is definitely more support and advice required on alternative investment services than other investment areas,” Mr Arya says.BNY Mellon tracks the activities of about 149 sovereigns, and puts a higher estimate on sovereign wealth fund assets than UBS of up to $4,200bn. Taking into account the $10,000bn of central bank assets and the money managed by super nationals and sovereign pensions, Mr Arya estimates this market to total nearly $20,000bn, with assets growing at 10-15 per cent a year.He estimates that about 40 per cent of those assets are in Asia, with 35 per cent in the Middle East, 15 per cent in Europe and the remainder spread around the rest of the world.Emerging markets in particular have seen an increase in interest from SWFs. The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation in April announced it was setting up an office in India, and oil-fuelled Middle Eastern SWFs have steadily built up a greater investment presence in China and the rest of Asia in the past five years.“What we see now is a hunt for yield,” says Cynthia Sweeney Barnes, global head of sovereigns and supranationals at HSBC. “They are looking at the inflationary pressure in the developing world and the rise in real [interest] rates. In general there is great interest in emerging markets.”In 2010 HSBC expanded its sovereign wealth team, previously weighted towards London and the Middle East, with new positions in Latin America and Singapore.“In the last few years we have seen our sovereign book of business increase by a few hundred per cent each year, so we not only want to be responsive to that growth but be ahead of the trend in terms of the kinds of services we offer these clients,” says Ms Sweeney Barnes.
412;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-05-27T21:34:34Z;Overview: Risk assets ride out EU contagion fear;;A week dominated by fears of contagion from the eurozone debt crisis left risk assets largely undamaged as sentiment recovered on guarded optimism that policymakers could contain the Greek crisis.“Its been another rollercoaster week on financial markets with share markets starting on a weak note on more worries about European debt problems and falls in business conditions readings in Europe and China,” said Shane Oliver, of AMP Capital Investors. “Only then to see another midweek rebound on better earnings news as higher commodity prices pushed up resources stocks and as bargain hunters moved in again.”Gains on Friday ensured that global equities had their first positive week in four, while the euro recovered from a two-month low against the dollar to make progress over the five days.The euro’s oscillating fortunes over the week saw it take a big knock on Thursday as Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, warned that the International Monetary Fund may withhold aid to Greece.Reassuring noises on Friday against a restructuring of Greek debt from Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, and George Provopoulos, European Central Bank governing council member, calmed investor nerves.The prospect of China buying eurozone bail-out bonds was a key factor, said Neil Mellor, of Bank of New York Mellon. “There can be little doubt that word of China’s reported intent to stand by the eurozone’s sovereigns has tempered fears for Greece and its crisis stalemate,” he noted.“Just how long the eurozone’s credit line with China will prove to be is impossible to know but for the time being, assurances that it will be a dominant presence at European financial stability facility auctions may have proved sufficient to wrest a recovery from a month-long slump in sentiment.”Michael Derks, of FxPro, struck a downbeat note, highlighting the dangers for those European banks with large Greek bond exposure.“It is evident that the contagion from Greece’s precarious financial predicament is spreading more widely through Europe,” he said. “Europe’s debt crisis remains a slow-motion car crash. If sovereign wealth funds did not remain so determined to diversify out of dollars, the euro would surely be much lower.”Weaker economic data on both sides of the Atlantic, provoking renewed concerns over economic growth, depressed yields on core government bonds.Lacklustre figures on Thursday on US first- quarter growth, consumer spending and jobless claims were followed on Friday by pending home sales dropping to a seven-month low.Yields on 10-year Treasuries dipped to a six-month trough of 3.07 per cent on Thursday and dipped 7 basis points over the week.Eurozone economic sentiment figures released on Friday were also a setback for growth bulls – the third straight month of disappointing confidence data.“The overall retreat in eurozone economic sentiment to a seven-month low in May fuels suspicion that eurozone economic activity is now coming off the boil,” said Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight. “The European Commission’s survey reinforces belief that the ECB is most likely to raise interest rates again in July rather than June.”Yields on 10-year German Bunds fell below 3 per cent for the first time since January on Thursday, slipping 5bp over the week to 2.99 per cent. Although Greek benchmark yields rose 16bp over the week on the latest rumblings of the debt crisis, Spain’s fell 12bp.It was a similar story for peripheral five-year credit default swap spreads – a measure of the cost of insuring against a sovereign default.Greece’s hit a record intraday high on Tuesday of 1,525bp according to Markit data and widened nearly 100bp over the week to 1,438bp. Portugal’s rose by 63bp to 700bp but Spain’s fell back marginally by 6bp to 261bp.In the currency markets, the Swiss franc emerged as the week’s star performer, hitting record highs against the dollar and the euro as investors flocked to the haven currency.“In the current quarter, the Swissie is easily the best-performing major currency, up almost 8 per cent against the dollar and 7 per cent against the euro,” noted Mr Derks. “The Swissie’s enduring appeal is easy to understand – both the dollar and the pound are being deliberately debased by their respective central banks while the euro remains beset by valid concerns over the solvency of some of its members.”In the equity markets, a positive session on Friday boosted the FTSE All World index 0.3 per cent over the weak. In the same period, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 0.1 per cent lower, and the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent.Commodities advanced as the Reuters-Jeffries CRB index gained 1.4 per cent over the week, with gains for oil and gold. “Despite this week’s partial recovery, we continue to expect the price of a barrel of Brent crude to drop back below $90 by the end of the year, as global demand slows, the Middle East risk premium fades, and the dollar rebounds,” said Julian Jessop, of Capital Economics.
413;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-05-25T21:44:05Z;Risky assets recover poise after sell-off;;"Equities and commodities continued to stabilise following the risk sell-off seen at the start of this week, although nagging worries over eurozone sovereign debt kept anxiety levels among investors high.The latest concerns centred largely around Greece’s political stability, given reports of a snap general election or a possible referendum over planned budget cuts and asset sales. The government denied the rumours.“The focus right now is on whether Greece will follow through on agreed-upon austerity measures amid widespread local dissent,” said Michael Woolfolk, of BNY Mellon.“Judging from recent remarks by EU officials, there is little doubt that Europe will provide the funds needed to keep Greece from a full default. However, the question has now become whether the so-called ‘reprofiling’ of Greek debt is a technical default.”Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, commented: “Increased pressure on Greece to step up its privatisation programme may buy the country more time; restructuring worries may be postponed and a potential conflict with the European Central Bank offset for now.”But she added: “Whether or not enough has been done to prevent contagion spreading further into the eurozone remains to be seen.”In spite of the growing concerns about a Greek political standoff, the cost of insuring against a debt default by the country fell from the record high struck on Tuesday. Spanish and Italian credit default swaps also narrowed.On the currency markets, the euro held broadly steady against the dollar, although it fell to a record low against the Swiss franc.Peripheral eurozone government bond yields were broadly steady, even as German Bund yields held at 3.05 per cent – just above a four-month low.In the US, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 1bp to 3.12 per cent despite weak US data and a very strong auction of 5-year notes.US durable goods orders fell 3.6 per cent in April after a 4.4 per cent increase in March.Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the apparent weakness of business investment was becoming a cause for concern.“At a time when prices are rising rapidly for capital equipment, the slowdown looks even more severe in real terms,” he said. “Despite strong profit growth and unusually low borrowing costs, it appears firms remain reluctant to invest.”The latest set of weak US economic data had only limited impact on Wall Street equities. The S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent as bargain-hunters moved in following the losses of recent sessions.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent, although the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo slipped 0.6 per cent.Recent worries over eurozone debt and the outlook for the global economy have prompted some in the markets to fear that a sharp correction could be on the cards.But Kevin Gardiner, head of global investment strategy at Barclays Wealth, said the issue was less about whether stocks would face a sell-off – given a plethora of potential triggers – but how large it might be and how investors should respond.“Our central view remains that the recovery in the US and global economy, though patchy, will remain intact and will be echoed in corporate profits, whose growth is keeping a lid on equity valuations,” he said.“A combination of growth and favourable valuations suggests to us that renewed developed equity market volatility could be a good long-term entry point.”In commodities, Brent crude oil jumped close to $115 a barrel, pushed up by US inventories data, while copper rose back above $9,000 a tonne. Gold reached a three-week high as investors sought safety from the mounting uncertainty over Greek debt."
414;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20. Yandex was priced on Monday night at $25 a share, valuing the company at $8bn.The jump in price was small compared with LinkedIn last Thursday, when shares in the business-focused social networking site jumped 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on their first day of trading.LinkedIn was up 8.1 per cent to $95.45 on Tuesday, in spite of restrictions having been lifted on short selling the stock, which pared all of the losses seen since the first day of trading on Thursday.Elsewhere, shares in El Paso Corp were up 6.5 per cent to $20.22, the best performing stock on the S&P 500, after the natural gas group announced it intended to separate its exploration and production unit from its pipeline and midstream businesses.Medtronicwas down 0.9 per cent to $40.88 after the medical devices company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 19 per cent on restructuring and other charges. Revenues were up slightly and better than expected, however.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

The fact that we were able to secure an agreement on what the objectives should be, what the triggers should be and what the scope should be, really was a major agreement,” said Charles Dallara, IIF managing director.
417;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-04-28T20:33:43Z;Skills transfer helps a Japanese town;;Kiyoshi Murakami has two identities, two sets of attire and two business cards.During the week, the 51-year-old head of human resources for BNY Mellon, the US bank, in Tokyo wears a dapper suit and carries a briefcase.But, following the massive earthquake and tsunami last month that destroyed his home town of Rikuzentakata, he swaps his Tokyo attire for rubber boots and a raincoat, and heads at weekends for the town on Japan’s north-east coast. There, he works long hours in a makeshift town office – the real one was ruined by the huge waves – helping the relief and rebuilding efforts. “I was in Hong Kong on business when the disaster struck and I thought I just have to do something to help,” Mr Murakami tells the 150-plus people at the first meeting in Tokyo of AidTakata, the organisation he has set up to co-ordinate help for the town.It is believed to be the first such organisation to centralise private relief and reconstruction efforts for one town, making it easier for the overstretched municipal government to ask for and receive help and information.Mr Murakami says a consolidated body makes it easier for the mayor, Futoshi Toba, and his staff to deal with all the different organisations in a co-ordinated manner.He and a number of other people involved in AidTakata have direct experience of how non-government organisations and other non-political groups work.With a career that spans studying in the US, working for the United Nations refugee agency, and his current position, Mr Murakami is putting his communication, organisational, training and foreign-language business skills and his wide network of high-level contacts to use. He also brings an outside perspective to the town hall, where many of the municipal government staff members are dead, missing or homeless, or grieving for lost family.On one recent Saturday, he juggled helping those in charge of distributing supplies to the thousands of displaced residents, mentoring the town mayor, training the press officer, giving interviews in English and improving the website for AidTakata, and visiting the debris of his own family’s three houses.“It’s important to go through the proper routes of the government and prefecture for help,” says Mr Toba, “but there are ‘impossible favours’ that you have to ask – that’s where people like [Mr Murakami] come in.”For example, normally municipal and central government contact is very limited, and this has led to frustrations about the extent to which municipal governments are being heard in Tokyo and the speed at which they receive help. Mr Murakami was able to open a line of communication between the local authority and central government through Shozo Azuma, a ruling Democratic party member of the lower house, who Mr Murakami had met through his time at UNHCR. “Since we’re close friends, it’s easy to talk,” Mr Murakami says.As he stands next to a plot of land where one of his family homes once stood, Mr Murakami says the landscape reminds him of a UNHCR visit to Sierra Leone he made at the end of the civil war there nearly a decade ago.He is using his skills handling staff working in distressing environments and has borrowed from business to act as a kind of personal mentor to Mr Toba, working through “mental exercises” to help him cope with his task of leading the town into recovery at a time when he is grieving for his dead wife and worries about his children.Mr Murakami’s work for the town does not end when the weekend is over.After a day’s work at BNY Mellon, he liaises with community leaders and the municipal government on the next steps for AidTakata and continues to guide town hall staff via Skype. A current priority is to organise help to get a server for Rikuzentakata’s makeshift town hall.When he was a child, Mr Murakami’s schoolteacher was shocked at his pupil’s determination to study overseas. His experiences are now proving an important contribution to Rikuzentakata’s recovery.

Openness is commendable, but – as in Gorbachev-era Russia – increased transparency could have unintended consequences.Traders will have to relearn deeply ingrained habits. Parsing the FOMC’s statement, of 150-odd words, is a skill that will go the way of cold war Kremlinology or programming in Cobol. Now Ben Bernanke can use far more words to deliver nuance and delve into technicalities – relevant with QE2 bond purchases due to end in June.The question time also risks Mr Bernanke confronting political questions: about the dollar (at a post-crisis low on a trade-weighted basis), the US credit rating (under threat) and politicians (logjammed over fiscal policy). Any hint of a political view would roil markets.Longer term, however, conferences should strengthen the chairman’s control over the Fed’s message. Of late, Fedspeak has come largely from hawkish regional governors. This obscures Mr Bernanke’s feat at the last meeting in mustering unanimous support for a highly controversial policy. He is still guiding the Fed. Now he will have ample opportunity to demonstrate this, and lay out his case.Mr Bernanke is still more worried by deflation than inflation. The market is not: five and 10-year inflation break-evens derived from Treasury inflation-protected securities are back up to their levels from before the credit crisis.But Mr Bernanke may explain how high commodity prices can depress the economy, and prices. For evidence, BNY Mellon suggests traffic statistics for the US – total miles driven grew through several recessions, but have fallen since the oil price spike of 2008.With precious metals prices at exceptionally high levels, even a long presentation from the Fed chairman will not persuade markets that deflationary fears are justified.

419;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-04-07T21:47:36Z;Euro pulls back from 14-month high after ECB decision;;"The euro eased but remained close to a 14-month high against the dollar on Thursday after the European Central Bank delivered its first interest rate rise since the financial crisisGiven recent hawkish commentary from ECB policymakers, the 25 basis point rise in eurozone borrowing costs to 1.25 per cent was fully priced into the market. The prospect of higher eurozone rates had driven the euro higher, pushing it to a peak of $1.4350 against the dollar on Wednesday, its highest level since
January 2010.Analysts said any indication that the ECB was set to embark on a sustained campaign of monetary tightening would prompt further rises in the single currency.But the euro eased back after Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, said the central bank would continue to monitor inflation “very closely”, a sign, according to analysts, that the next rate rise was unlikely to come at its next meeting.Last month, Mr Trichet used the term “strong vigilance” on inflation to flag up this month’s rise. “It is crystal clear that the ECB is prepared to continue raising rates as needed to fight inflationary risks,” said Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon.“However, the timing remains an open question. In light of the phrase ‘strong vigilance’ being dropped, the conclusion is that Mr Trichet is leaning towards a pause.”By late day in New York, the euro fell 0.2 per cent to $1.4309 against the dollar. The euro pulled back from an 11-month high against the yen, falling 0.9 per cent to Y121.44, eased 0.1 per cent to £0.8767 against the pound and was 0.5 per cent weaker at SFr1.3104 against the Swiss franc.The future path of eurozone monetary policy trumped concerns over the fiscal health of countries on the periphery of the region.Indeed, the euro showed little reaction to news that Portugal was set to ask its eurozone partners for a bail-out packageKit Juckes at Société Générale said Lisbon’s plight was hardly a surprise. “This train crash has been coming along at a very slow pace for a long time.”"
420;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-04-03T09:23:28Z;Top US managers study bank overcharging claim;;With allegations mounting in the US that banks have overcharged pension funds for foreign exchange transactions, mutual fund investors are asking whether they are being fleeced too.The latest lawsuit was filed by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which accuses Bank of New York Mellon of bilking its pension fund during forex trades. The court case comes on the heels of similar suits charging that pension funds in four states had been defrauded by BNY or a competitor, State Street Corp.Now Fidelity and the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, have reportedly looked into whether they were overbilled. According to The Wall Street Journal, BlackRock discovered the allegedly questionable charges because a newly acquired subsidiary had better monitoring systems than it did and received better prices from custody banks, including Bank of New York Mellon Corp.BlackRock declined to comment. Fidelity’s trading desk handles the vast majority of its funds’ forex transactions, although a subsidiary does use custodian banks for certain trades, Vincent Loporchio says in a statement. The firm is “monitoring information and allegations concerning custodian bank practices”, he says. There is no information as yet from Fidelity as to which banks are suspected.Both BNY and State Street have denied wrongdoing.The lawsuits allege the banks inflated the prices of forex trades in violation of their agreements with the pension funds. In addition to Septa, BNY is being sued by Virginia and Florida.State Street faces lawsuits by California and Arkansas, and it agreed to pay the state of Washington a nearly $12m out-of-court settlement last year after similar accusations over the pricing of foreign exchange trades. Attorneys general in Massachusetts and Illinois are also said to be investigating.“The first principles in any market where you don’t have transparency and regulation is that people are potential victims of predatory behaviour,” says Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a Wall Street watchdog group. “The urgency to have transparency and regulation could not be more clear.”Many mutual funds rely on custodian banks for forex trading in the same way pension funds do. “A few pennies of difference can cost a fund complex tens or hundreds of millions of dollars if they’re trading billions of dollars of securities,” says Ron Fernandes, chief executive of Raven Partners.The funds’ managers are starting to demand more information from custodian banks.“What’s it going to cost us? How are you going to charge us?” asks David Thelander, managing director of Promontory Financial Group. “There are ways to structure a revised agreement so both sides understand their responsibilities.”The $4,000bn-a-day foreign exchange market is notoriously opaque.If a US mutual fund seeks to buy or sell a foreign security, first it must convert its dollars to the appropriate currency. Many fund complexes – especially smaller firms, or large ones making difficult trades – use custodian banks to execute those foreign exchange transactions.Custodian banks’ clients typically either directly negotiate the price of each transaction or place orders through “standing instruction” services, in which banks handle large numbers of transactions in bulk and the client learns the price later. The pension funds’ lawsuits allege the custodian banks used the opacity of standing instructions to game the system.Septa’s lawsuit alleges BNY – which bills itself as “the world’s largest global custodian,” with more than $20,000bn in assets under custody – assured clients that standing instruction forex trades were subject to best execution standards, which require the bank to obtain the best possible prices for its clients.However, the bank did not provide the transit system with time-stamped trading data that would have reflected the actual price of each trade, according to the lawsuit. Instead, the bank only disclosed to clients the full range of prices for the day, and “pocketed the difference” between its own relatively good trading prices and the worse prices it charged clients, the lawsuit charges.“If some of the accusations are true, that’s a very serious manipulative activity,” says David Hearth, a partner at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker. “It could be a breach of the responsibilities the custodians have, depending on what the clients’ contracts say and what the custodian disclosed to its clients.”BNY publishes a guaranteed range of rates each morning, allows clients to opt out by 11 am and reports prices to clients daily, spokesman Kevin Heine says. Clients choose its standing instruction services because they provide “substantial benefits,” including better-than-retail prices and relief from certain risks and costs, he says.Foreign exchange trading is complex and demanding, and many fund managers do not have the desire or ability to negotiate their own trades, according to Mr Hearth. “The problem with it being automatic is the fund is a little bit of a captive customer,” he says.Maura McDermott is a reporter on Board IQ, a Financial Times publication
421;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-03-30T21:39:08Z;Equities buoyed by optimism on US jobs;;World stocks pushed higher and the yen sank as an encouraging report on the US labour market and a burst of merger and acquisition activity offered fresh reassurance to investors that the global recovery remained on track.The improvement in risk appetite came even as mounting concerns that Portugal might soon require financial assistance drove yields on the nation’s sovereign bonds to fresh euro-era highs.Peripheral eurozone debt will remain in the spotlight on Thursday with the publication of the results of a third round of stress tests on Irish banks.For now, though, equity markets remained content to focus on further signs of improvement in the US economy.ADP Employer Services said 201,000 private sector jobs had been created in March, in line with forecasts and bolstering hopes that Friday’s crucial non-farm payrolls report will show a continued recovery in the US labour market.Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said the focus on Friday would be on the unemployment rate rather than the non-farm payrolls number.“Given the remarkable drop in the unemployment rate over the past four months, players remain sceptical over the extent of the improvement and sensitive to historical revisions,” Mr Woolfolk said. “That said, strong ADP employment data over the past four months, amid very severe winter weather, suggests further improvement in underlying labour market conditions.”By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent, helped by takeover activity in the pharmaceutical sector. The CBOE Vix equity volatility index – watched by the markets as broad measure of risk aversion – fell 2.7 per cent.Positive sentiment on stocks was also evident elsewhere, with the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index up 0.8 per cent and the Nikkei 225 rising 2.6 per cent to its highest for two weeks, supported by the weaker tone of the yen.Indeed, the dollar broke back above Y83 – the level at which it was trading before a sharp post-earthquake sell-off in the pair – while the euro reached a 10-month high against the Japanese currency as yield differentials continued to drive the market.Rising US yields and a BoJ on easing bias points to higher levels of USD/JPY going forward.“Over the past few weeks, central bank rhetoric has stepped up with not only the European Central Bank hinting that a normalisation of monetary policy has drawn closer,” said Sverre Holbek, senior analyst at Danske Bank.“Hawkish comments particularly from the Federal Reserve’s [James] Bullard have triggered a sharp rise in US yields, the 10-year government yield gaining 35bp since the trough in mid-March. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan has responded to the weaker outlook for the Japanese economy by stepping up its quantitative easing further.”However, Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, said these moves suggested the yen could be on the cusp of a break into weaker ground, although she added: “The approach of fiscal year-end in Japan is not a good time to be talking about the potential for a new trend to emerge in the yen – particularly given the numerous times that the yen has disappointed investors’ expectations for a move lower.”Further hawkishness on US monetary policy came courtesy of Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Fed, who pledged to vote against further easing by the central bank.However, his comments did little to further unsettle the US government bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 4 basis points at 3.45 per cent before an auction of seven-year notes.In commodities, oil prices failed to rebound from early weakness to match equity markets’ advance, with Brent down 3 cents at $115.13. US crude futures underperformed after robust inventories data.Gold also reversed early losses to trade slightly higher at $1,422 an ounce, but copper fell to its lowest level for nearly two weeks,
422;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-03-24T22:40:19Z;Equities strengthen despite eurozone fears;;Gold prices hit an all-time high but global equities also rose as investors looked beyond eurozone debt woes, mixed US economic data and turmoil in the Middle East.“Investors appear well immunised to headlines about radiation risks and the rolling meltdown of eurozone peripheral debt markets,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at RBS Securities.The resilience of investors was illustrated by Portugal’s stock market rebounding sharply from a drop of more than 1 per cent in the wake of José Sócrates resigning as prime minister.While yields on Portugal’s government bonds rose to their highest levels since the launch of the euro, the collapse of the government is seen ultimately as leading to a bail-out package for the debt-laden country.“Markets are now expecting new elections and an eventual bail-out package,” said Gabriel Stein, director at Lombard Street Research. “That is a possible development. But there is also a possibility that Portugal could choose to bypass the bail-out and move straight to the default.”News from the eurozone remains unsettling as a two-day summit meeting for European leaders in Brussels, began on Thursday.Moody’s downgraded the senior debt and deposit ratings of 30 Spanish banks and LCH.Clearnet raised the margin that it requires for positions in Irish government bonds that are cleared through its Repo-Clear service.“The net result of this has been to turn the eurozone summit from an opportunity for the national leaders to soothe investor concerns to, instead, yet another test of nerves for those that continue to support the region’s sovereign debt markets,” said Simon Derrick, strategist at BNY Mellon.In economic news, US jobless claims fell 5,000 to 382,000, in line with estimates, while new orders for durable goods fell an unexpected 0.9 per cent in February rather than a forecast gain of 1.2 per cent.“The only comfort is that this weakness in the orders data is hard to square not just with the red-hot manufacturing survey evidence but also the encouraging manufacturing output figures over the past couple of months,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.At the close in New York, equity marketswere higher with the FTSE All-World index up 0.9 per cent. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to regain the 1,300 level.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 1 per cent, while Portugal’s PSI gained 1.1 per cent.Earlier, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Average slipped 0.2 per cent but shares in Australia rose 1.1 per cent.Trading in government bonds was focused on the eurozone and, aside from sharply higher yields in Portugal, the 10-year German Bund was steady at 3.24 per cent.The yield on US 10-year Treasury notes was 6 basis points higher at 3.41 per cent – the market failing to sustain a move below 3.30 per cent this week.“Although there are plenty of things to worry about, the bond market may have already priced in much of this, leading to the listless, shallow trading of the last few days,” said analysts at Nomura Securities.The euro was firmer in currency markets trading and rose above $1.42 versus the dollar, shrugging aside debt worries.The yen loitered around Y81 with traders wary of pushing the currency higher after last week’s intervention by central banks.Trading in commodities was marked by volatile swings in Brent crude oil, which approached $116 a barrel after an early drop to $114.50.In London, spot gold surged to a session high of $1,447.40 a troy ounce, up 0.8 per cent on the day, before gold futures retreated in late New York trade.
423;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-03-20T09:36:54Z;Partnership to be tested by alternatives directive;;The partnership prime brokers have enjoyed with custodians over the past three years will be tested under the European Union’s alternative investment fund managers (AIFM) directive.Since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, transaction-driven prime brokers and fee-based custodians have increased their business ties. Custodians are increasingly used to segregate “surplus” assets from assets held by prime brokers for trading-type activities.“That way the prime broker can concentrate on core competencies, such as trading and the financing of assets, while we focus on our core fiduciary responsibilities,” says David Aldrich, head of global client management for UK and Ireland at BNY Mellon.“We [custodians] are really partners with the whole street. We facilitate business.”However, these arrangements are soon to come under increased scrutiny, when depositories of alternative investment funds will be given new responsibilities and a higher level of liability.James Greig, a partner at PwC, says: “At the moment, quite a few funds don’t have a custodian. Under AIFM, you’ll have a situation where regulated funds are going to have to put a depository in place.“If I was a prime broker I’d think there is going to be reorganisation of that relationship because custodians will have various oversight responsibilities.”Although the AIFM directive looks a lot more favourable to depositories than at first thought, operating measures currently drawn up by the European Securities and Markets Authority are causing concern.Rob Moulton, a partner at law firm Ashurst, says: “This is one bit of the directive which unites the sell-side and the buy-side, that is worrying because of the impact it has on prime brokers.”Under the future directive, onshore hedge funds will need to have a depository, whose responsibility will be to keep assets safe.Depositories will have a purely fiduciary role, ensuring that everybody providing services to the fund, such as prime brokers, acts in a responsible way and that assets are correctly accounted for and do not go missing.Custodians initially feared they would have to take full liability for the loss of assets, but the directive eventually said that this liability could be delegated under certain circumstances.At the request of the European Commission, Esma is now establishing a list of events underpinning the contractual discharge of liability. This particular point may cause friction between prime brokers and custodians.“What should happen is the prime broker is responsible for the assets that it holds, and the depository is merely a supervisor and that we don’t take any liability,” says Mr Aldrich.“It’s a problem if we as depositories have to take liability in the event a prime broker goes bust. That would change the relationship we have today.”The Association of Global Custodians has asked Esma to exclude assets subject to securities loans, repos or other collateral arrangements, for example, from the scope of a depository’s safekeeping duties.On the other hand, prime brokers would prefer the regulator not to be too descriptive as to the “external events beyond reasonable control” under which depositories should not be held liable.If the regulator does not allow for flexibility, relations may well become a lot more difficult than they are now.“The depositories will be more cautious in dealing with prime brokers because they’ve taken such a great burden of liability, perhaps on the basis of a standard contract [drawn out by Esma].“The fear is it may mean that prime brokers have less flexibility on the terms on which they provide services to the funds,” says Mr Moulton.The other scenario would be that custodians refuse to take responsibility for assets held by external prime brokers because they believe the risk of liability is too high. Prime brokers may decide to start their own custody services.The head of European prime brokerage at one big US investment bank says: “If custodians decide they don’t want to work with any prime broker other than their own prime brokerage businesses, then it is kind of a threat to our business, and it means we have to have our own custody business.”That seems, however, rather unlikely at this stage.Although discussions will be expected at a commercial level on where the “liability buck stops”, prime brokers believe the regulator will try not to be too prescriptive in relation to sub-custody arrangements.The greater responsibilities put on the managers of alternative investment funds themselves could play a much bigger role in redefining the industry.
424;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-03-17T08:40:14Z;Yen jump justifies trader hyperbole;Japan’s central bank is unlikely to stay quiet;Currency traders are not usually short of adjectives, but for once the hyperbole reflected the reality on Wednesday as the yen shot up against the dollar. After breaking through Y80 to the dollar – already stronger than when the Bank of Japan intervened last September – the markets went berserk. They raced passed the previous record of Y79.75 set in 1995, after the Kobe quake. Then, in an extraordinary 20 minutes, the yen rose from Y79.50 to Y76.36 to the dollar.To put that in perspective, it means Japan’s economic output, assuming it remains at 2010 levels, would be worth $266bn more. Put another way, Japan went in 20 minutes from being the third-largest economy in the world to being the second-largest, taking the position back from China.The move was prompted by bets that Japanese investors and insurance companies would repatriate assets from overseas to pay for reconstruction (Japan is the world’s biggest creditor nation).Why now, though? Bank of New York Mellon, one of the largest custody banks, said it had seen no evidence of significant repatriation going on. Rather, when nothing was heard from the Bank of Japan after the Y80 level was breached, traders were emboldened to put on ever more aggressive bets.Meanwhile, those caught on the wrong side of the carry trade – borrowing cheaply in yen to buy overseas assets – rushed to buy yen to close out their positions, accelerating its rise. The yen’s vertical ascent is the equivalent of the flash crash in US equities last May. While technical factors are not identical, they share important features: a climate of fear in the market, lots of algorithmic traders and a fundamental logic for the direction of the move, if not the speed.Japan’s central bank is unlikely to stay quiet. Even if it does not intervene first thing on Thursday, which is possible, it is almost certain to try to talk down the yen. Whether it succeeds is of vital importance to Japan’s ability to rebuild, and to the world at large.
425;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-03-16T23:37:01Z;Yen hits postwar record against the dollar;;The yen soared to its highest level against the dollar since the second world war, as investors grew more confident that Japanese will sell foreign assets and bring money home for reconstruction efforts.Central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of Seven high-income countries were expected to hold a call as early as Thursday to discuss the impact of the Japanese earthquake on the global economy and markets.A G7 official said the call’s purpose was to take stock of the situation, rather than to consider any major initiatives such as intervention in the currency markets at this stage.The yen’s ascent on Wednesday was strongest toward the end of the New York afternoon. The yen officially closed in New York at a record Y79.57, slicing through its previous high of Y79.70 set in April 1995, and then rose in after-hours trading to Y76.36, up 6.4 per cent since Friday’s earthquake.The dramatic move so late in the session surprised investors and led to speculation that the Ministry of Finance would intervene by selling yen and buying dollars. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exporters, and Japan’s central bank is renowned for intervening to stop the yen from appreciating sharply.“To slice through this key level so easily is surprising,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank. “The silence from the BoJ so far may have encouraged the probing of the old record, but this feels more than speculative. It has a repatriation feel to it. Money needs to return.”The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent and turned negative for the year, after hefty falls in Europe. Safe-haven buying sent Treasury yields sharply lower.Bank of New York Mellon said on Wednesday that the yen’s rise could well spark a co-ordinated round of currency intervention by central banks for the first time in more than a decade.Mr Ruskin said: “It is a logical situation for Japan to have support from other central banks in a major currency intervention, given the current circumstances.”
426;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-03-08T22:25:46Z;Equities recover as oil price begins to ebb;Downgrade for Greece’s credit rating takes edge off oil price retreat;A retreat for crude oil prices as Opec moved to soothe concerns about production shortfalls in Libya helped US equities stage a strong rally and dented the haven appeal of gold and the Swiss franc.But even as worries about the impact on the global recovery of the recent surge in oil prices showed signs of easing – for now at least – eurozone sovereign debt concerns intensified in the aftermath of a Moody’s downgrade to Greece’s credit rating on Monday. According to Markit data, five-year Greek credit default swap spreads rose 8 basis points to 1,030bp, off an earlier wide.The yield on Greek 10-year government bonds jumped as much as 48bp to 12.82 per cent, Bloomberg data showed.Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, noted that the cost of insuring against a Greek sovereign debt default was now comparable with insuring against the same event in either Venezuela or Pakistan.“To place this in even starker context, it is worth recalling that the closing high for the cost of insuring against an Icelandic default during the very height of its crisis in 2008 only reached 1,100bp,” Mr Derrick said.“What is critical to note is that each time we reached precisely the current levels of stress in the CDS and eurozone fixed income markets over the course of the past year, the euro has typically started to come under substantial pressure.”Kathleen Brooks, of Forex.com, said: “Investors are running out of patience with the EU and if the leaders of the currency bloc can’t agree on a credible long-term solution to the fiscal issues facing some of the peripheral nations, then there is a risk that investors will take vengeance on the single currency.”The euro fell back from Monday’s four-month high against the dollar above $1.40, although analysts said its losses had been limited for now by yield differentials. The European Central Bank has signalled that it could raise interest rates as early as next month while the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its accommodative policy stance for some time to come.Elsewhere in the currency markets, the Swiss franc lost ground against the dollar as the pullback in oil prices helped quell a flight to safety.Similarly, gold fell to $1,427 a troy ounce from Monday’s record high above $1,444, while copper experienced a modest bounce back from two-week lows.Brent crude fell $1.98 a barrel to $113.06 – well down from last week’s 30-month intra-day high near $120 – while Nymex West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, eased a more modest 42 cents to $105.02.Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, raised his average forecast for Brent in the second quarter of 2011 to $122 a barrel from $86. “We believe prices could briefly break through $140 a barrel in the next three months,” he said.US equities put in a strong showing with the S&P 500 index up 0.9 per cent. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index overcame a bout of afternoon weakness to finish 0.3 per cent higher, while the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo managed a gain of 0.2 per cent.Emerging markets stocks rose 0.4 per cent. Noah Weisberger, strategist at Goldman Sachs, pointed out that emerging market equities had outperformed their developed market counterparts fairly steadily since mid-February. “However, the economic evidence that the EM growth/inflation trade-off has indeed shifted is still lacking,” he said. “Moreover, we are also reluctant to add directional equity risk in the current environment.”US government bondsfell after a sale of $32bn of three-year debt – the first sale of a total of $66bn of new supply this week. The 10-year Treasury yield was up 3bp at 3.54 per cent.
427;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Trichet’s ‘strong vigilance’ on inflation fuels euro’s advance;;The euro’s recent strong run on the back of interest rate rise speculation was vindicated this week after the European Central Bank indicated it would lift its main policy rate in the coming months.Up 1.8 per cent over the week against the dollar, the euro put on half of this in response to Thursday’s ECB press conference, which followed the governing council’s decision to hold the main rate at 1 per cent.Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, said that given the upside risks to inflation, “strong vigilance” was warranted – a phrase used throughout the bank’s 2005-08 rate-tightening cycle to pave the way for a rate increase at the next governing council meeting.“By dropping the view that the monetary stance was ‘appropriate’ and by stating that ‘strong vigilance’ was warranted, the financial markets now fully expect an April rate hike of 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent,” said Derek Halpenny at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi.And, given that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke in the Fed’s last policy statement continued with the line that economic trends warranted “exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period”, the euro remained well positioned for further gains against the dollar, analysts said.The market response to Friday’s non-farm payrolls data was muted, however. The report showed 192,000 jobs were created in the US in February and the jobless rate fell to 8.9 per cent from 9 per cent in January.Dollar losses continued, although the pace of selling slowed. Gains for the US currency have been rare in recent sessions, even though investors have been trading cautiously amid the Middle East unrest. This trend has led some to suggest the dollar has lost its haven appeal and investors are selling the currency to seek higher yields – the so-called carry trade.This trend has led some to suggest the dollar has lost its haven appeal and investors are selling the currency to seek higher yields – the so-called carry trade.By midday in New York, the euro was up 0.2 per cent to $1.3997, a rise of 1.8 per cent over the week. The single currency was up 0.7 per cent on the week to £0.8594 versus the pound and up 2.5 per cent to Y115.16 against the yen.The New Zealand dollar slid after John Key, prime minister, said he expected the Reserve Bank would cut interest rates at Wednesday’s meeting given the threat to economic growth caused by the damage wrought by last month’s earthquake.The Kiwi lost 1.9 per cent on the week against the US dollar to $0.7365, and is down 3.6 per cent since the February 22 quake.
428;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-27T20:15:06Z;Economic Outlook: Central banks to the fore;;Significant updates from US and European central bankers on extraordinary support for markets will jostle with US jobs and global manufacturing data to grab the attention of investors this week.The US non-farm payrolls due on Friday is viewed as the blockbuster release of the economic calendar, but has delivered an unpleasant surprise for four out of the past five months.This has led some to question its pre-eminence as a guide for markets, with various US economic indicators, including other employment gauges, showing a pick-up in the recovery.But in spite of its ability to confound forecasters, many are maintaining predictions of big non-farm payroll gains for February.“A variety of indicators suggest hiring picked up in recent months, but actual gains in payroll employment have been disappointing,” said HSBC analysts.“To the extent January’s reading was depressed by bad weather, the previous history of severe blizzards suggests a strong rebound is likely this month. We look for February non-farm payrolls to rise by 200,000.”The extent of the US recovery will provide the main backdrop on Wednesday to US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s two-day testimony to Congress on monetary policy.Any clues as to when the Fed’s Treasury purchase programme will be phased out will be closely scrutinised – although many expect Mr Bernanke to maintain a dovish tone.“While the appetite for a further round of asset purchases has clearly diminished, the cessation of QE2 will pose risks to growth just as the price of oil and declining government spending exact a growing toll on the economy,” said Neil Mellor of Bank of New York Mellon.Meanwhile on Thursday, the European Central Bank meets. “[This] looks set to be unusually interesting,” said Allan von Mehren of Danske Bank. “We will get to know if the ECB plans to continue with full allotments in its market operations.”Ben May of Capital Economics said: “[ECB President Jean-Claude] Trichet’s hawkish stance may harden but he is unlikely to go as far as preparing the ground for an imminent hike in interest rates. What’s more, the president will reiterate that the ECB’s government bond purchase programme is ongoing.”A raft of global manufacturing and service sector data are published this week, with UK eyes looking to see if services can retain its strong rebound last month.“We expect the services PMI to remain volatile, falling to 52.5 after surging to 54.5 in January,” said Amit Kara of UBS.
429;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-24T15:54:10Z;Quick View: A fly on the wall at Nasdaq;;There are many on Wall Street – and beyond – who would love to have been in Rich Repetto’s shoes this week.The analyst at Sandler O’Neill, a veteran observer of the exchanges industry, snagged a meeting with Nasdaq OMX top brass, giving him an inside peek at the group’s thinking just as everyone wants to know whether the group will make a grab for NYSE Euronext – or do something else, or do nothing at all.In a note to clients just published, Mr Repetto does not quite get the answer to those questions – at least not clear answers. Adena Friedman, the chief financial officer who quit unexpectedly last week, was not giving the game away.But he did glean some insights and, with the benefit of some interpretative context, had some very interesting things to say.First, people should not get hung up on the idea that Nasdaq may be looking at doing a single big deal, was one line. The group has a history of tackling quite complex deals involving a number of parties. For example, Mr Repetto cites a 2005 deal in which Nasdaq, Silver Lake, the private equity group, and Bank of New York teamed up to acquire Instinet, the broker. Nasdaq got the trading platform now known as Inet, Silver Lake acquired the agency brokerage operations of Instinet (later sold to Nomura in 2006), and Bank of New York bought Lynch, Jones & Ryan.As Mr Repetto put it: “Nasdaq does have in its DNA complex transactions from the past.”Second, the message seems to be that Nasdaq sees opportunity in consolidation (as opposed to threats), in particular in how long it will take some of the other deals out there to get regulatory approval. Not to mention “lengthy integrations”, as Mr Repetto noted.“Two businesses that were specifically mentioned were US options trading and market technology,” he wrote. “In US options, a consolidation of exchange ownership could lead to a recalibration of market share, plus there could be integration issues as Deutsche Börse has yet to transition International Securities Exchange to the Eurex platform (or NYSE Euronext’s ‘UTP’ technology following a merger).”As a third point, I would add that we need to look at Nasdaq’s shareholder base for some clues as to what might be in the works. On Wednesday Börje Ekholm, the chief executive of Investor, the holding company of Sweden’s Wallenberg family, joined the board of Nasdaq OMX as a new member.In December, when Nasdaq OMX was repurchasing shares from its largest shareholder Borse Dubai, Investor quietly raised its stake in Nasdaq OMX to over 10 per cent. That makes Investor the second largest shareholder in Nasdaq OMX after Dubai.Intriguingly, at the time Mr Ekholm said it was an attractive deal for Investor’s shareholders to become one of the biggest shareholders in Nasdaq OMX, which he said had “very strong market positions and a unique brand in the industry”.Like a Stieg Larsson novel, the plot thickens …
430;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-17T05:56:22Z;Moody’s says tri-party repo reform to reduce bank runs;;Reform of the US tri-party repurchase market this year should substantially reduce a repeat of the bank runs that severely impaired Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers during the financial crisis, said Moody’s in a report issued on Thursday.“The tri-party repo market faces a major overhaul in 2011,” said Alexander Yavorsky and Robert Young, analysts at Moody’s and authors of the report.“Successful reform will reduce dealers’ exposure to funding runs, their principal tail risk, which would be credit positive.”TRP was and remains a key source of funding used by banks and since September 2009, an industry task force sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been at work crafting reforms that are set to roll out this year.A TRP transaction involves using one of the two US clearing banks, Bank of New York Mellon or JPMorgan Chase to act as a custodian. One party lends money for a short period of time and receives securities pledged as collateral from the other party.In April 2008, TRP peaked at $2,800bn. Banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman were so heavily dependent on the market for daily financing needs that the sudden move by investors to pull their repo lending sparked a modern day bank run.That in turn revealed the vulnerability of the two clearing banks, who were left exposed to the vast repo positions held by dealers during the trading day.One of the key reforms of the TRP is ending the so-called “intra-day” unwind of all outstanding repo trades by the clearing banks which left them extending trillions of dollars in credit to the dealers. The sheer scale of that potential systemic risk prompted the Fed to demand the industry reform its practices.By June when the clearing banks roll out a new system known as “auto substitution”, the market hopes 20 to 30 per cent of the intra-day credit extension is eliminated, rising to 50 per cent soon after and approaching 90 per cent by August.“The ‘daily unwind’ and the related propensity of some investors to lend based on borrowers’ identity rather than according to the quality of their collateral are what cause repo runs,” said Moody’s.Members of the TRP taskforce say the main objective of reform is to remove the ambiguity as to who holds the risk in tri-party repo.“This entails making sure lenders of money in repo understand they are on the hook if a dealer runs into trouble and not a clearing bank,” said a repo market banker.Moody’s says one clear takeaway of reform is that: “Lenders will need to adjust their practices to shoulder 24-hour secured exposure to dealers.”While the TRP repo market has shrunk 40 per cent to $1,700bn since its peak, dealers still depend on repo for 60 per cent of their secured funding.While a majority of securities pledged as collateral are highly rated and liquid such as government bonds, 19 per cent of the market or $320bn of TPR collateral is inherently less liquid and more risky says Moody’s. At the market’s peak, 30 per cent of securities were less liquid and contributed to the run on dealers.Other TRP reforms include automating the trade confirmation process for more accurate accounting of repo agreements and a move to a single 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm daily trade settlement window for new and maturing trades.Also, clearing banks and dealers are negotiating secured credit facilities that will provide the dealers with a limited amount of credit to negotiate future repo volatility.Meanwhile, lenders in repo will be required to make the operational arrangements that can support an orderly liquidation or temporary funding of collateral in the event of dealer failure.
431;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-14T22:35:21Z;Egypt relief and recovery hopes lift stocks;Portuguese bond yields hit fresh highs;The easing of tensions in Egypt following the resignation of the country’s president and fresh optimism about the global recovery triggered a “relief rally” in Asian and European stock markets, but Wall Street showed signs of fatigue as caution set in after two successive weeks of gains.“Financial markets may be heaving a sigh of relief following the departure of Hosni Mubarak, but, in truth, it could be that recent events in north Africa have been but the first chapter in a story yet to unfold,” warned Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.Indeed, fears that unrest could spread from Egypt across the Middle East helped drive Brent crude to within a whisker of $104 a barrel and offered support to gold, said dealers.A further boost to oil and other industrial commodities came from data showing a surprise jump in Chinese copper imports last month. The copper price pushed back above $10,000 a tonne to trade close to last week’s record high of $10,160. Tin set a fresh peak.Optimism about the world economic outlook increased after news that China’s trade surplus had dropped to the lowest in nine months on the back of surging imports – highlighting an improvement in domestic demand. Meanwhile, rumours spread through the markets that Chinese consumer prices data, due out on Tuesday, would be significantly softer than the consensus forecast.Further positive news came from Japan, where the economy contracted by less than expected in the fourth quarter.The day’s data releases helped provide a strong boost to most Asian equity markets. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average climbed 1.1 per cent to a nine-month high, Shanghai rose 2.5 per cent – the biggest one-day gain for two months – and Mumbai jumped 2.7 per cent.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index touched a 29-month high in early trade but saw its advance dwindle to just 0.3 per cent by the close.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to a new 30-month peak. The Vix index of US equity volatility, watched by investors as a broad gauge of risk aversion, was up 1 per cent – but still remains close to a three-year low.Société Générale warned that risky assets were now technically vulnerable to a correction following their huge rally since September.“Risky assets have benefited from extremely positive newsflow over the past six months,” said Alain Bokobza, SG’s head of global asset allocation. “Equities and commodities have already priced in a huge part of the positive macro newsflow. The upside potential on some risky assets is more limited in the short term, and the probability of a technical correction is increasing.”A reminder of a potential headwind to risk assets came from a jump in Portuguese government bonds yields to a fresh euro-era record, amid new concerns that Lisbon might be forced to seek international financial assistance.The jump in borrowing costs came as EU finance ministers gathered in Brussels to discuss ways of strengthening the region’s rescue fund. But analysts were sceptical.“Hopes are shattering that the leaders have any sort of agreeable plan to keep deficit reduction plans intact,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.Adding to the sense of European fragility were reports that individual nations were struggling with the terms of agreed bail-outs.The darker mood surrounding the eurozone helped drive the euro to a three-week low against the dollar, with the single currency markets further unsettled by rumours that the rescue of German state-owned bank WestLB was in trouble.The euro also fell against the yen and Swiss franc.
432;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-08T22:53:34Z;South Korea’s won gains ground on dollar;South Korean won hit highest level against dollar since financial crisis;The South Korean won hit its highest level against the dollar since the onset of the financial crisis amid increased speculation that emerging market central banks – especially in Asia – will allow their currencies to appreciate to fight inflationary pressures.South Korea’s government has stepped up its fight against inflation while the Bank of Korea has raised interest rates since they hit a low of 2 per cent last summer by 75 basis points in an attempt to rein in rising price pressures.Many analysts expect the central bank to deliver a further 25bp interest rate rise after its policy meeting on Friday.Neil Mellor, of Bank of New York Mellon, said the BoK would be aware that raising interest rates would have a limited effect in addressing short-term inflationary pressures compared with currency appreciation.“With exports growing at a record pace in December, the country could certainly tolerate a stronger won,” he said. “Although, the BoK has been reluctant to allow the won to move back towards its 2010 highs above Won1,100 against the dollar, this may now be its most prudent option if it is to win its battle against inflation.”The won rose to a high of Won1,101.90 against the dollar on Tuesday, its strongest level since September 2008. Traders noted strong demand from hedge funds.The Taiwan dollar rose through the T29 level against the dollar, which the country’s central bank has been defending for a month, to rise 0.4 per cent to a 13-year high of T$28.897.The Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso rose to three-month highs of Rp8,920 and 43.40 pesos, respectively, against the dollar.Commodity-linked currencies remained resilient despite the People’s Bank of China delivering its second interest rate rise in more than six weeks.After an initial drop on fears of reduced Chinese demand for raw material, the Australian dollar climbed 0.1 per cent to $1.0147 against the dollar while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.6 per cent to $0.7742. The Canadian dollar fell 0.5 per cent to C$0.9956.
433;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-02T22:38:25Z;Egypt clashes fail to halt equities’ march;;Pitched battles on the streets of Cairo took the edge off a wave of euphoria sweeping through financial markets as dollar bears were forced on to the back foot and global stocks still climbed to 30-month highs.The dollar bounced back after hitting a three-month low in early trading against a basket of major currencies while the FTSE All-World equity index gained 0.2 per cent to reach levels not seen since August 2008.Euro-area bulls saw clouds gather after a session that had begun positively with a successful auction of short-term Portuguese debt, and eurozone peripheral bond yields shrugging off an S&P downgrade of Ireland’s sovereign rating.But disagreements over how Europe’s bail-out fund could be strengthened were highlighted by reports that a German government official had ruled out a move involving the fund buying the bonds of the debt-laden peripheral nations.Despite a gradual easing in the day’s risk-on mood, Michael Woolfolk, of Bank of New York Mellon, said: “Nothing [on Wednesday] suggests a material change in risk appetite with emerging-market currencies holding up admirably under the stress of the Egypt crisis.”He noted that markets were focusing on “more pressing issues” on the eve of a key European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, where a more hawkish tone could signal clues as to the fate of the dollar and the euro for the rest of the year.“Thursday’s press conference by [ECB president Jean-Claude] Trichet may prove to be the event of the week with the market raising its expectations of an ECB rate hike by mid-year.“If so, US dollar short positions are likely to increase, with the [US Federal Reserve] expected to maintain zero interest rates through year-end.”Adding to the ECB’s rate-rise dilemma on Wednesday were eurozone producer prices rising more than expected in December, pointing to growing inflationary pressures in the pipeline.In the currency markets the dollar rebounded from a sustained 36-hour beating to make its first gains against the euro in three days while the US dollar index sprang back from three-month lows to edge into positive territory for the session.Rising expectations of a UK interest rate rise fed into broad gains for sterling, supported by UK-US two-year government bond yield spreads hitting their widest level for two years.There was a calm reaction to S&P’s downgrade of Ireland’s debt to A minus from A on relief that the cut was only one notch, a move largely priced in by markets.Irish 10-year yields fell 19 basis points while Portugal’s dropped 8bp after a sale of €1.2bn of T-bills with lower borrowing costs than recent auctions.Yields of 10-year US Treasuries climbed for a third day, up 6bp, as a fresh wave of supply of $72bn in notes and bonds was announced for next week. Two-year yields reached their highest level for three weeks after rising 6bp.In equity markets Asia benefited from the early spike in risk appetite, with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average making its strongest gains for two months.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 edged higher on strength for mining stocks while Wall Street profit-taking saw the S&P 500 edge lower but maintain the 1,300 plateau hit after the stellar gains of the previous session.US investors reacted cautiously to a stronger-than-expected rise in private sector jobs for January in ADP report data.“ADP has not been a particularly good payrolls predictor recently,” said Rob Carnell of ING, referring to the more comprehensive US non-farm payrolls employment report due on Friday.In commodity markets, Brent crude oil prices hit new a 28-month high of $102.59, while copper hit a record of $9,988.25 a tonne, although an assault on $10,000 faded as it fell back towards Tuesday’s closing levels. Gold was weaker on the lack of haven buying.
434;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Inflation threat pushes dollar to two-month low;;The dollar came under pressure, dropping to a two-month low against a basket of currencies as political unrest in the Middle East focused investor attention on global inflationary pressures.Simon Derrick, of Bank of New York Mellon, said one catalyst for the action had been rising food prices, and inflationary pressures were only likely to rise as developing countries stockpiled food supplies as a consequence of the unrest.Mr Derrick said as the threat of rising inflation heightened, investors were likely to be attracted to currencies of central banks that, unlike the US Federal Reserve, were likely to raise interest rates to fight increasing price pressures. Indeed, after a surge higher on Friday as news of the turmoil in Egypt sparked haven demand for the dollar, investors quickly unwound those positions.“It is entirely logical that, after people thought things through over the weekend, it was the dollar they were selling,” said Mr Derrick.The dollar index, which tracks its progress against a basket of six leading currencies, fell 1 per cent to 76.943, its weakest level since November 9.The dollar also dropped to two-month lows against the euro and sterling, with speculation over the prospect of higher interest rates in the UK and the eurozone intensifying after strong surveys of manufacturing activity in both regions.“The mere expectation that the European Central Bank, and also the Bank of England, are likely to be tightening rates ahead of the Federal Reserve is giving their respective currencies a lift,” said Michael Derks of FxPro.The dollar fell 1 per cent to $1.3834 against the euro, breaching the $1.38 mark for the first time since November. It lost 0.8 per cent to $1.6148 against the pound and fell 0.8 per cent to Y81.36 against the yen.The dollar fell more sharply against the Australian dollar, by 1.4 per cent to $1.0117, after the Reserve Bank of Australia was less dovish than expected after its policy meeting. It played down the long-term effects of the floods, raising expectations that rates would rise again in the coming months.
435;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-01T19:57:49Z;BlackRock founder to gain $13m in stock;;BlackRock has awarded Larry Fink, its founder and chief executive, $13m in restricted stock and options in a further sign that financial companies are moving away from the relative frugality of the financial crisis.The stock award, which forms part of Mr Fink’s bonus for 2010, comes after a year spent integrating the $13.5bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors to create the world’s largest money manager by assets.The award, disclosed in a filing on Monday night, consists of 46,031 restricted shares and 18,712 options vesting over three years, more than double the $6m worth of restricted stock Mr Fink received in 2009.It follows full-year results, reported last week, where BlackRock reported net income, adjusted for non-recurring items such as integration costs, up 110 per cent on the year before to $2,139bn.Mr Fink now controls 1.4m shares in the asset manager, a stake worth $273m at Monday’s close.During 2010, however, the BlackRock share price fell 18 per cent, sharply underperforming the broader market as investor expectations for improvement in margins due to the BGI merger were lowered.While the cash component of Mr Fink’s cash compensation will be disclosed in the company’s annual proxy statement, an increase on the $15.8m he received in 2009 is still likely to be below that awarded at the peak of the market.In 2007, Mr Fink received a total of $41.9m in restricted stock, options cash and long-term incentive awards.Since then, the company is considered to have weathered the financial crisis well.BlackRock did not take bail-out cash and its technology consultancy arm is now used by the US, UK and Irish governments to monitor portfolios of toxic assets acquired in the course of bank rescues.Mr Fink also steered the company to acquire BGI in late 2009, beating off competition from BNY Mellon to create a group that now has $3,561bn in assets under management.The improved bonus is the latest sign that financial groups globally are beginning to shake off the scrutiny and criticism of executive pay, which they attracted in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Last week, Goldman Sachs trebled the annual salary of its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, to $2m, and awarded him $12.6m in restricted stock, up from $9m the year before.Citigroup has raised its chief executive, Vikram Pandit’s salary from $1 to $1.75m. Bank of America awarded Brian Moynihan $9.1m in restricted stock, but tied his 2010 bonus to the company’s performance over the next four years, requiring the bank to remain profitable for the award to vest.The rewards still pale compared to that earned by the most successful fund managers. John Paulson, manager of the Paulson & Co funds, is estimated to have increased his wealth by more than $5bn in 2010.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
437;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-02-01T19:52:08Z;Gilt yields jump on inflation fears;;Gilt yields have jumped to their highest in eight months, making UK government debt western Europe’s worst performing sovereign bond market this year.Amid worries over the combined threat of inflation and slow growth in the UK, some strategists have warned that gilts will sell off further. They fear international investors will offload gilts because of inflationary pressures and concern about sterling.In spite of these doubts, international investors have still been buying gilts in record amounts, according to the latest figures from the Bank of England.Ten-year gilt yields jumped to 8-month highs on Tuesday and sterling rose against the euro and the dollar, after strong manufacturing numbers brought forward expectations of interest rate rises to June.Markets expect the Bank of England will raise interest rates, in at least two quarter percentage-point moves, by the end of the year to head off the threat of higher inflation.Longer-term concerns centre on the threat of so-called “stagflation”, where inflation rises while growth fails to pick up, which, in turn, could hit the pound.Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said: “Higher inflation and slow growth could hurt sterling. We could see stagflation lite.”John Wraith, fixed income strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, said: “If overseas investors thought inflation was not going to moderate beyond the near term, their appetite for gilts would diminish and it would devalue the currency.”Gilts have seen total returns of minus 1.9 per cent since the start of the year, the worst performance among Europe’s leading industrialised economies.The peripheral markets of Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland have seen the best performance amid improving sentiment in the eurozone.In spite of the jump in 10-year yields to 3.70 per cent, strategists said they did not yet see any signs that international investors were shunning the market.Overseas investors bought another £8bn in gilts in December to take net purchases for last year to £79bn, 43 per cent of the overall amount of government bonds sold, and a record for a calendar year.The percentage of gilts owned by international investors has jumped sharply in the past year as foreign investors have been reassured by the government’s tough crackdown on spending to restore public finances. This has eased fears that the UK could lose its top-notch triple-A credit status.International investors have also bought more gilts as they see the UK as a haven outside of the troubled eurozone.Strategists say international investors are now buying the bulk of short and medium term gilts of maturities between one and 15 years. The UK Debt Management Office sold £183.2bn of gilts last year, of which £105bn was in short and medium dated bonds.See Trading Post
438;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-01-28T23:30:18Z;BNY Mellon faces two lawsuits;Bank faces two unrelated lawsuits from South Carolina and Virginia;BNY Mellon faces two unrelated lawsuits from South Carolina and Virginia accusing the New York-based bank of mismanagement of investments and false reporting of trades.The South Carolina State Treasurer Curtis Loftis is seeking to recover about $200m in damages for BNY Mellon’s alleged failure to adhere to investment guidelines in a securities lending programme.In Virginia, Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli is intervening in an existing suit against BNY Mellon to represent the interests of the Virginia Retirement System and other local government retirement funds.“We believe the lawsuits are without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously”, said a spokesperson for BNY Mellon.In an action filed in a South Carolina court on Wednesday, Treasurer Loftis accused the bank of making bad investments with revenue received from securities lending.“Our contract called for investments limited to conservative, high quality instruments,” he said. “The bank inappropriately invested in mortgage backed securities comprised of subprime mortgages”.The lawsuit claims that BNY Mellon invested in mortgage backed securities with maximum maturity dates of up to 30 years, when loan agreements required terms of three years or less.The bank also invested in debt instruments of the now bankrupt Lehman Brothers, said Treasurer Loftis.The Virginia case was originally filled in Fairfax County Circuit Court in October 2009 by a whistleblower, FX Analytics, and was this week unsealed by a judge.It concerns BNY Mellon’s role as master custodian of the $55bn Virginia Retirement System since 1998.The bank is paid an annual fee of about $4.5m for this service, according to the office of the Virginia attorney general.The complaint alleges that in the course of buying and selling foreign currency for the pension funds, BNY falsely reported the exchange rate at which trades occurred.Since at least 2000, BNY used this false reporting to mark up or down the price at which trades occurred, keeping the difference so profiting at the expense of its clients, the complaint said.BNY Mellon is the world’s largest custodian, with $25,000bn assets under custody or administration.The suits come as states are under pressure to plug gaps in public finances at the same time as many state pension plans face underfunding and require additional contributions.Concerns about defaults in the $3,000bn municipal bond market have led to record selling by retail investors and a jump in borrowing costs.
439;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-01-24T20:55:52Z;Gold’s broken link with the euro;;Those who bought gold as a store of value have had their faith tested this year as the price fell more than 5 per cent to $1,346 an ounce.What is odd is that gold has, roughly, been tracking the euro in reverse. As the euro strengthened, the yellow metal weakened, and vice versa. The pattern has held since mid-November, after the US Federal Reserve restarted quantitative easing, buying US Treasuries.This reversed the way gold has moved for most of the past eight years, when a stronger euro meant stronger gold.That link broke down twice: in 2005 and again last year, up to August. In 2005 the Fed was hiking rates steadily. But until August last year the eurozone crisis helped gold and the euro move inversely – as they have again moved since November.Untangling the reasons is tricky. All else equal, an asset’s value in dollars should go up when the dollar falls, so the long-running link between the euro and gold makes sense. Equally, the Greek – and more recently Irish – crises meant that those seeking safety were dumping the euro and buying gold simultaneously.There is more to it than this, though. Exchange rates are closely tied to interest rates, particularly short bond yields. Gold, too, is closely connected to real interest rates, the income foregone by buying a lump of metal.Put the two together and gold and the euro should be linked when US rates are too low for comfort. As Simon Derrick of Bank of New York Mellon points out, this is also the time when investors worry about the dollar. Since 2002, gold and the euro have looked like good alternatives – broken only by the 2005 rate hikes and eurozone panics.Growing confidence that Germany is willing to fix the eurozone’s problems helped the euro strengthen to almost $1.37 on Monday, passing its level the day the Fed started QE2. Gold also rose. If eurozone problems really are being dealt with, a stronger euro could mean stronger gold once again.
440;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-01-19T21:54:25Z;Financials lead US equities lower;;Financial stocks fell after disappointing results from Goldman Sachs weighed on the wider markets while strong performances by Apple and IBM failed to stem the losses.Goldman reported a 52 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit, sending shares in the investment bank down 4.7 per cent to $166.49.This dragged on the financial sector, prompting fears that the earnings results of other major US banks would also fail to live up to expectations.Morgan Stanley, which will report fourth-quarter results on Thursday, was down 3.5 per cent to $27.75 while Bank of America Merrill Lynch, reporting on Friday, was down 4.2 per cent to $14.37. The S&P financials index dropped 2.2 per cent to 218.92.Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo also disappointed investors with fourth-quarter earnings. It reported profits slightly below expectations at 54 cents a share compared to the 57 cents per share expected by analysts, sending shares down 1.7 per cent to $31.58.Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest bank in the US, reported a profit of $3.41bn, up from $2.82bn a year earlier. This was broadly in line with analyst expectations but the stock still lost 2 per cent to $31.81 in line with the rest of the sector.Last week, JPMorgan posted strong results, raising expectations that other banks would follow suit. But Citigroup posted weak fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, sending financial stocks lower and adjusting market expectations.Many investors remain confident that upcoming results from the major US banks will still be strong.“Our view is there will be more surprises on the upside than the downside in coming weeks,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management.Losses for financials led the S&P 500 to close 1 per cent lower to 1,281.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent to 11,825.29 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.5 per cent to 2,725.36.Strong results from Apple failed to protect the stock from another day of losses after news on Monday that Steve Jobs, chief executive officer, was taking a medical leave of absence.Apple was lifted to all-time highs after it posted bumper first-quarter earnings figures.Apple reported earnings of $6.43 a share, beating the $5.39 a share consensus forecasts. The results were a sharp increase on the $3.67 a share earned in the first quarter last year.But later in the day the stock turned into negative territory as traders booked profits and turned their attention once again to the imminent absence of Mr Jobs. Apple closed down 0.5 per cent to $338.84.This weighed on the S&P technology index, which fell 1.2 per cent to 456.23.IBM was one of the few major technology stocks to gain in the session after posting strong fourth-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday, which exceeded analysts’ expectations.Shares in the world’s largest computer services provider were up 3.4 per cent to $155.69.Dell, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are all due to report in the coming weeks. Data from the Commerce Department for December showed a sharp decline in the number of new houses being built, which also helped to weigh on investor sentiment.Figures showed that an annual rate of 529,000 new homes were started in December from the 555,000 in November, falling short of median forecasts.“This is consistent with reports that homebuilder confidence remains severely depressed, indicating financial distress on the part of many households,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.But the economic data were mixed as the number of new building permits rose 16.7 per cent to an annual rate of 635,000 in December compared with 544,000 the prior month.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Northern Trust, the Chicago-based bank, fell 5.7 per cent to $52.49 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of $157.1m, down from the $200.3m in the same period last year.Hudson City Bancorp, the New Jersey regional bank, saw the sharpest losses on the S&P index after reporting profit down 11 per cent to $121.2m. The stock lost 6.5 per cent to $12.04.American Express fell 2.4 per cent to $45.24 after the credit card company said it was cutting 550 jobs and that it expected fourth-quarter earnings to fall slightly short of Wall Street’s estimates.
441;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-01-12T21:52:11Z;US equities rise as eurozone fears subside;;US equities climbed to fresh two-year highs led by ITT after the manufacturing company announced plans to split into three publicly traded companies.ITT, which makes water pumps and night vision goggles, rose 16.5 per cent to $61.50 on news it was spinning off its water and defence businesses.The streamlined ITT will have sales of $2.1bn in 2011, while the defence company will have sales of $5.8bn and the water technology business may generate $3.6bn, the company said in a statement.The news lifted related industrial stocks, with Tyco International up 1.5 per cent to $43.85. The S&P Industrials index was up 0.9 per cent to $308.52.But the best performing stocks were in the financial sector, which helped lift the S&P 500 to two and a half year highs, rising 0.9 per cent to 1,285.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 to 11,755.44, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,737.33, a three-year high.JPMorgan Chase saw one of the strongest gains in the financial sector after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, said he wanted to boost the company’s dividend in the second quarter of 2011.Mr Dimon said a dividend rise could come after the Federal Reserve’s “stress tests” on major US banks to ensure they have sufficient capital reserves.“We will be adequately capitalised even in a stressed situation, so when they finish these tests we’re hopeful we’ll be allowed to go back to paying normal dividends,” he said.JPMorgan rose 2.5 per cent to $44.71, one of the biggest gainers on the BKX bank index, although these gains were pared somewhat by news that Goldman Sachs had downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “overweight”. Elsewhere in the financial sector, the Bank of New York Mellon was up 2.4 per cent to $31.44 while Morgan Stanley rose 2.1 per cent to $28.56.Financials were also lifted by news that Portugal had successfully issued debt in a bond auction. This success limited the short-term pressure on Portugal to accept a bail-out, which could have severe consequences for the European banking sector and therefore by extension US financial stocks. But some commentators warned a bail-out was still a risk.Financial stocks were still the best performing on Wall Street, however. The S&P Financials index closed up 1.7 per cent to 222.49, also helped by a ratings upgrade of the US banking sector by Wells Fargo, which moved the sector to “overweight” from “market weight”.Analysts at Wells Fargo said that dividend payout ratios in the US banking sector “should double” in 2011 from 14 per cent to between 25 and 30 per cent.Oil and gas stocks continued to rise in the session after the price of oil neared $100 a barrel due to supply disruptions in the North Sea and Alaska, as well as more general optimism on the global economic recovery in 2011.The S&P Oil and Gas index was up 2 per cent to 582.49, led by Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, which gained 2.7 per cent to $84.45.The index has now risen 54.8 per cent since the start of September when oil prices began to rise steeply.Chevron, the second-biggest oil company in the US, was up 0.7 per cent to $92.45 after it said its fourth-quarter earnings were expected to be higher than in the previous quarter, largely due to higher oil prices.St Jude Medical, the medical device maker, rose 1.9 per cent to $41.73 after the company said it expected its fourth-quarter earnings figures to be at the top end of its previous estimates of between 72-74 cents a share.LeapFrog Enterprises, the educational toy maker, fell 22.3 per cent to $4.22 after warning its current-year earnings results would fall short of expectations. Bill Chiasson, chief executive, said in spite of a “solid start to the holiday season”, consumer “demand softened late in the quarter relative to our expectations”.AK Steel was the biggest loser on the S&P, falling 2.4 per cent to $15.23 after UBS downgraded the stock to “sell” from “neutral”.Campbell Soup, the world’s largest soup maker, rose 1 per cent to $34.92 after announcing a joint venture with Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong conglomerate, in order to develop the company’s soups in China. Campbell Soup will own a 60 percent stake in Campbell Swire, which will begin operating this year.In base metals Cliffs Natural Resources rose 4.1 per cent to $88.43 after agreeing to acquire Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines of Canada in a friendly all-cash C$4.9bn deal.
442;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-01-10T01:32:11Z;US banks face fresh stress tests;;Large US financial groups are bracing for a new battery of stress tests that will determine which institutions are now healthy enough to raise dividends and buy back shares.The Federal Reserve is expected this week to begin examining data provided by 19 groups, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, to gauge how their balance sheets would withstand a variety of new economic and financial shocks.The exercise, mirroring the tests of May 2009 when the sector was reeling from the crisis, comes as investors have been pressing banks to return part of their surging profits.The calls have gone unanswered, contributing to the low valuation of many bank stocks, because after injecting billions of dollars to recapitalise the sector, regulators have been wary of sanctioning capital returns.“[Their] tough line is a sign of their new assertiveness,” said a Wall Street executive. “They are taking over duties once reserved to management and boards.”Officials are expected to complete the tests by March, paving the way for the first batch of dividend rises and share buy-backs in the second quarter.The Fed has sought to draw a distinction between the new tests and their 2009 counterparts, telling institutions to consider the latest demand for data as part of a new world of regular testing that does not contain a “pass or fail”. The results will not be made public.Only banks that have repaid government bail-outs and can prove a lifted dividend will not compromise their safety will be allowed to return cash to investors. The Fed will also decide whether banks are on course to meet more stringent rules on capital requirements, agreed by the international Basel committee last year.Last year’s stress tests on the banks, which helped reassure markets of the solvency of US institutions, are being widely seen as the model.“We expect higher dividends – we estimate twice as high in 2011 from the low 2010 levels – and more buy-backs,” wrote Deutsche Bank analysts.Analysts expect healthier banks, such as Goldman, JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon, to be among the first allowed to return capital to shareholders.The groups to be tested are: Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, GMAC, American Express, PNC, Regions Financial, SunTrust, Fifth Third Bancorp, KeyCorp, MetLife, BNY Mellon, Capital One, US Bancorp, State Street and BB&T.The 19 financial groups that underwent the 2009 tests had until Friday to submit new data to the Fed, including a forecast of how they would weather another economic downturn.Bankers said the Fed asked banks for two-year simulations on two scenarios: one in which the economy suffered a mild downturn and a more severe one marked by a sharp rise in unemployment and a tumble in housing prices.US banks are generally well-placed to meet the new Basel rules, which include a minimum capital ratio of 7 per cent common equity to risk-weighted assets. But the biggest banks are likely to have to exceed that new metric and the Fed is looking for prudent capital conservation.
443;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2011-01-05T16:17:22Z;Australian dollar faces mounting risks;;Investors should be cautious about viewing the Australian dollar’s weakening as a buying opportunity, says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He points out that the currency was one of 2010s star performers, hitting a 28-year high against the US dollar on the back of attractive interest rates and an accommodative global environment for commodities.As such, Mr Mellor says, the greatest risks to the Aussie in 2011 would appear to stem from tighter Chinese monetary policy and more signs of economic improvement in the US. But he also warns that developments closer to home pose a more immediate risk of further weakening.He points to fears that the recent floods in Queensland could have a significant direct impact on industry, and exports in particular. Moreover, he says, the Aussie’s strength has hit non-commodity exporters – and he warns there is little sign of a marked improvement in domestic demand.“Higher mortgage rates in 2010 have imposed an increasing strain on household finances, so the fear is that growth might yet stall,” he says.“While it is difficult to be overly pessimistic about the Aussie’s fortunes, there are genuine causes for concern. As such, we would wait to see how the currency fares in its battle to retain parity against the US dollar before giving in to the temptation of buying back in.”
444;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-12-30T23:06:01Z;Weak dollar hints at action to curb yen;;The dollar lost ground against the yen for the ninth session in the past 10, raising speculation that Japan might be forced to intervene once again to stem the rise in its currency.Late in New York, the yen was up 0.9 per cent to Y81.61 against the dollar, within striking distance of the 15-year high of Y80.22 that it hit in October and the record peak of Y79.70 it struck in 1995.The move has not been missed by officials in Tokyo, with Yoshihiko Noda, finance minister, observing that, while trade had been thin during the past week, it had also been “one-sided”.“I will closely watch market moves towards the year-end and new year,” said Mr Noda. “Our stance remains unchanged that we will take decisive steps when rapid moves occur.”Japan spent Y2,125bn ($24.7bn) intervening to stem the rise in the yen and support its exporters in the month to September 28. The ministry of finance spent Y1,660bn on September 15, the largest day of intervention in its history.The usually tight correlation between a rise in the dollar against the yen and a rise in US government bond yields over their Japanese counterparts had broken down in recent weeks, said Neil Mellor, of Bank of New York Mellon.He said that breakdown could prompt Japan back into the foreign exchange market to suppress the value of the yen.Mr Mellor said the new situation reflected concerns over the fiscal situation in the US, with rising US bond yields a reflection of increased concerns over the country’s finances rather than confidence in US growth.“All evidence appears to point to the probability that, once the concerns surrounding the eurozone begin to ease, then the focus for the markets will switch very firmly back to the dollar’s very serious shortcomings,” he said.“Indeed, with President Obama’s extended tax cuts a source of dismay in the US Treasury market, it cannot be assumed that a further backing up in bond yields will continue to be supportive of the dollar against the yen.”The yen was steady at Y107.99 against the euro and little changed at Y126.55 against the pound late in New York.Commodity-linked currencies advanced as raw material prices continued to surge. The Australian dollar rose 0.8 per cent to $1.0180 against the US dollar and the New Zealand dollar climbed 1.6 per cent to $0.7673.Elsewhere, the dollar extended losses in New York and eased 0.9 per cent to $1.3230 against the euro, lost 0.9 per cent to $1.5504 against the pound and was 0.7 per cent weaker at SFr0.9457 against the Swiss franc.

446;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Risk appetite rises as fears on China fade;Oil jumps as Opec promises on targets;Risk assets began the week on the front foot. Equities climbed, copper hit a record high and traditional havens such as government debt, the dollar and the yen sold off as bulls took charge of a rally.December is traditionally a strong month for stocks but it was weekend policy events in China that provided the dog that did not bark for global markets.“China’s strong economic data and a lack of an interest rate hike by the People’s Bank of China this weekend has given risky assets a spring to their step at the start of the week,” said Kathleen Brooks of Forex.com.Expectations of a rise in Chinese interest rates had risen strongly and reached a crescendo last week when Beijing announced that it was bringing forward its announcement of November inflation figures.Although the weekend’s data revealed a jump to a 28-month peak of 5.1 per cent, there was no further dramatic monetary tightening moves from Beijing after Friday’s rise in bank reserve ratio requirements. “The RRR rate seems to be [Beijing’s] policy tool of choice rather than interest rate hikes or renminbi appreciation,” noted Ms Brooks.Neil Mellor, of Bank of New York Mellon, said: “Of course, the reason the PBoC has resisted hiking interest rates is simple: to do so is to encourage capital flows. But whether interest rates are employed or not, one thing is now certain: more austere policy tightening is in the pipeline for sure.”Joshua Raymond, of City Index, said: “However, for now, investors are betting that any fiscal tightening may not be a sudden and sharp process.” He noted that this optimism underpinned Monday’s surge in risk appetite. But analysts cautioned that technical factors could limit a Christmas bull market.Ben Potter, of IG Markets, said: “With this being the last full trading week of the year, position keeping is now going to start creeping into markets and, despite the lure of any rally, traders will be mindful in keeping one eye on the scope for diminishing risk appetite and profit-taking.”Last week’s sharp sell-off in core government bonds, which saw 10-year US Treasury yields soar 31 basis points, continued in early trading as the US benchmark yields hit a seven-month peak of 3.395 per cent.“Monday is proving to be another tough start to the week for bond investors,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers.“A theme of more solid recovery continues to bolster demand for stocks and commodities and at the same time reduce the need for the traditional safe haven status of bonds.”But Julian Jessop, of Capital Economics, questioned whether it represented the start of a prolonged bear market for bonds.He noted that markets were simply readjusting to growing optimism over the US economy, higher expectations for US inflation and a more downbeat reassessment of further quantitative easing from the US Federal Reserve, which is set to begin its last policy meeting of the year on Tuesday.“Provided, as we expect, the economic recovery ultimately disappoints and the Fed keeps short-term interest rates near zero, 10-year yields are likely to drop back to 2.5 per cent as deflation fears return [next year],” added Mr Jessop.By mid-afternoon in New York, yields on 10-year Treasuries had reversed course to fall 2bp to 3.29 per cent while 10-year Bunds were flat at 2.97 per cent.In currency markets, the havens of the dollar and yen came under pressure, the US currency falling 1 per cent against the euro and 0.3 per cent against the yen, which itself was 0.7 per cent weaker against the euro.Risk appetite currencies advanced, the Australian dollar climbing 0.9 per cent against the US currency.The bullishness was most marked in equity markets with the Shanghai Composite surging 2.9 per cent, its best performance in two months, lifting the FTSE All-World index by 0.9 per cent.Both European and Wall Street stocks achieved two-year-plus peaks.In commodity markets, copper surged to a record of $9,235.25 before easing back slightly to advance 2.3 per cent on the day while oil prices jumped after producer cartel Opec agreed to maintain output targets.
447;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-12-12T23:43:21Z;Shake-up for dull world of transaction banking;;Transaction banking is one of those dreadful financial labels that gives little clue as to what it is. But that has not stopped the lowbrow businesses it em­braces – cash management, trade finance, securities custody and card payments – from becoming high fashion in the post-crisis world.The reason is simple. “Even when economic conditions are weak, transaction banking can still generate relatively stable revenues from fees,” says Brian Stevenson, head of global transaction services at Royal Bank of Scotland. And that, he says, made it important to banks as they retreated from some of the more volatile areas of investment banking .“This business has been seen as a low priority for years,” says Francesco Burelli, a principal at consultancy Value Partners. “Until the crisis, a lot of banks were even questioning whether they should do it at all. Now, all of a sudden, transaction bankers are in expansion mode.”The steady transaction-based fees make it low-risk, and thanks to the relatively low levels of capital needed to sustain it, it is high-profit, typically generating a return on equity of 50 to 100 per cent, according to some bankers.But the question many are asking now is whether the tougher competitive landscape – as more banks are drawn to the business – and a more costly regulatory environment will spoil the financial appeal of transaction banking. Last week, attention was drawn to the potential risks in custody services by the $6.6bn lawsuit targeted at HSBC by the trustee of the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. Could such worries undermine the broader appeal of transaction banking?It is impossible to pin down precise growth or profit numbers for the industry. Specialists have clearly been booming. State Street’s “investment servicing” business has been generating profits of $2bn-$3bn over the past few years, dwarfing the group’s asset management business and accounting for virtually all of group profits. “The revenue base is quite stable,” says Tim Keaney, chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Servicing. “We keep clients each year. That is a very different business from investment banking where you reset to zero every January.”Few universal banks split out their transaction banking performance. But Deutsche Bank, for example, recorded transaction banking pre-tax profits of €1.1bn in 2008, up 17 per cent and equivalent to an ROE of 108 per cent. Though the number slipped back – to €776m – in 2009, that relatively stable performance contrasts with the investment banking result, which was €7.4bn in the red in 2008, thanks to the toxic asset fall-out from the financial crisis, and then €4.3bn in the black again last year.Deutsche has been one of several banks that have strategically prioritised the business, recently buying the old ABN Amro transaction banking unit.The big US names – State Street and BNY Mellon – have also been acquisitive in the wake of the financial crisis. BNY Mellon picked up asset servicing businesses from Sal Oppenheim in Germany and PNC in the US. State Street, meanwhile, bought the servicing business of Italy’s Intesa.“There are two reasons for the consolidation trend,” says Mr Keaney at BNY Mellon. “This business requires enormous investment in technology and it’s becoming more global.”The investment budgets are vast – BNY Mellon spends $600m-$700m a year from $12bn of revenues – as banks respond to client pressure for faster, cheaper services, and in turn make it ever harder for smaller operators to compete.For State Street, the Intesa deal was the perfect illustration of the other consolidation driver – the need for a global presence. Strong as Intesa’s position was in Italy, it was becoming difficult to compete given clients’ international requirements.But there are new competitors, too. Citigroup’s deal to sell its technology arm to India’s Wipro is seen as part of a trend that could see technology and utility groups become far bigger in securities processing.More challenging still is the potential threat posed by new regulatory rules. The most sweeping rule book is the Basel III framework – which toughens capital, liquidity and leverage standards. Trade finance, in particular, is set to be hit, prompting strong lobbying from some big trade finance banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered.The European Union’s Alternative Investment Fund Management directive will add to the burden, particularly in global custody.For assets capable of being held in custody, the AIFM directive sets a tough legal standard – custodians will have to replace any missing assets, unless they can prove the losses are due to something beyond their reasonable control.“The AIFM directive has the potential to change the dynamics between global custodians, prime brokers and depositaries in Europe with the emphasis on fiduciary risks and responsibilities,” says Andrew Long, head of transaction banking at HSBC.If custodians can be held responsible for vast losses incurred on activities they intermediatedbanks and their regulators will need to establish higher capital standards for the business.One big UK investor says: “Suddenly the banks are realising that the custody business is low-margin and high-risk, really high-risk.”The dull world of transaction banking is now being shaken up. Quite how much will determine the degree to which it can continue to be a ballast of reliable profitability in troubled times.
448;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-12-12T18:50:09Z;Banks brace for Madoff custodian fall-out;;Banks with large custody operations are braced for the business to become more capital intensive and less profitable, fearful that lawsuits filed by the trustee of the collapsed Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme will harden regulators’ resolve to raise capital standards.Custody has traditionally been a high-volume, low-margin business that required little capital to support it. But the multibillion-dollar lawsuits against HSBC and UBS over their roles as custodians for Madoff feeder funds have highlighted the potential risks of the business.One big investment bank boss said: “Custody is a mispriced service. Banks should charge more for it and regulators should charge more capital against it.”Although HSBC and UBS have resolved to fight the Madoff cases, the legal process risks costing the banks tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of pounds. That compares with the estimated £200,000- £300,000 ($316,000-$474,000) that HSBC business would have generated, bankers said. HSBC was custodian to about one-third of all the assets invested with Mr Madoff, the trustee said.Custodians – particularly in Europe – are facing further burdens from new regulation.Most of the changes are a direct response to the financial crisis, particularly the Madoff scandal and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Regulators discovered that Lehman and other big banks had failed properly to segregate and ring-fence client assets, so investors could not easily access their holdings in the event of a default.In the European Union, the alternative investment fund managers directive, passed this autumn, for the first time sets a universal standard and set of requirements for custodian banks, which hedge funds and other investment vehicles use to safeguard their assets. In many circumstances, custodians could be liable to replace lost assets.“It’s going to put a lot more responsibility on them,” said Gregg Beechey, senior associate at SJ Berwin. “Some banks may decide this is now too risky.”The US has already tightened some custody rules for investment managers and may well extend its reforms to broker dealers. There are a handful of big operators in global custody. Besides HSBC, the market is dominated by US groups, such as State Street, BNY Mellon and Citigroup.“There is going to be a lot more regulatory scrutiny both of us and of the companies we work for. That’s an enormous undertaking,” said Tim Keaney, chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.

450;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-11-22T19:29:13Z;Eurozone troubles;More bail-outs to come, or is this the line in the sand?;The script was simple. After the Irish government gave in and asked for help at the weekend, a relief rally would push up the euro for a while, along with risk assets around the world. That would have fit the pattern of previous great contagion crises, from US credit in 2007-08, through Asia in 1997, to the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992-93. But European equities sold off, the euro weakened against the dollar and Irish spreads widened.The expected rescue package is not the problem. It should be big enough to get the Irish banks through their funding and capital difficulties. There is no reason to change the previous assumption: Ireland may repay this extra debt but only with great economic pain.Rather, markets have political worries. Inside Ireland, there is turmoil, suggesting no one has a mandate to accept the aid. In the eurozone, the crisis came to a head in spite of Ireland having no sovereign funding needs for months because of a political faultline: the mere suggestion from Germany and France that a crisis resolution mechanism should involve hits for banks’ investors and not just taxpayers.Germany’s political class must now decide how much it will pay to keep the euro. As BNY Mellon points out, in 1993 the Bundesbank ended the old European Union exchange rate mechanism by opting to keep its own inflation-fighting credentials rather than cutting interest rates to make it easier for the French franc to stay in. The dynamics of the current episode are similar, with strong opposition to spending German taxpayers’ money on peripheral countries.Investors understand this. Hence they skipped a relief rally and moved straight to the next question in a contagion: “Who’s next?” The answer is Portugal, for which the market now thinks a similar rescue package is a given. Spain is already being fitted up to follow.At least the script for how contagions end is consistent.

451;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-11-17T16:46:53Z;Bankers eye options to boost liquidity;Some bankers argue that companies should use DRs to boost interest;Tentatively improving investor sentiment has delivered a mild rally on most Gulf stock markets recently, but trading volumes remain woefully low.The average daily turnover in the Gulf markets so far this year has been $980m, almost half that in the same period last year, and almost a third of the $2.55bn daily average in 2008, according to Zawya, a local data provider.The primary victims have been brokerages, but many company executives also argue that the trading slump has hindered effective “price discovery” and their shares trade below their true worth.DP World, Dubai’s ports operator, has signalled plans to list shares on the London Stock Exchange to boost its shares.Some bankers argue that Gulf companies should also consider listing depositary receipts, or DRs, on international exchanges to counter low trading volumes and boost foreign institutional interest.Depositary receipts are financial instruments that represent the economic value of a company’s underlying shares, or occasionally bonds, and are often used by local companies to list and trade on international exchanges, such as the LSE or the New York Stock Exchange.“The [local] liquidity is really horrendous, and DRs could have to come back due to the low local listing liquidity,” says the head of capital markets at a leading investment bank.Several Middle East companies already run DR programmes, such as Orascom Telecom, Orascom Construction and Commercial International Bank in Egypt, Solidere in Lebanon and Turkcell.Last year three more companies started DR programmes: Lebanon’s Byblos Bank, Egypt’s GB Auto and Hikma Pharmaceutical in Jordan. Overall, the region saw $9.2bn of DRs trade last year, according to research by Bank of New York Mellon.Gulf companies have proven more reluctant to list DRs, and Investcorp in Bahrain and Kingdom Holding in Saudi Arabia recently delisted DRs from the LSE and Nasdaq Dubai.However, Peter Gotke, vice-president of depositary receipts at BNYM, points out that Global Investment House in Kuwait and BankMuscat in Oman run relatively successful programmes, and says that several companies in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are preparing potential DR sales next year.“The Gulf was about to take off before the crisis, and it seems to be coming back now,” he says. “DRs can be an important tool in counteracting low liquidity in local markets.”Aluminium Bahrain, or Alba, recently joined the small band of Gulf companies with DR programmes when it sold 10 per cent of itself to investors – in the form of 69m ordinary shares on the Bahrain stock exchange and 14.6m GDRs, each representing five ordinary shares.More Gulf companies should consider following Alba, argues Hani Kablawi, chairman of BNYM’s Middle East operations. “The Gulf markets need more institutional and international investors, and issuing DRs can be a way of attracting them.”
452;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Irish bail-out talks weigh on euro;;The euro lost ground on Tuesday as investors monitored a meeting of eurozone finance ministers for signs that they would hammer out an agreement to provide support for Ireland.Analysts said hopes of some sort of rescue package for Dublin would ease pressure in the eurozone government debt market and help prevent contagion from Ireland’s woes towards other countries on the periphery of the eurozone, such as Portugal.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon warned that the problems for the euro, which has fallen 3 per cent against the dollar since the start of the month as eurozone sovereign concerns have re-emerged, were far from over, even if a support programme for Portugal were also agreed.“With Greece already in receipt of aid and, presumably, Ireland and Portugal likely to be the beneficiaries of support packages, then this suggests that at some point investors will start to focus their attention on Spain instead,” he said.“The European authorities will have bought themselves some time but they should not assume that the crisis is over just yet.”In late New York trade, the euro eased 0.7 per cent to a seven-week low of $1.3488 against the dollar and was 0.5 per weaker at Y112.36 against the yen.The euro rose 0.4 per cent to £0.84955 against the pound, however, after Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, said the central bank could engage in further quantitative easing “if that turned out to be necessary”. Sterling also fell 1.1 per cent to $1.5876 against the dollar.Meanwhile, the dollar consolidated gains after a sharp move higher on Monday sparked by a surge in US Treasury yields.The driving force behind the rise in Treasury yields, and the dollar, was a trimming of positions once the Federal Reserve announced an extension to its QE programme following heavy buying in anticipation of the decision. Stronger US economic data has also boosted yields.Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas said the rise in yields was prompting investors to buy the dollar as they unwound carry trades, in which the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets is funded by selling low-yielding currencies.The dollar was up 0.3 per cent at Y83.30 against the yen and 1.2 per cent stronger at SFr0.9963 against the Swiss franc.The dollar gained against commodity-linked currencies as raw material prices suffered from continuing fears that China was set to tighten monetary policy to rein in inflationary pressures. The dollar rose 0.9 per cent to $0.9761 against the Australian dollar. It gained 1.2 per cent against the Canadian dollar at $C1.0222 and was up 0.9 per cent against the South African rand to R7.0566.
453;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-11-14T20:16:19Z;Economic Outlook: Debt concerns to dominate;Debt concerns to dominate;The turmoil in the European bond markets will mean the spotlight is turned on the continent’s policymaking meetings and data releases this week, as markets search for signals on whether sovereign debt problems could escalate dramatically.“The current sea of red across market screens reflects the current fears for the eurozone’s periphery,” said Neil Mellor of Bank of New York Mellon. “We could well be in for quite a ride in the hours that lie ahead.”European finance ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels on Wednesday, with sovereign debt concerns sure to dominate.“The market will look for signals on the German proposal for a debt restructuring mechanism,” said Danske Bank analysts.Eurozone data releases will see revised Greek debt and gross domestic product figures released on Monday along with eurozone trade figures, while the German Zew survey of investor sentiment will be a significant indicator on Tuesday.“This week sees the release of the eurozone trade balance for September and November’s Zew survey,” said Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics. “While the former should reveal that annual export growth remains strong for now, the latter could show signs of contagion from the periphery’s troubles.“What’s more, a likely upward revision to the Greek budget deficit on Monday will do nothing to ease markets’ fears.”In the US, the main focus will be on retail sales figures on Monday, with data releases there also including industrial production on Tuesday, inflation and housing starts on Wednesday, while the Philadelphia Fed regional manufacturing survey is set for Thursday.The consensus forecast is for a rise in US retail sales for October of 0.7 per cent, boosted particularly by strong car sales. But sales excluding petrol, food and cars may have increased by a more modest 0.3 per cent, said Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. “We would caution against concluding that a strong rise in retail sales in October is a sign that households are spending freely again,” he said.Meanwhile, a bumper week for UK releases will provide crucial details of economic activity in the fourth quarter, with inflation, jobs, retail sales and government finances all emerging between Tuesday and Thursday.“Domestic markets are now of the view that further quantitative easing is unlikely in the UK, which has supported sterling and pushed gilt yields up,” said Philip Shaw of Investec. “While we concur, there is a significant amount of data this week to digest that could alter market opinion.”The release of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee minutes on Wednesday will be studied for differences between QE hawks and doves.Asia data will be highlighted by Japan’s third-quarter growth figures on Monday, with analysts expecting quarter-on-quarter growth to advance slightly to 0.6 per cent.
454;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-31T10:42:23Z;Abdallah Nauphal: boutique boss keen to tailor products;;For a man who dislikes being part of big groups, Abdallah Nauphal, chief executive of Insight Investment, is remarkably content.Insight was sold by Lloyds Banking Group to Bank of New York Mellon last year for £235m ($373m), seemingly swapping one big parent for another. At BNY Mellon, Insight is one of 18 boutiques that make up a financial group with $1,000bn of assets under management.But Mr Nauphal is comfortable with that. He says: “BNY Mellon is experienced in managing a multi-boutique structure, and asset management is a core part of what they do and a big part of their total revenues.”With Lloyds, he says, “asset management was a decimal point in the total revenue of the business”.Flows held up well during the acquisition period, with Insight showing strong results at the end of 2009. “We didn’t lose a key investor or member of our team and performance throughout remained robust,” says Mr Nauphal.He describes 2009 as a “pivotal year”. Apart from new ownership, Insight enjoyed its largest year-on-year growth in assets under management, with a rise to £88bn from £73bn at the end of 2008. This year promises even faster growth, judging by the £108.5bn of assets accrued by the end of September.Revenue growth comes largely from liability driven investment solutions for pension funds, where Insight was an early entrant, and also from fixed income and absolute return funds.Mr Nauphal maintains every few years investors go through an “unhappy or disgruntlement cycle with the industry” about the products they are sold. Such an observation fuelled his belief that tailored solutions, such as LDI, better meet the needs of pension funds to match assets with liabilities.With the backing of a global parent group, Mr Nauphal hopes to take Insight into the international arena and plans to roll out LDI funds in the US.“There is an increasing awareness of the role that liabilities play in the US institutional space. People are starting to take liabilities much more seriously in deciding their investment strategies,” he says.Plans are also afoot to further expand in Europe, mainly in developed economies where “people and schemes are beginning to rethink strategies” and are shifting towards a solution focus. “This opens up a whole new market for us,” says Mr Nauphal. Unlike many asset managers rushing to get a foothold in Asia, Mr Nauphal says this will “probably be down the road”.However, being part of a US group also brings the additional burden of transatlantic regulations, requiring reporting work on compliance with US rules such as Sarbanes-Oxley. But Mr Nauphal is unfazed, even though the industry is facing a plethora of European legislation.He says Insight is a step ahead on issues such as EU requirements on remuneration. “We have always been a big believer in deferring compensation and created a deferment mechanism some years ago with substantial sums being deferred, so not too far off what the regulator is asking us for,” he says.Now he is waiting to see how the Financial Services Authority will interpret Brussels’ rules in the UK.As a user of over-the-counter derivatives, he is also watching developments concerning the enforcement of centralised clearing, “which will have an important impact on us and our clients”. Insight has played an active part in the consultation process with UK and European regulators and hopes to have further discussion before the final report is published. He maintains the regulator is “thinking banks” and is not focused on “other substantial players in the market like pensions funds”, so it is necessary to make sure “their interest is represented”, he says.On the new fund front, Insight plans to launch a global farmland fund, attracted to the “positive supply-demand factor and increased demand for the produce of farmlands from the newly industrialising world”, says Mr Nauphal.He expects strong demand from pension funds and endowments and “anyone looking for longer-term appreciation and income, not needing immediate liquidity”.Insight’s rapid growth in assets means it is hiring again in the financial solutions group, on the legal side and on the client servicing side. “In the past 18 months our asset base has grown by about £25bn to £30bn and we are keen our resources keep pace with growth,” he adds.After the auction of Insight, analysts expected to see a spate of sell-offs in the industry but that has not yet happened. “There is a lot of backroom discussion but little has come to fruition,” according to Mr Nauphal.Among the sticking points to sell-offs are complex group structures of parent companies of asset managers. “Often the structures are more complicated than people think. It’s not easy to extricate asset management operations from banks and insurance companies,” he says.Another difficulty is integrating cultures in an industry that is people focused. Mr Nauphal says that he believes “the most important assets we have are people and skills and anything that undermines the culture has to be done carefully”.Debates on whether two corporate cultures will mesh will continue to be a thorny issue.But he does not believe companies have stopped trying to merge. “I think it just has not led to the kind of deals expected by now.”
455;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-31T09:09:15Z;Emerging market debt leads all bond fund classes;;They say if it sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true, but many in the asset management business would like to make an exception for emerging market bonds (fixed income investing report).With an uncertain global economic outlook, global bond funds generally have had a record year, according to data from EPFR Global, which provides fund flows and asset allocation data. But EPFR data show emerging market bond funds in particular have been having a fantastic year. Net inflows to emerging markets bond funds, in the nine months to the end of September, were more than $39bn – already a massive 430 per cent of their best full-year totals.“Emerging markets don’t get credit crunch [disease],” says Jerome Booth, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management. “The big story in emerging markets is that pension funds are selling the really risky stuff like Treasuries and investing in emerging markets,” he argues.Ashmore is dedicated to emerging markets and the outspoken Mr Booth is famously bullish about prospects for emerging markets generally, as well as emerging market debt.What has changed dramatically in the past two years, people in the industry say, is that increasing numbers of asset managers are agreeing with him.“What happened in the credit crunch is that people realised emerging markets are actually in pretty good shape,” says Brett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management.Already, though, portions of the EM debt market have matured and for the higher returns that used to be associated with all emerging market bonds, investors are moving from sovereign dollar- denominated bonds to local currency bonds and corporate debt.Ashmore, for example, had $5.3bn (at the end of Q3) in emerging market corporate debt against $700m at the end of 2009.Pension funds focused on the risk reward relationship need to be conscious what risks they are buying.Standish, part of the BNY Mellon Asset Management group, believes emerging market dollar- denominated and local currency- denominated bonds are two distinct asset classes.“Structurally, US-dollar denominated EM debt is similar to other credit asset classes, such as corporate bonds in the US,” says Alexander Kozhemiakin, director of emerging market strategies and senior portfolio manager at Standish.“At current levels of 270-280 basis points, spreads are quite reasonable and provide more than adequate compensation for potential default losses, but they are not astonishingly attractive,” Mr Kozhemiakin adds.Instead, for clients on the trail of double-digit returns, Standish, which manages a total of $8bn in emerging market debt, is emphasising its local currency fund.“EM local currency-denominated bonds can plausibly generate double-digit returns. Moreover, their main sources of risk – currencies and local rates – are distinct from the risks that most investors already have in their portfolios,” Mr Kozhemiakin says.The most aggressive of Standish’s investors have an allocation close to 10 per cent, with most institutional clients preferring a more cautious 2 to 3 per cent.The totals are expected to rise rapidly as US institutions, which have lagged behind Europe, begin to jump on the EM debt bandwagon.Much more money, therefore, is expected to pour into emerging market debt. But so much money has poured into emerging markets already that some countries have taken action – Brazil recently raised a tax on foreign purchases of domestic debt to 6 per cent, while Thailand reinstated a 15 per cent withholding tax on interest payments and capital gains on bonds held by foreign investors.While fund managers say these measures are likely to have little impact, others are beginning to warn of the risk of a bubble.The World Bank, in its half-yearly review of regional trends in its East Asia and Pacific Economic Update published on October 19, warned that inflows of capital were a growing risk to East Asian economic stability.“One important implication of the surging capital inflows is their impact on the future stability of the banking system. The rise in asset prices and potential bursts of related bubbles, especially when the share of speculative inflows has been high, could result in sudden stops and capital reversals,” the report says.Investors thinking they can avoid the risk of overheating by staying away from East Asia might do well to remember another first for October – Mexico issued Latin America’s first century bond.“Any time an investor buys a 100-year bond they are exposing themselves to massive interest rate risk and price volatility,” says Peter Marber, who heads the emerging market bonds business at HSBC Global Asset Management. But although he agrees that Mexico’s offering is a risky bet for an investor wanting to invest in a sovereign bond, it has not dimmed his fervour for emerging markets generally.“People have been raising the question about a bubble, but there really isn’t a huge amount of evidence of overvaluation in the broad market. Certain new bond deals may look rich, but the overall markets will offer fundamental value, particularly in credit,” he adds.Thomas Delabre, emerging markets debt fund manager at Amundi Asset Management, also thinks fears of a bubble show a misunderstanding: “I don’t think there is a bubble because the asset class is still expanding. We’ve had huge asset flows this year, but the base of investment is much bigger than it was before. We’re not in a situation where everyone is invested.”Mr Delabre adds: “You do have inflationary risk, although you can play the curve, but inflation is a risk because growth is strong and in many countries the food component is greater than in developed nations.”Despite the win-win scenario painted by asset managers, pension funds are still largely cautious in their allocations. “Investors have long memories.” Mr Marber says, pointing out that in the past 15 years there have been shocks to investors, such as the Asian financial crisis and defaults in Russia and Argentina.Differentiating between different kinds of emerging market bond should, therefore, be an absolute requirement. A large allocation to local currency debt is strongly recommended but index tracking investors, for example, could be steered into investing in the most indebted countries simply because they are issuing most debt, as a column in the Financial Times recently pointed out. For those seeking the holy grail of higher returns, emerging market corporate debt is the new big story. “The asset class that’s offering the highest return right now is clearly the high yield corporate sector … you may find a local company offering 15 per cent, but the issue is you have to do the work, in terms of research,” says Mr Delabre.“A diversified, actively managed mix of hard currency and local currency, government and corporate may prove to be an optimal recipe of risk and reward,” says Mr Marber.

Given where dollar/yen is now trading, joint intervention to avert new all-time lows appears to offer it the perfect opportunity to do so.“Failure by the US to send such a message risks emboldening dollar bears and would place its commitment under intense scrutiny in Seoul when G20 leaders meet again on November 11-12.”
457;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-21T18:51:39Z;Dollar unmoved by strong talk;With QE pending, no amount of talk is likely to make much difference to the dollar;"The good news about China’s slowing growth is that there is less chance of a spectacular overheating.The bad news is that it will diminish the likelihood, such as it was, of any dramatic renminbi revaluation because slowing export growth will cool any appetite for a stronger currency.This point takes on extra importance in the context of the upcoming weekend G20 meeting in Seoul and particularly following the repeated “ strong dollar” diplomatic talk by Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary.Mr Geithner was a junior architect of the original use of the phrase in the mid-1990s when it was an affirmation of the government’s intention to ensure that the dollar’s value was a factor in supporting investment into the US. From 2001, the mantra was devalued by repetition and by the G7 emphasis on market freedom to set prices – in the process papering over Japan’s repeated interventions. As Simon Derrick, head of currency strategy at Bank of New York Mellon, put it, the translation of that was: “We might like a strong currency but we don’t mind if you don’t.”The larger G20 group, which contains several currency manipulators, cannot put out similar statements. This gives Mr Geithner’s recent comments genuine significance.Can they boost the dollar? Success in the foreign exchange markets is largely a matter of timing and Mr Geithner could have got his right; dollar shorts have been scaling back their bets, implying that the market may not have the appetite to push the currency further.But the path to any dollar gains contains a big speed bump – quantitative easing. The actual size of any further Federal Reserve action is not yet fully clear. But until investors know that, then no amount of strong currency talk is likely to make much difference to the dollar."

The foundation works with 54 businesses and employs 100 people, up from just three when it began, helping more than 400 people a year.Yet the government grants it relies on are likely to shrink.Mr Collins, who gained a CBE for his work as chief executive, says: “There are going to be cuts like I have never experienced before – but there are also going to be opportunities. There still need to be services for the disadvantaged. Those people are not going away. “Local authorities know they need to find new ways of providing those, and we will work with them.”He also warns that the big funders such as the National Lottery will be swamped by grant applications.Mr Collins says he may have to axe staff as the foundation has few overheads to cut. He could also dip into reserves to continue to fund what he considers to be vital services.“We have continued to fund a primary school reading programme since the funding ran out,” he says.The Salford Foundation works with Bank of New York Mellon, which opened a big office in Manchester in 2005, training staff to volunteer. However, Mr Collins says the private sector is unlikely to fill the funding gap left by government.“You get employee volunteering from business but we have not looked to them to deliver services or pay for that, and nor would we.”Verdict“I welcome the support for things like citizenship and big society projects.“The negative is that when you look at the local authority cuts [7.1 per cent], it is inevitable that there are going to be some unintended consequences.“One of those is likely to be the impact on the ‘third sector’ in local areas, the funding they receive and the services they deliver.”
459;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
460;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-19T23:57:55Z;Investors join forces in BofA bond fight;;Some of the world’s largest institutional investors have joined forces with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to recover losses on more than $47bn in mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial, the consumer lender acquired by Bank of America.The eight boldholders, which include BlackRock, Pimco and MetLife, own more than 25 per cent of the voting rights on the securities. The New York Fed inherited its stake in the bonds during the financial crisis.The bondholders argue that BofA violated elements of its servicing agreements. They aim to put back loans that fell short of the underwriting standards stated in the 115 deals.News that such powerful investors would take on BofA re-ignited fears the bank had underestimated the cost of buying back troubled loans. BofA shares fell 4.4 per cent.“We’re not responsible for the poor performance of loans as a result of a bad economy,” a BofA spokesman said. “We don’t believe we’ve breached our obligations as servicer. We will examine every avenue to vigorously defend ourselves.”Kathy Patrick, an attorney representing the investors, wrote to BofA and the trustee of the securities, Bank of New York Mellon, on Monday to express objections. She said her clients first raised their concerns to BoNY in June.When BoNY refused to investigate, the bondholders chose to enforce the put-back policies, she said. “They have 60 days to fix this,” she said. “If they don’t, we can declare an event of default under the servicing agreement.” BofA executives said it had the means to fight individual claims and had set aside $4.4bn in put-back reserves. “If you think about people who come back and say, ‘I bought a Vega, a Chevy Vega, but I want it to be a Mercedes with a 12-cylinder,’ we’re not putting up with that,” said Brian Moynihan, BofA’s chief executive.A BoNY executive said the bank had received the letter, which it said “does not ask Bank of New York Mellon to take any action.” The New York Fed, BlackRock and MetLife declined to comment. A call to Pimco was not returned.
461;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-17T07:51:12Z;Custodians confident AIFM will bring clarity;;Depositories are breathing a sigh of relief over the alternative investment fund managers (AIFM) directive.As negotiations draw to a close, the responsibilities of the future hedge fund asset safe-keepers have been watered down compared with early draft proposals.At the time of going to press, custodians are quite upbeat about the latest version of the directive, which aims to create a secure regime for professional investors in hedge funds.David Curtin, general counsel for Northern Trust in Europe, says: “There is an improvement on what we’ve seen in the past where we would have had responsibility on the loss of financial instruments. Now we won’t be liable if loss rises beyond reasonable control.”Initial proposals by the European Commission in the wake of the financial crisis stated that depositories would be liable for the loss of AIFM assets “no matter what”. After the publication of first drafts, depositories say they went on to lead a rather quiet but apparently productive lobbying exercise in the corridors of Brussels.According to depositories, unlimited liability would have led to “unintended consequences”, including the possibility of increased costs for investors and, most worryingly for regulators, the potential growth of systemic risks in the wake of sector consolidation.Paul Bodart, executive vice-president at BNY Mellon, says: “There have been a lot of discussions with Brussels. The text is better. Although there is still an obligation of results [where only the outcome counts], we are liable only for things that are under our control. I don’t think we will be able to change that for an obligation of means [where intention matters most]: it’s non-negotiable.”Also, although finer details of the AIFM directive could still change, custodians are confident the 11-page depository section will bring much-needed clarity to the industry’s role and functions.The legislation, for example, will provide a European definition on safe-keeping, whose loose interpretation recently led to very different legal outcomes in cases of asset loss.In France, a court ruled that RBC Dexia was liable to return all assets to three hedge funds that had lost assets held by Lehman Brothers, while investors in Luxembourg-based Ucits funds kept by US fraudster Bernard Madoff are still to receive any compensation.Mr Bodart says: “[AIFM] is a big progress. Previous depository regimes were loose and interpretations were very different. The definition of what a depository must do [under the AIFM regime] is a lot more accurate.”Crucially, the legislation says a sub-custodian will be able to take liability under contract, instead of the custodian.This, however, will come at the cost of tough due diligence conditions, and only if the custodian “can demonstrate there is an objective reason for the delegation”, according to a recent AIFM proposal from the Belgian presidency.Mr Curtin says: “It goes against how we’re structured, and also the thinking is unclear. A lot of things need to be clarified.”Even though depositories will avoid untenable levels of liability under the latest proposals, AIFM is likely to prove lengthy and costly when problems arise. The reverse of the “burden of proof”, for example, will mean depositories must prove they have no responsibility in case of lost assets. Before, investors had to prove there had been fault on the custodian side.Despite these issues, the AIFM directive is still considered as a good deal.More worrying perhaps is the fact the Commission plans to “reconcile” the hedge fund directive with the Ucits legislation, importing features such as on depositories.Ugo Bassi, head of unit for asset management at the Commission’s DG Internal Market and Services, recently warned that “we’ll certainly end up with a [depository] regime stricter in Ucits than in AIFM”. This position is shared by the French regulator, AMF, which criticised the Ucits regime for failing to protect retail investors from Bernard Madoff.Patrice Bergé-Vincent, head of asset management policy at the AMF, recently said: “Institutional investors don’t need protection from the regulator but [by doing]. . . their own due diligence. [However], Ucits are marketed to retail investors who are not capable of understanding custody arrangements. They need rules to protect them.”The Commission is waiting for an agreement over the AIFM directive before starting to draft “clarifications” on Ucits rules. Although it is at an early stage, a few ideas have already emerged.For example, regulators have explained that the future retail regime will establish the level of liability for each participant.Whereas contractual discharges will be possible between managers and custodians under AIFM, the overriding rule under Ucits will be that there should be an obligation for a depository to restitute assets to an investor “with very few exemptions”. Depositories could expect to have more “constructive explanations” to give to regulators.
462;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ETP growth spurs boost in servicing role;;The huge growth in the number and variety of exchange-traded products (ETPs) over the past decade has also led to a big increase in demand for the expertise of asset servicing managers, such as BNY Mellon, State Street and Brown Brothers Harriman.The number of ETPs has increased to more than 3,000 from just 35 in 1999, according to BlackRock, as new providers enter the market and growing numbers of traditional fund managers expand their product ranges to include ETPs.This proliferation has encouraged asset servicing providers to develop consultation services for fund managers unfamiliar with the ETP market.Gavin Nangle, head of business development at State Street in Dublin, says ETP clients are increasingly looking for value-added services. He likens himself to a matchmaker who can intermediate between ETP sponsors and market makers, easing the burden of building relationships due to State Street’s extensive worldwide network. Along with providing advice to potential ETP sponsors on market practices, State Street has also seen a growing demand for tax services related to ETPs.Mr Nangle says US managers, who are used to dealing with a single currency and single tax model, face a daunting shift when trying to move into Europe, where there are multiple regulators and varying tax arrangements.A key driver of the growth in the European market has been the rapid proliferation of synthetic or swap-based ETPs that use derivatives to track an index rather than investing directly in the constituents of a benchmark.The number of swap-based ETPs available in Europe has risen from just 27 in 2005 to more than 600. This has required asset servicing managers to expand their involvement in swap pricing.State Street already has extensive familiarity with alternative managers and the derivative instruments they use, so that expertise was readily transferred into the ETP market, says Mr Nangle.“State Street runs complex pricing models for OTC products and was able to use that expertise to provide swap pricing in synthetic ETPs.”Shawn McNinch, global head of ETF services for Brown Brothers Harriman, says BBH is seeing “lots of discussions” with potential new entrants that are considering launching passive ETPs and also asking whether active ETPs could fit into their current product offering.BBH has built a consulting services team that helps potential ETF sponsors develop their ideas from the conceptual phase to market, advising on legal requirements, regulations and tax issues as well as navigating the actual launch process.It too offers sponsors help with building relationships with exchanges, and market makers.Mr McNinch says BBH has made substantial investments into its core accounting platform to process swap contracts efficiently, which positions it well to service synthetic ETPs.The increasing use of synthetic ETPs has led BBH to make substantial investments into its core accounting platform to process swap contracts efficiently and to provide reconciliation services with swap counterparties.“It is necessary to have a strong infrastructure to support synthetic ETP structures, particularly if multiple swap counterparties are being used in order to reduce counterparty risk,” says Mr McNinch.As ETPs are low-cost products, reducing the costs associated with asset servicing remains a key focus for industry participants that have invested heavily in technology to drive out inefficiencies.But minimising costs in Europe remains challenging due to variations in clearing and settlement systems and differing regulatory environments that can add to expenses.Asset service providers also say that because ETPs are traded in both a primary and secondary market, additional levels of information and transparency are required compared with a traditional mutual fund.
463;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-17T07:51:12Z;Size matters, as do satisfied clients;;The credit crunch has changed much in the asset servicing market but the age-old debate over whether big is best remains.The market’s giants continue to extol the virtues of scale, while the minnows point to their agility and attention to detail.Size, it seems, does still matter but what has really come to the fore is customer service. A firm’s ability to make its clients feel special will, according to experts, separate the winners from the losers.“Clients want to feel valued and are not now prepared to accept second-rate service,” says Richard Hogsflesh, managing director of R&M Consultants, which ranks custody houses in terms of client satisfaction. “Customers want to have a closer relationship with their providers and want to be sure those providers are truly committed to the market. Firms must now be a genuine source of expertise.”According to Patrick Colle, chief executive of BNP Paribas Securities Services, this was at the heart of why the group overhauled its management structure last month.It introduced four new business lines, six client segment heads, and eight regional chiefs to increase its “agility” and respond to its clients’ “global needs”.“Our clients were a key driver in the reorganisation. We knew we needed to get closer to our customers because in turbulent times they need more advice, more support and tailor-made solutions,” says Mr Colle.The overhaul, however, was announced just days before BNP fell from second to last place (sixth) in an annual R&M ranking of administrators. The results were based on the client-satisfaction responses of 48 UK asset managers.Mr Colle, however, is quick to point out that company progression – rather than poor performance – was behind its restructuring. “The change is absolutely not an admission that the previous structure wasn’t working,” he says. “It is about moving the business to the next level. We are the number one player in Europe and want to compete with the top four internationally. The restructuring is about us taking the next step in achieving that.”Mr Colle is not alone in putting an emphasis on a firm’s global capabilities. He and many others believe having a global offering will also clearly separate the market’s best and worst providers.“Those providers that only concentrate on their domestic markets and only service local clients will get hurt,” says Michael Wilson, global head of corporate affairs at RBC Dexia Investors. “Our clients are becoming more global and so must we.”Mr Colle adds: “You need to be pan-European as an absolute minimum these days to survive. If you are not, it is likely you might get bought.”That appears a fair assessment, and the one firm doing most of the buying right now is BNY Mellon Asset Servicing. In February the custody giant announced it was to buy Delaware-based PNC Global Investment Servicing for $2.31bn, while in August it completed the acquisition of BHF Asset Servicing from BHF-Bank and Sal Oppenheim for $343m.Those deals brought an additional $3,000bn of assets under custody to the firm on top of the $21,800bn in assets it already held, and there may be yet more to come.BNY Mellon’s financial institutions group head Nadine Chakar says: “I expect to see more consolidation, especially in Europe.“Forthcoming regulation will impact smaller providers and their longevity in the market will depend on how they adapt to those regulatory changes. If they don’t keep up, they will get acquired.”She adds: “If we see the right opportunities we will take them, but right now our priority is the integration of PNC and BHF.”BNY Mellon climbed one place to joint third in the same R&M annual ranking of administrators that found BNP to be wanting. HSBC and Northern Trust were first and second in that list respectively.One of the 48 asset manager respondents to the survey said of BNY: “Our overall relationship with BNY Mellon has improved over the last 12 months. The number of errors across the business has reduced and NAV [net asset value] errors in particular have reduced. A focus on the client relationship and the establishment of an embedded risk team has improved the overall offering.”Mr Hogsflesh says these types of comments suggest there will always be room for smaller players.“Clients want to feel valued whether they are big or small but unfortunately those smaller customers tend to get lost at the big firms. There will always be a place for certain niche providers.”Ms Chakar agrees niche firms will always have their place but says being big does not equate to bad service:“This market is not just about being big, it’s about being good. We are constantly investing in our business because it’s important to BNY Mellon. Asset servicing makes up 35 per cent of revenues at BNY Mellon and that, I think, is really telling.”
464;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-17T07:51:12Z;Institutions focus on counterparty risk;;"Counterparty risk has been thrust into the spotlight since the fall of Lehman Brothers, causing the buy-side to ramp up its risk controls, including increasing the frequency of margin calls, changes in types of collateral, and using more counterparties.Collateral management was mainly a matter for investment banks in the past, but the increasing use of derivatives for hedging or gain by asset managers and investors has made it an issue for the buy-side as well as the sell-side.Philippe Rozental, head of asset servicing at Société Générale Securities Services, says in responding to margin calls by a counterparty, requiring the delivery of extra cash or bonds, institutions used to rely on the counterparty’s evaluation of changing positions.“Since the crisis, financial institutions want independent valuations of their positions,” he says. “So the choice is either to invest in big IT platforms and hire people or to rely on specialist providers.”It is now much more common, according to Mr Rozental, for a specialist provider to monitor the collateral and provide full support to investors on the collateral process. This includes contract negotiations, managing the collateral positions, calculating on a day-to-day basis what are the collateral requirements, dealing with the different counterparts and challenging the margin calls.Another reason institutions are looking to outsource, according to Staffan Ahlner, managing director of global collateral management at BNY Mellon, is because an increase in the frequency of margin calls means managing those calls becomes resource intensive.“Prior to the crisis institutions were setting up derivative transactions and only calling the margin once a month. Now we are down to daily calls for collateral,” says Mr Ahlner.Service providers have also noted that the type of collateral now being used is of a higher quality and agreements are regularly being put in place to set out the criteria of how and when collateral is managed.Simon Lillystone, director of collateral and margin management at Omgeo, which provides tools for parties to agree margin calls primarily on the back of derivatives trading, says the most common type of collateral used in the past was cash.“Now the buy-side has come on board we are going to see more activity using non-cash collateral,” says Mr Lillystone. This means bonds and securities at the moment, but in the future could extend to real estate and letters of credit, for example, which would require more sophisticated systems to value collateral and monitor it.Paul Wilson, global head of client management and sales for financing and markets products at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, points to an increased use of credit support annexes (CSAs) when managing the collateral between counterparties, as well as more use of customised parameters around the details included in the CSA.“For example, in a pre-market crisis environment virtually every CSA we supported on behalf of our clients would specify a minimum amount that would move between the two counterparties.“Virtually all of them today have no minimum amount: whatever the amount of money it is, it gets moved.”Those agreements are also much more specific on the type of collateral that can get moved between counterparties, adds Mr Wilson. “Before the crisis, it might have said any government security and now it might say specifically US Treasuries with maturities of less than five years, or bonds issued by the UK.”Mr Ahlner adds that collateral agreements were in the past set up, but never really used.“Lehman has increased the buy-side’s awareness of counterparty and custody risk. It is not enough for investors to sign a CSA; the collateralisation process has to be actively monitored and managed, which then puts a demand on firms.”JPMorgan’s Mr Wilson believes institutions will increasingly have to outsource collateral management because it is becoming more difficult to do inhouse.“Collateral management is becoming more complex and more time-consuming. If [asset managers] don’t have infrastructure in place, buying technology is massively expensive. There is also a huge amount of pending legislation that will potentially change the whole marketplace.“Therefore [institutions] are going to have to spend more money to keep operations, technology and processes in line with the future regulatory and best practices.”Mr Wilson adds that the biggest changes are coming out of the Dodd-Frank legislation in the US, where a wide variety of derivative transactions will be required to be settled via a clearing house as opposed to bilaterally.“That is going to change the operating paradigm completely,” he says.“It’s certainly going to be a big contributor in reducing risk in the marketplace but can also add a huge level of complexity for an asset manager who has multiple counterparties. Therefore you need to update your technology to deal with all those different scenarios.”"
465;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-14T18:55:29Z;Dollar fall sparks stability warnings;;The dollar tumbled against most major currencies on Thursday, prompting warnings that the weakness of the world’s reserve currency could destabilise the global economy and push other countries into retaliatory devaluations to underwrite their exports.Increasing expectations the Federal Reserve will pump more money into the US economy next month under a policy known as quantitative easing sent the dollar to new lows against the Chinese renminbi, Swiss franc and Australian dollar. It dropped to a 15-year low against the yen and an eight-month low against the euro.The dollar index, which tracks a basket of currencies, reached its lowest level this year.A senior European policy-maker, who asked not to be named, said a further aggressive round of monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve would be “irresponsible” as it made US exports more competitive at the expense of its rivals.Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist for BNY Mellon, said: “In narrow terms, the US is winning the currency wars as a weaker dollar will help its economy, but it could damage the other big economic blocs of China, Japan and Europe.”The dollar’s fall was given fresh impetus after the Monetary Authority of Singapore surprised the market when it tightened policy by widening the trading band for its currency, allowing it to appreciate. The move by the Singapore authorities, responding to fears over inflation, helped push up other Asian currencies.Russia’s finance minister Alexei Kudrin, in a meeting with European Union officials, blamed the US – and others – for global currency instability.He said one reason for exchange rate turmoil “is the stimulating monetary policy of some developed countries, above all the United States, which are trying to solve their structural problems in this way”.Commodities, which are mostly traded in dollars, were boosted by the US currency’s slide. Copper hit a two-year high of $8,490 per tonne at one point, while gold surged to a record of $1,387 per troy ounce.The twice-yearly US Treasury currency report, to be published on Friday, could ramp up the debate, although it is likely to stop short of accusing China of manipulating its currency.However, turbulence was contained in the currency markets, as equities are benefiting from expectations of more QE. Investors hope that the fresh flood of money will find its way into stocks.The QE factor and the strong start to the US earnings season propelled the FTSE All World Index to highs last seen around the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. This index has risen 20 per cent since the start of July.Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC, said: “The equity bull run, which started in March last year, will go on.”US inflation expectations for the next 10 years also continued to climb, reaching 2.09 per cent, up from 1.90 per cent in the past week.The dollar fell to Rmb6.6493 against the Chinese renminbi, dropped to SFr0.9461 against the Swiss franc and fell to $0.9993 against the Australian dollar, just shy of parity. The Canadian dollar reached parity with the US currency, last seen in April. The US dollar fell below Y81 against the Japanese yen and tumbled to $1.4121 against the euro. The dollar index dropped nearly 1 per cent at one point to 76.259, its lowest since December.
466;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-12T22:31:05Z;Backing the euro or greenback;Eurozone problems may override danger of dollar debasement;"Tim Geithner has been remarkably quiet about the need for a strong dollar recently. The US Treasury secretary appears to have last talked about the strong dollar back in February, when he revealed that he created the strong dollar policy in 1995, while working for President Bill Clinton. It is hard to detect any evidence of the policy but on Tuesday there was at least a pause in the dollar’s fall.Talk now is of whether the dollar is oversold. The dollar index has, after all, fallen 6 per cent in five weeks, and the currency is testing record lows against the yen.Yet traders have not taken the extreme positions usually seen just before a snap back in foreign exchange.Speculators in the futures market are net short the dollar, for the first time in a year; but bets against the dollar remain far lower than the summer of 2009, let alone 2007. Real money has also been shifting out of the dollar, according to Bank of New York Mellon data; not surprising given the investment flows into emerging markets. There is plenty of scope for more dollar bears to emerge among speculators, while flows to the developing world show no sign of slowing.The dollar has few sources of support. Fears of more quantitative easing in Britain have kept the pound in check; any sign that the European Central Bank might follow suit, or the Bank of Japan get serious in its efforts, and the dollar’s slide could be halted. Neither is likely.More plausible is a rerun of the competition to find the prettiest of the ugly sisters. With Britain’s austerity, the eurozone’s periphery, Japan’s debt and America’s forthcoming QE2, the choice is tough. For now, traders are blocking out the hideous economies of Greece, Ireland and Portugal as they worry about the unsightly QE2. When they remember the eurozone’s problems, potential defaults in the euro may once again override the danger of debasement of the dollar."
467;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-12T19:13:22Z;Currency race that everyone is trying to lose;Intervention is failing to have the desired effect;For all the talk of global currency wars in recent weeks, central banks have had little success in reining in their rising currencies against the sliding dollar.The overriding theme in currency markets remains one of dollar weakness as investors await an expected extension of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing programme at its policy meeting next month.The dollar’s lurch lower – it has dropped more than 6 per cent on a trade-weighted basis since the start of September – has prompted central banks of emerging markets across Asia to intervene more aggressively to stem gains in their currencies to protect exporters. Between September 27 and October 11, central banks in South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Taiwan collectively purchased $28.74bn, according to estimates by IFR Markets.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon estimates that the scale of intervention from these central banks means they have accumulated foreign exchange reserves at between two and six times normal rates in recent weeks. But despite this, the South Korean won has climbed 5.7 per cent against the dollar since the start of September, while the Malaysian ringgit has gained 1.3 per cent and the Thai baht 4.3 per cent. Meanwhile, China has allowed the renminbi to rise by 2 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of last month.The weakness of the dollar also prompted the Bank of Japan to intervene to cap gains in the yen for the first time since 2004. But, despite an initial fall in the yen when Tokyo intervened on September 15, the Japanese currency has continued its rise against the dollar, this week posting a 15-year high of Y81.36.Many had believed that the Y83 level was a line in the sand for the Japanese authorities, since it was a break of this level that seemed to trigger intervention last month. But Tokyo has so far failed to intervene again since mid-September, seeking to distinguish itself from other countries in Asia. Yoshihiko Noda, Japanese finance minister, despite issuing a warning that Tokyo was prepared to take “bold action” on the currency markets, stressed that Japan was not going down the route of sustained aggressive intervention to gain a competitive edge.So far, Japan has spent $25bn in an attempt to weaken the yen. In contrast, the top eight Asian foreign exchange reserve holders, excluding China, have amassed about $400bn worth of reserves from activity on the currency market to stem strength in their currencies since the summer of 2007. China’s stockpiles, meanwhile, have increased by over $1,000bn.Given Japan’s more cautious approach to intervention, Derek Halpenny at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ says the prospects for a fall in the dollar against the yen to the record low of Y79.95 it hit in April 1995 have increased markedly.Analysts warn that the failure of Tokyo to follow up its September move could leave its intervention a costly failure, much like the Swiss National Bank’s action to stem the rise of the franc against the euro in 2009 and the first half of 2010. Although initially successful, the SNB abandoned its intervention and racked up a paper loss of SFr14.3bn as it tried to fight a sliding euro.Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank says that by not having drawn a line in the sand for dollar weakness against the yen, markets will read this as a sign that Tokyo will continue to intervene at lower and lower levels in dollar/yen.This policy of “leaning against the wind”, he says, means that Tokyo has accepted the general direction of the market, implying that the Bank of Japan will generate losses on its intervention strategy. But Mr Leuchtmann says the policy is a mistake, since it will encourage speculators to take on the Bank of Japan.“Every loss for the BoJ is a profit for someone else in the FX market,” he says. “The more the BoJ generates this kind of profit for those who bet against it, the more attractive this strategy becomes for all speculators. In an environment of general dollar weakness, we wouldn’t be surprised to see levels below Y80 in dollar/yen soon,” he says.Analysts also expect further weakness in the dollar against the euro, which is in no small part because of the actions of emerging markets’ central banks.Although the euro has benefited from the prospect that the European Central Bank, unlike other major central banks, is not about to engage in quantitative easing, analysts say buying from central bank reserve managers, principally in Asia, has been the main driving force behind the single currency’s rise.Indeed the euro has soared over 9 per cent higher against the dollar, last week hitting an eight-month high above $1.40.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon says that since emerging markets’ central banks have been intervening on a significantly larger scale in recent weeks, they have had an increasing need to diversify their foreign exchange reserves away from the dollar in order to maintain the balance of their stockpiles.This has, by default, propelled the single currency higher. “The euro is the only real alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency,” he says. “As long as emerging markets’ central banks keep intervening to stem their currencies’ strength against the dollar, the euro will keep rising.”
468;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-11T22:23:00Z;Equities buoyed by hopes of more bank easing;;Global equities edged up to five-month highs and gold closed above $1,350 a troy ounce for the first time as investors looked to further easing by central banks amid worries of a currency war heating up.Trading flows on Monday were light with Japan, the US and Canada observing national holidays.After the weekend meeting of the International Monetary Fund failed to resolve tensions between global exchange rates, there was brief selling of the dollar. Chinese officials rejected calls for a significantly stronger renminbi and criticised western economies for their monetary expansion and zero interest rate policies.“If the intention of the IMF steering committee was to present a unified front on currency matters then it appears that they have failed,” said Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.With the US and China failing to reach an accord about their currencies, he said: “Heightened US dollar weakness, increased capital flows into emerging markets, increased intervention, possibly from Japan as well, and diversification will be the order of the day.”In New York, in the currency market, the dollar had pared early losses and was trading 0.3 per cent firmer on a trade-weighted basis, a 10-month low. Earlier, the euro briefly rose above $1.40 and the Japanese yen reached a 15-year high.For now, the weaker dollar and rise in commodity prices is being cheered by equity investors.After lacklustre US employment data last week, investors are viewing bad news through the prism of it leading to a further round of quantitative easing, or QE, by the Federal Reserve. Other central banks are also expected to keep the monetary taps on in the coming months.“It now appears that we are approaching a new peak, where fear is being banished from investor thinking, helped by a belief that all will be made whole in the broken world economy by the actions of central banks,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.Economists at Barclays Capital expect the Fed will announce a programme of incremental asset purchases targeting about $100bn of Treasury bond buying each month. The length of the programme will probably be linked to improvement in economic data.Late in New York, global equities held in positive territory with the FTSE All World index up 0.1 per cent at its highest level since April. The S&P 500 closed a fraction lower, while in Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed 0.3 per cent higher.Stocks in Turkey rose 2.7 per cent to a record after the government’s midterm economic plan forecast higher growth and a reduced budget deficitIn Asia, Shanghai rallied 2.5 per cent and Hong Kong gained 1.2 per cent to a 26-month peak. After Asian markets closed it was reported that Beijing had raised reserve requirements for six big banks by 50 basis points in order to drain liquidity.In bond trading, US and Japan were closed, and that left the focus on the eurozone, as yields for peripheral countries’ debt dropped. The yield on Greek 10-year debt was down 50bp at 9.17 per cent, while Portugal 10-year paper was 9bp lower at 6.03 per cent and Ireland’s 10-year yield fell 6bp to 6.31 per cent.The yield on 10-year German Bunds was up 1bp at 2.27 per cent.Funding pressures in the interbank market continued to tighten with three-month Euribor edging up to 0.977 per cent, its highest level since July 2009 as support for bank lending from the European Central Bank has been scaled back.In economic news, French industrial production was unchanged during August, while it climbed by 1.6 per cent in Italy, the fastest pace in seven months.Trading in commodities was dominated by a further surge in grain prices.That helped push the CRB index up 0.4 per cent to a fresh two-year high.The index has climbed 6.5 per cent since the Fed’s September policy meeting.US crude oil fell 45 cents to settle at $82.21 a barrel. ICE Brent closed down 31 cents at $83.72 a barrel.Spot gold was at $1,353 a troy ounce.
469;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-07T19:26:16Z;FTSE closes down on profit taking;;"The London market closed lower as mining stocks were hit by profit-taking, putting Antofagasta, the Chilean copper producer, among the biggest fallers.Its shares lost 4.9 per cent to £12.49 after Citigroup advised clients to “sell”.“We still think Antofagasta offers the highest-quality leverage to copper prices in our UK coverage,” the broker said.“However, its strong recent performance means we see better opportunities elsewhere in the sector.”Anglo American and Xstrata are Citi’s top picks for investors seeking copper exposure. However, they both closed lower – down 3.2 per cent at £26.64 and 2 per cent at £12.60 respectively – as metals prices dipped.Kazakhmys was also under pressure after Credit Suisse placed 9.35m shares at £14.10 each for the family of Vladimir Ni, a non-executive director who died in the summer.Earlier this week, Vladimir Kim, the chairman of Kazakhmys, sold an 11 per cent stake in the Kazakh copper miner for $1.3bn (£8bn) and said he might sell more shares if the company decided to go ahead with a secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Kazakhmys ended 5.6 per cent cheaper at £14, while a fall in the price of gold weighed on African Barrick Gold, down 4.4 per cent at 610p, and Randgold Resources, 3.2 per cent cheaper at £63.75.Those falls combined to send the FTSE 100 down 19.2 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,662.13. However, Marks and Spencer defied the weak market trend, rising 4.9 per cent to 410p, after reporting better than expected sales growth for the second quarter.Man Group added 5.1 per cent to 249.8p as rumours of a 390p a share bid approach from Bank of New York Mellon did the rounds. Last week Robert Kelly, BNY Mellon’s chief executive, said he was on the lookout for asset management companies to buy.Housebuilding stocks dragged the FTSE 250 down 34.6 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 10,765.6. Barratt Developments fell 4.5 per cent to 94.8p, while Bovis Homes Group lost 3 per cent to 373p. Persimmon dipped 4.2 per cent to 376½p after Halifax said house prices had fallen 3.6 per cent in September.“While the September drop . . . likely overstates the weakness of the housing market, there seems little doubt that [it] is now in reverse,” said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight.The house price data also unsettled mortgage lenders Lloyds Banking Group, down 3.2 per cent to 73.9p, and RBS, off 3.4 per cent to 47.8p.Barclays, down 0.9 per cent to 304p, also closed lower. The fall was triggered by speculation that UBS had lowered forecasts following a meeting with the bank.The downgrade was said to have been triggered by concerns about the performance of Barclays Capital; namely rising costs and weak market conditions.After the market closed, Nomura said it was placing 220m shares in Barclays as part of a hedging agreement with Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi.Petropavlovsk dipped 5.8 per cent to £10.71 after the Russian mining group said it was reviewing schedules at its Pioneer mine because two excavators had yet to be delivered. “As the company has consistently stated, the 2010 production target represents a 38 per cent increase on 2009 production and . . . this requires significant operational achievements throughout the year, particularly in the fourth quarter,” the company warned.Petropavlovsk shares were also weighed down by reports that the flotation of its iron ore division IRC had been delayed.Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial adviser, fell 4 per cent to 452p after co-founder Stephen Lansdown sold 13.5m shares at 429p, reducing his holding to 20.1 per cent.There was heavy trading volume in ITV, up 3.6 per cent to 63¾p, on rumours the broadcaster might reinstate its dividend. While a move to rejoin the dividend list would send a very powerful message to the investment community, analysts said ITV needed to make further progress with its transformation plan before paying a dividend.Norcros, the showers and tiles company, rose 2.3 per cent to 11¼p after it said it was expecting a return to profitability in the first half and was likely to restore its dividend.The group signalled a 12.3 per cent increase in like-for-like revenue to about £93.2m in the 27-week period to October 3.African Eagle Resources, focused on southeastern Africa, rose 10.8 per cent to 5¼p after it announced a rise of 13 per cent in the amount of nickel at its Dutwa project in Tanzania.The company believes there is 917,000 tonnes, and the geological contractor has raised the average grade to 0.93 per cent nickel.“With other aspects of the ongoing feasibility study proceeding well, such as collection of a bulk tonnage sample for the next stage of metallurgical test work, the momentum continues to build,” Seymour Pierce said.Metallurgical engineering company MDM Engineering was up 4.8 per cent to 133p after it was granted the bankable feasibility study for explorer Metorex’s Kinsenda project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The project has been delayed for two years.Rutile and ilmenite producer Titanium Resources rose 36.7 per cent to 10½p after its longstanding dispute with Sierra Leone over debt was resolved through an equity-for-debt agreement.The deal will see the £13.6m lent by the government to Titanium turned into shares.That will give the government a 23 per cent stake in the company.Oil and gas exploration and production company Antrim Energy rose 12.8 per cent to 71p after it announced a joint venture with Premier Oil to develop its Fyne asset in the North Sea.Premier will pay an initial consideration of $2m to Antrim.Clarkson Hill, the financial adviser, surged 50 per cent to 3p after it said it had received a bid approach."
470;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Gulf urged to attract long-term investors;Region missing out on capital flows;International capital has flooded into emerging market-focused funds this year as investors chase higher returns in faster-growing economies. Yet more exotic markets, such as the Gulf’s bourses, are largely being passed by and continue to languish.Emerging market equity funds have seen inflows of $50bn in the first nine months of the year, says EPFR, a data provider. This has helped MSCI Barra’s emerging markets index to gain 21 per cent over the past 12 months.While Egypt, an emerging market, has seen a net inflow of $876m this year, according to EFG-Hermes, the Gulf has seen net international capital outflows of $83m. As a result, the MSCI Gulf index, excluding Saudi Arabia, has shed 1 per cent over the same period.“There is limited international participation [in the Gulf] so far,” says Fahd Iqbal, an equity strategist at EFG-Hermes. “There is interest in the US and Europe but people aren’t ready to make frontier, off-benchmark investments just yet.”This is particularly noticeable in the United Arab Emirates stock markets. Before the financial crisis, the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange and the Dubai Financial Market were the most “internationalised” regional bourses but foreign ownership has since dwindled significantly.This is largely because of the UAE’s struggling economy but also the nature of investors who were active in the country’s stock markets.Given their frontier status and volatility, longer-term investors shy away, while more flexible entities, such as hedge funds, can flit in and out of stocks on an opportunistic basis. This volatility is exacerbated by the dominance of local retail investors.To counter the preponderance of volatile capital, a recent Bank of New York Mellon report urged UAE stock markets and companies to make themselves more attractive to longer-term institutional investors.“You need to target the right type of investor. If the quoted companies don’t continue to improve corporate governance, transparency and investor relations, they will remain at the mercy of hedge funds,” says Peter Gotke, author of the report.The primary goal should be inclusion in MSCI Barra’s influential emerging markets index, says Mr Gotke. While the UAE has been added to FTSE’s “secondary emerging markets” index, the UK index provider does not have the same clout with asset managers as MSCI.The bourses have taken some steps towards an MSCI upgrade. Some companies have increased their foreign ownership cap and Dubai’s two exchanges are in the process of shifting to a “delivery versus payment” system, another obstacle that the index provider has highlighted in the past.UAE companies should also arrange more roadshows in financial hubs such as London, New York and Hong Kong, Mr Gotke argues. “Post Dubai World restructuring and the Dubai bond, this is the time for some of these companies to get their senior management involved and bang their drum.”
471;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-10-03T19:27:10Z;Economic Outlook: Investors await crucial data;US and UK statistics will be scrutinised as measures of recovery;A bumper week of data releases and policymaker meetings is poised to provide significant signs of whether the past quarter’s stellar gains for equities can be sustained.All investor eyes will be on Friday’s monthly US employment report, while earlier in the week will see a progress update on the country’s services sector, and rate-setting meetings taking place in Europe, the UK, Japan and Australia.Meanwhile, the spectre of fresh quantitative easing will hover over the market reaction in New York and London.“To suggest that these are interesting times in the financial markets is to risk understatement,” said Neil Mellor of Bank of New York Mellon. “Fortunately we have a schedule to match this coming week, with A-list data releases, central bank meetings and international policy forums to keep the market on its toes.”Friday’s US non-farm payrolls for September are expected to show a 5,000 increase in jobs following August’s 54,000 figure, an outcome that would buttress the view that the US is experiencing a weak recovery.But consensus expectations on the jobs numbers could change rapidly before Friday’s release if other US statistics come in weaker than expected, including Wednesday’s ADP employment survey.Tuesday’s ISM non-manufacturing index will be closely watched following August’s disappointing eight-month low of 51.5, with alarm bells sounding should the figure come in below 50. Expectations are for a very modest rise to 52.0.The consequences of weak US data this week could be far-reaching, said David Tinsley, of National Australia Bank.“Given the Fed’s September statement, which essentially left the door open for a further round of QE [quantitative easing] as early as November should economic data prove weaker than expected, we would expect the dollar to fall on a weaker-than- expected [non-farm payrolls] reading as markets would jump to price-in another round of balance sheet expansion.”Fresh quantitative easing is also set to be on the agenda of Thursday’s Bank of England monetary policy committee. One member, Adam Posen, has indicated a need to expand asset purchases. The committee, however, is expected to remain on hold with easing, and with interest rates at 0.5 per cent.European Central Bank rate-setters are also set to keep rates at 1 per cent.The crucial UK release will be Thursday’s industrial production figures, with expectations of a fourth consecutive rise of 0.3 per cent for August.“The evidence suggests that manufacturing growth has slowed during the third quarter, although it is still decent,” said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight.“The concern is that manufacturing activity will be increasingly pressurised by tighter fiscal policy increasingly hitting domestic demand.”
472;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-09-28T15:41:35Z;Brazilian asset management;Biggest groups scramble to get in on the game;Everything marked “Brazil” these days is hotter than a churrasqueira at Carnaval. So it is no surprise that the world’s biggest asset management groups – always susceptible to the trends of the day – are super keen to feel the heat. In fairness, South America’s largest country does have the top three attributes considered essential for a booming money management business: a strong economy, deepening financial markets and a growing population.For US firms, Brazil looks especially hot compared with opportunities at home. For example mutual fund assets under management are expected to grow by about 10 per cent annually, according to Credit Suisse, versus just 2 per cent per year in the US. In four years, 27 per cent of Brazil’s population will be middle-aged – the age bracket when folks like to put their money to work – compared with a fifth now. Meanwhile, geriatric westerners will be increasingly digging into their pension pots.As with anything red hot, however, Brazil is also difficult to touch. The industry is stitched up by local banks, which pump investment products to retail investors through their extensive branch networks. The biggest completely foreign mutual fund manager for example, BNY Mellon, is ranked 9th by assets under management, less than a tenth the size of market leader Banco do Brazil with $188bn. The sector is also fragmented and competitive, with over 200 independent managers.As Brazil develops, further barriers to foreign entry – including rules on how much locals can invest overseas – will relax. But what would really help foreign asset managers with existing relationships, as well as those seeking to enter the market, would be for locals to need their global expertise. For that, Brazilian investments need to become less attractive: bond yields fall and local equity market cool off.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
473;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-09-27T16:38:49Z;Reserves: All eyes turn to China’s foreign money mountain;;Central banks’ actions on the world’s currency markets have been one of the main driving forces behind exchange rate movements in recent years. And there are signs that China may be about to prompt a renewed bout of dollar weakness.Asian countries, most notably China, built up massive reserves as they intervened in the market to keep a lid on their currencies’ strength against the dollar in a bid to support their export sectors.Indeed, global foreign exchange reserves have more than quadrupled since the start of 2002, from just under $2,000bn to $8,400bn.China is by far the largest holder, with stockpiles of $2,454bn at the end of June – almost 30 per cent of the global total. So what China does with its reserve matters for the wider currency market.Simon Derrick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Bank of New York Mellon, points out that Chinese currency and reserve management policies have helped determine the direction of many other currencies over the past decade.“We suspect it will be this topic that will really determine how the mainstream currency markets perform throughout the remainder of the year,” he says.In particular, it is the extent to which China diversifies its vast holdings away from the dollar that will have a large bearing on the fate of the US currency.Although, the exact composition of its currency reserves is a state secret, China is thought to hold about 65 per cent of its stockpiles in dollars, and 25 per cent in euros.There has been speculation that China is also accumulating the currencies of other emerging markets in Asia, although the amounts of its purchases so far are thought to be relatively small.Ahead of the financial crisis, it was the diversification of Asian central banks away from the dollar that was a major contributor to downward pressure on the US currency, helping to push it towards a record low of about $1.60 to the euro in July 2008.Fears over the global economy in the wake of the financial crisis have, however, driven demand for the dollar as a safe haven.But there are signs that the pattern of dollar weakness seen ahead of the collapse of Lehman Brothers has started to re-emerge in recent months.Amid heightened trade friction between the US and China over the level of the renminbi, there have been increasing signs that China is concerned over its exposure to the dollar.In August, Fan Gang, head of China’s National Economic Research Institute, said: “The dollar will basically in the long run depreciate against most currencies – not only Asian currencies.”Meanwhile, Hu Xiaolian, vice-governor of the People’s Bank of China, said: “Once a reserve currency’s value becomes unstable, there will be quite large depreciation risk for assets.”There is certainly evidence that China is trimming its exposure to US assets. According to the US Treasury, China cut its holding of US government debt by $24bn to $843.7bn in June.In contrast, China has been acquiring record amounts of Japanese government debt, buying more than Y1,700bn ($20bn) of short- and long-term paper so far this year. The previous annual record was Y255.7bn in 2005.Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, says while many interpreted Japan’s recent decision to intervene and sell Y20,00bn to stem gains in the yen as a reaction to dollar weakness, it can be seen as a loud warning shot to Beijing given its record purchases of Japanese government paper.“Cynics – possibly realists – could reason that China seeks to hamper Japan’s recovery by keeping the yen excessively strong while profiting along the way via accumulating appreciating yen and gradually reducing exposure to depreciating dollars,” he says.South Korean and European government debt have also been targeted.Mr Derrick says China’s actions could prompt a renewed wave of dollar weakness, especially against the euro.“With the current evidence pointing to a fresh hardening of attitudes in China towards the US, and with the dollar still standing at relatively high levels against the euro, we wonder whether a very familiar pattern is about to re-emerge.” he says.
474;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Energy lifts US consumer prices in August;;Living costs in the US rose for the second month running in August, as prices for food and energy picked up, but flat prices for most other goods revealed little threat of inflation.Separately on Friday, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment showed confidence in the US economy waned in September, falling to the lowest level in more than a year.The consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent last month, according to labour department figures. That was in line with economists’ projections and left prices up by 1.1 per cent from the same month a year ago.The monthly increase was fuelled by a 2.3 per cent rise in energy prices and a 0.2 per cent increase in the cost of food. However, core prices, which exclude those items, were unchanged in August and have risen by just 0.9 per cent year on year.Shelter prices were flat last month and apparel prices slipped by 0.1 per cent. Meanwhile, used cars, trucks and medical care services had modest price increases.Analysts said that the tepid inflation data would do little to change Federal Reserve policy in the near term, as both inflationary and deflationary pressures appeared to be contained.“The dovish majority on the FOMC, confronted by the spectre of high unemployment, is expected to keep interest rates on hold well into 2011,” said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.The Fed has said that inflation is likely to remain “subdued” for some time and Friday’s figures buttress that argument.Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank, argues that if “soft” prices persist later this year, the Fed will probably embark on more quantitative easing measures.“It is important to get ahead of deflation pressures, or they are apt to become more entrenched,” Mr Ruskin said.Friday’s figures followed Thursday’s tepid wholesale prices, which were boosted by energy costs, but were otherwise tame.Meanwhile, consumer confidence fell from 68.9 to 66 on the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index. That was the lowest level since August 2009 and was dragged lower by dimming optimism about the economic recovery.“The various confidence measures remain deep in recession territory,” said Mike Englund, economist at Action Economics.Economists suggested that the drop, which was unexpected, reflected a decline in stock prices and lingering unemployment, but that consumer spending appeared to be holding up.John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, of RDQ Economics, noted that with five-year inflation expectations at 2.8 per cent there was no evidence of deflation risk.
475;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-09-14T15:04:52Z;Rising US retail sales lift consumer hopes;;Purchases of petrol and apparel pushed US retail sales higher in August as businesses rushed to replenish their stocks, raising hopes that less cautious consumers will help the economy avoid a second recession.August was the second month running that sales rose and the 0.4 per cent increase, which exceeded economists’ expectations, was the sharpest in five months. Compared with the same time a year ago, retail sales, as reported by the commerce department, are up by 3.6 per cent.Excluding purchases of cars, which tend to have volatile swings on a monthly basis, retail sales were up by 0.6 per cent between July and August.Retail sales are a closely watched measure of consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of economic activity in the US. With unemployment hovering near a 26-year high and home values under pressure, retrenching consumers have raised fears that a “double-dip” recession is more likely.“Retail sales in August proved a solid result, helping to allay ongoing concerns over a double-dip recession,” said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. “Evidence of renewed life in household spending suggests that market pessimism over the summer did not completely knock out the consumer.”Spending often picks up in August as “back to school” shoppers gather supplies before schools reopen. This year, several states offered tax-free shopping holidays to spur on spending.In August, sales increased at grocery stores, clothing shops and petrol stations. Demand was weaker for electronics and home furnishings.Brian Sozzi, a retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies, noted that uncertainty about tax rates, due to the looming expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the ensuing political debate over which rates to maintain, is a problem for retailers.“In the immediate future, those in the US may very well see higher income tax rates, higher taxes on capital gains, and higher medical expenditures, which explain why money is being socked away instead of being dispensed at malls and discounters,” Mr Sozzi said.Separately on Tuesday, commerce department figures showed that in July, business inventories rose by 1 per cent from the month before. That beat estimates of Wall Street analysts and was the biggest increase in two years.Year-on-year inventories have climbed by 2.4 per cent as companies have re-stocked in anticipation of growing consumer demand.Business sales also increased, rising by 0.7 per cent from June to July.
476;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-09-14T09:56:08Z;Singapore to launch ADR trading platform;;The Singapore stock exchange is preparing to launch an international board primarily trading American Depositary Receipts in Asian companies with a combined market capitalisation of more than $600bn.The board, to be named GlobalQuote, is the first of its kind in Asia and is to open on October 22 in co-operation with Nasdaq OMX, the US technology-focused exchange and the Bank of New York Mellon, which will act as the depositary bank, according to an announcement on Tuesday.GlobalQuote will offer Asian investors their first chance to buy and sell securities in Nasdaq-quoted companies such as China’s Baidu and Suntech Power Holdings through an exchange platform during the Asian day – these stocks are not listed in their home countries.SGX is also trying to attract investors trading in Asian companies listed on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges, both of which open later and close earlier than the Singapore bourse. Chew Sutat, the exchange’s head of corporate and market strategy, said the new board would give Asian investors the option of trading ADRs round the clock for the first time, as well as offering instant trading opportunities at both ends of the trading day for stocks quoted on the China exchanges.Mr Chew said the SGX expected the move to add liquidity in the stocks and for the exchange to win “a decent market share”. However, he did not expect SGX to attract business that would otherwise have been done in Hong Kong or Shanghai.The SGX said 19 ADRs would be included in the initial launch, including Aluminum Corp of China, China Mobile, PetroChina and Netease, the software company. Nine of the stocks are currently traded only in the US, with 10 listed in Hong Kong. The exchange said it hoped to eventually add Korean, Taiwanese and Indian ADRs. Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX said GlobalQuote was a “unique” platform.“We also believe it will add significant value to our US-listed companies in Asia who can increase their exposure amongst the Asian-Pacific investor community by giving them access to local companies within local trading hours,” he said.Harsh Wardhan Modi, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase in Singapore, said in a note to clients that the introduction of ADRs could increase the exchange’s trading volumes by about 5 per cent. He said the nine companies without an Asian listing had a combined average daily trading volume of $1.1bn over the past three months.GlobalQuote is one of a series of initiatives launched by SGX since the appointment in December of Magnus Böcker, a former president of Nasdaq OMX, as chief executive.SGX, which has failed to match Hong Kong as a home for listings by big Chinese companies, has significantly expanded its commodities business, and announced plans to attract high-frequency traders by building the world’s fastest trading engine and to offer bond trading to retail investors. It is also preparing to launch a “dark pool” joint venture with Chi-X, the trading platform operator.The Singapore bourse said it would also list on GlobalQuote a handful of other international stocks that are traded in but not listed in Singapore, including Genting Hong Kong, a unit of the Malaysian gaming and entertainment group, and AV Jennings, the Australian developer.
477;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-09-10T15:50:25Z;Germany adds to euro troubles;;The euro hit record lows against the Swiss franc and the Australian dollar this week as worries over the health of the eurozone financial system resurfaced to undermine the single currency.Concerns were heightened by reports that Germany’s 10 biggest banks might need another €105bn of additional capital. The onset of a renewed round of sovereign debt issuance as eurozone countries stepped up their borrowing to fund their economies added to investors’ concerns over the region. Reports suggested that eurozone governments would look to raise €80bn in September compared to €43bn in August.This fuelled renewed concerns over the ability of countries on the periphery of the eurozone to service their debt and took the spread of the yields of Irish and Portuguese government bonds over their German counterparts to record levels, surpassing the highs seen at the height of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis in May. Indeed, there was even speculation that Ireland might have to make use of the European Union’s bail-out fund.Traders said the European Central Bank stepped up its purchases of some eurozone government bonds in what appeared to be its biggest such operation since July. “The news this week has acted as a timely reminder to investors that there are no easy solutions to the eurozone’s structural problems,” said Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon.“With sentiment towards the region’s peripheral sovereign debt standing at levels last seen in May, perhaps it’s time to start turning bearish on the euro.”The euro hit a record low of SFr1.2763 against the Swiss franc on Wednesday as rising risk aversion boosted haven demand for the Swiss currency, before paring some of its losses to stand down 0.8 per cent at SFr1.2997 on the week.Over the week the euro also lost 1.5 per cent to $1.2699 against the dollar, fell 1.2 per cent to £0.8251 against the pound and dropped 1.5 per cent to Y107.00 against the yen.The euro also dropped 2.4 per cent to a record low of A$1.3730 against the Australian dollar as continuing strength in the country’s commodity-driven economy kept demand for Australia’s currency elevated.The Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates on hold at its policy meeting on Tuesday, citing fears over a global slowdown. But expectation-beating employment figures later in the week stoked speculation that the central bank would raise rates next month as Chinese demand for its raw materials remained elevated. Over the week, the Australian dollar rose to a four-month high against the US dollar, up 0.9 per cent to $0.9251.Other commodity-linked currencies also advanced, buoyed by figures showing a robust rise in Chinese imports in August. The Canadian dollar, up 0.5 per cent to C$1.0334 on the week, was given an extra boost when the Bank of Canada raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 1 per cent after its policy meeting on Wednesday, while the New Zealand dollar rose 1 per cent to $0.7284.Meanwhile, the yen rose to a 15-year high of Y83.32 against the dollar on Wednesday as rising fears over the eurozone financial system drove haven demand for the Japanese currency. The yen later gave back some of its gains to stand flat at Y84.22 over the week.
478;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Cars and petrol boost US retail sales;;US consumers resisted purchases of discretionary items in July and steered their spending towards cars and petrol, reinforcing concerns that shoppers remain reluctant amid a sluggish economic recovery.For the first time in three months, retail sales rose, boosted by a revived car sector, commerce department figures showed on Friday. Separate reports showed energy prices fuelling the first rise in the cost of living since March and a modest brightening in consumer sentiment.Retail sales climbed by 0.4 per cent from June to July – slightly lower than Wall Street analysts’ expectations – and left sales up 5.5 per cent from the same month a year ago.The increase in July was driven by a 1.6 per cent jump in car sales and a 2.3 per cent rise in sales at petrol stations. But shoppers spent less on clothing, sporting goods, electronics and furniture, and sales excluding cars and petrol were off by 0.1 per cent.“The details proved weaker than the headline numbers suggested, with US data continuing to reflect slowing growth conditions amidst high unemployment and low consumer confidence,” said Michael Woolfolk, strategist at BNY Mellon.Consumer confidence remains depressed but did manage to stage a small recovery in early August, with sentiment ticking up ahead of the crucial back-to-school shopping season.The mixed sales performance in July was foreshadowed last week by US retailers, who reported subdued consumer demand in spite of more aggressive discounting and promotions.However, carmakers such as General Motors and Ford helped lift new car sales to their highest level this year as drivers with fresh access to credit abandoned their clunkers for new models.Meanwhile, the consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent in July. This was the first increase in the past four months, leaving prices up 1.2 per cent year-on-year, and was largely the result of rising energy prices and increases in prices of cars, apparel and rent.The labour department noted that rents were starting to rise in the north-east, as vacancy rates fell and homeowners with negative equity shifted from houses to apartments.Still, inflation remained mostly muted in July. The closely watched core CPI, which factors out volatile price swings in food and energy, rose by a tepid 0.1 per cent last month and has risen by just 0.9 per cent in the last year.The monthly increase should help to ease growing fears that deflation is looming but is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve’s inflation projections. The Fed said in its latest statement that “inflation is likely to be subdued for some time” as resource slack restrains cost pressures.
479;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-08-12T21:29:11Z;Euro falls as debt worries resurface;Swiss franc surges higher on haven demand;The euro lost ground on Thursday as worries over European government debt resurfaced and weak eurozone industrial production raised further concerns over the health of the region’s economy.The dollar and the yen surged higher across the board on Wednesday as fears over global growth prompted by a downgrade of the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the US economy stoked haven demand for both currencies.But it was the euro that bore the brunt of the selling, dropping more than 2.5 per cent against the dollar as fears over the credit problems of countries on the periphery of the eurozone returned.The single currency suffered as the spreads on the yield of Greek, Irish, Spanish and Portuguese government bonds over their German equivalents all widened and the cost of insuring against their governments defaulting on their debts rose.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said it seemed that the negative implications for the export-orientated eurozone implied by the Fed’s gloomy assessment of the economy had stirred simmering tensions in the region’s debt market.He said it was possible that the rally in the euro that pushed the single currency to a three-month high of $1.3333 against the dollar last week might have run its course. Mr Mellor said there were clearly issues to be resolved as far as the eurozone’s debt problems were concerned.“In view of the profound impact such concerns had over the first half of the year, it would be remiss to ignore the possibility that we have seen the peak in the euro against the dollar for the time being,” he said.The euro fell further on Thursday, dropping to a low of $1.2779, its weakest level in three weeks, after a surp­rise drop in eurozone industrial production in June heaped more pressure on the single currency. The euro recovered some poise to stand down 0.2 per cent at $1.2837 against the dollar late in New York.The Swiss franc was the strongest performer, rising 1.2 per cent to SFr1.3469 against the euro and climbing 1 per cent to SFr1.0492 against the dollar.Robert Lynch at HSBC said the “safe haven” attributes of the Swiss franc had reasserted themselves as investors requiring exposure to Europe but not wanting to hold euros had moved back into the currency.Meanwhile, the yen endured a volatile session holding close to a 15-year high against the dollar as speculation over possible intervention from the Japanese authorities to stem the strength of its currency intensified.The yen, which hit a high of Y84.71 against the dollar on Wednesday, eased 0.7 per cent to Y85.02 against the dollar.
480;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-08-11T22:07:08Z;Man Group dogged by series of setbacks;;Man Group, one of the UK’s largest hedge fund managers, has endured an unaccustomed run of bad news of late.For so long the most prominent symbol of the growth of London’s hedge fund sector, Man is now facing accusations that AHL, its flagship fund, is “broken” following a period of poor performance.It has also experienced a number of personnel departures and has seen its proposed $1.6bn (£1bn) acquisition of rival GLG Partners criticised as too expensive.In response to the difficulties, Man’s shares have fallen 31 per cent in 2010, making the company the subject of bid rumours. Bank of New York Mellon is the most recent potential buyer to be linked, although analysts and people close to the company dismiss the idea.With the shares at 212p, Man is trading at slightly more than 9 times forecast 2011 earnings, while rival fund managers trade at nearer 10 times. Analysts say the discount implies problems with AHL, the computer-driven fund that contributes up to three-quarters of the group’s profits.“On our estimates the market attributes a 50 per cent probability of AHL being ‘broken’ ” analysts at UBS wrote last month.There is a growing sense that Man is being hard done by. As UBS’s team has pointed out, AHL has hardly been floundering, of late: “Year to date, AHL has outperformed the HFRI, managed futures and stocks,” they wrote.The notion that Man is “in trouble” has become ingrained as a familiar market theme – not least in the US, where the proposed takeover of GLG Partners has catapulted the previously low-key Man into the limelight.Last month, the departure of eight mid-level analysts was described by some as an “exodus” from the group. But the eight in question turned out to have departed over a six-month period. AHL has actually seen its headline headcount rise, up 8 per cent so far this year, to about 125.That such stories garner attention is because of a broader, more fundamental issue, however.AHL dropped by 16.9 per cent last year – not just its biggest annual loss, but its only annual loss, leading to fears that the fund was irreparably damaged.The company blames quantitative easing and unusual market behaviour for the loss, and says that there was no reason to change AHL’s underlying model. Its modellers are confident it will make the money back.Indeed, AHL‘s peer group of so-called “managed futures” funds – which use computer algorithms to spot and ride out market trends across an array of futures contracts – all performed badly in 2009, yet few are asking whether the managed futures model itself is broken.Over the 2008 and 2009 period as a whole, AHL is up 8 per cent. The average hedge fund is still down 4 per cent, according to Hedge Fund Research.So far this year, AHL is up 3.9 per cent – partially on the back of significant gains in the past two weeks.Part of Man’s problem is the natural volatility inherent in AHL’s computer-driven strategy.AHL’s performance has a disproportionate effect on the assets it manages because so many of its investors have their money in the fund through specially designed, often leveraged, structured products designed by Man’s formidable sales team.Analysts have estimated that every 1 percentage point performance swing at AHL accounts for a 3 per cent swing in assets under management as a result.Poor performance for AHL in the first few months of the year, as well as the negative effects of currency movements, consequently gave succour to many of the fears about AHL.In addition, while Man has been talking of inflows for some time, so far they have yet to materialise. More than $1.5bn has been committed to the company, but frustratingly for Man executives, only 5 per cent of that has so far materialised. Gross institutional outflows over the three months to the end of June, at $600m, are meanwhile at their lowest quarterly level in three years.If the problems with AHL are surmountable, however, they are still unwelcome, and have highlighted just how important the fund is to the company as a whole.It is a desire to reduce that importance that has led Man to expand the range of funds it offers and, more recently, launch the bid for rival GLG Partners, which has $23bn under management.A deal would be very much a marriage of convenience. GLG, whose funds are based on star managers rather than computer programmes, will remain ensconced in its Curzon Street office in London’s Mayfair rather than moving to Man’s City headquarters.There will be sales benefits, with Man’s salespeople blending the range of GLG funds into their existing products and packages.Executives at both companies are banking that the autonomy of GLG will be the key to the success of the relationship. With Man’s meeting to approve the move set for September 1, all that remains is to convince shareholders.
481;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-08-03T22:16:45Z;Bond price action paints misleading picture;Fixed-income flow data tell more ambiguous tale;"This financial environment is conducive to a sharp pick-up in global merger and acquisition activity and share buy-backs, says Andrew Garthwaite, global equity strategist at Credit Suisse.He highlights several reasons for this view. “First, valuations are compelling – there is a record gap between the free cash flow yield and the corporate bond yield. We regard this gap as a proxy for the economic attractiveness of M&A.”Second, Mr Garthwaite says, corporate leverage is back to average levels. “Just over 50 per cent of US and UK market capitalisation has a net debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation ratio of below one times; and corporate cash positions are close to record highs.”Third, business confidence remains high. “In Credit Suisse’s recent proprietary survey of European companies’ attitude towards corporate spending, the majority of respondents said they were more likely to increase M&A activity than to pay down debt or increase dividends.“Plus, M&A tends to lag behind the stock market and the economic cycle by 12 months – suggesting a pick-up is overdue. M&A activity is close to all-time lows as a proportion of market cap and gross domestic product.“Share buy-backs should also rise – taxation now favours buy-backs, relative to dividends, in most countries.”"
482;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-08-03T18:36:42Z;Singapore dollar hovers near record highs;Asian currencies continue their strong run;Asian currencies continued their strong run as the rising oil price and growing optimism about the strength of emerging economies relative to the US buoyed sentiment.The Singapore dollar hovered near all-time highs against the US dollar, albeit ending the day slightly weaker at S$1.35. The Malaysian ringgit remained close to its two-year peak, trading at M$3.151 to the greenback by late afternoon in London. And the Indonesian rupiah rose to within reach of a three-year high of Rp8,930 to the dollar.Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Crédit Agricole, said: “Recent data from India, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand has shown that inflation is on the rise. People are speculating that there will be further monetary tightening and this is providing yield support for the currencies.”The oil price has risen to a three-month peak of more than $82 a barrel, while the price of wheat has jumped nearly 60 per cent since late June. “The past [two days] have seen risk assets move sharply to the topside, with equities and commodities rallying impressively,” said Barclays Capital strategists.Mr Kowalczyk said: “In emerging Asia, we are seeing huge inflows of money. Despite large volumes of central bank dollar buying, regional currencies are still strengthening – so strong is the inflow of capital to emerging Asia.”The strength of a number of currencies across emerging Asia raised the prospect of government intervention, analysts said.The yen’s move towards a 15-year high at Y84.8 led many to suggest that Japanese policymakers might intervene. The Japanese currency hit an eight-month peak of Y85.69 to the dollar.Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London, said: “They will be concerned if it goes below the lows of the last couple of years.”There was also talk that the Bank of Korea had been intervening to slow the won’s rise. The South Korean central bank said its foreign exchange reserves increased by $11.7bn in July. It added that the rise was “mainly attributable to an increase in the operating profits on the foreign reserves and a sharp rise in the US dollar translation values of euro- and pound-denominated reserves in line with the strength of those currencies against the dollar”.The Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates on hold at 4.5 per cent. “With growth likely to be close to trend, inflation close to target and the global outlook remaining somewhat uncertain, the board judged this setting of monetary policy to be appropriate,” it said.The Australian dollar was flat at $0.9125 versus the US dollar.
483;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-08-02T19:31:35Z;Sterling surges to highest level in 10 months;Robust banks’ earnings and data fuel economic optimism;Sterling on Monday surged to its highest level in more than 10 months on a trade-weighted basis as robust earnings from banks and buoyant manufacturing data fuelled optimism about the UK economy.The pound rose 1.4 per cent to a peak of $1.5908 against the dollar – its highest in six months versus the US currency – by late afternoon in London. The Bank of England’s trade-weighted index, which tracks the pound against a basket of currencies, gained 0.85 per cent to its highest level since September 2009.Results from HSBC showing pre-tax profit more than doubled in the first half of the year reinforced expectations that the banking sector would have a bumper earnings season, with other large UK banks due to report later in the week.In addition, a survey of British purchasing managers showed higher-than-expected growth in the country’s manufacturing industry. The renewed optimism surrounding sterling marks a considerable turnround from earlier this year, when the pound dropped below $1.43 after the general election resulted in a hung parliament, raising concerns that the new government would lack the political heft to tackle the ballooning budget deficit seriously.Since then, however, traders have rushed to cover their bets against the pound as a tough emergency budget and unexpectedly strong growth in the second quarter upgraded the outlook for the economy, pushing sterling 11.5 per cent higher against the dollar in two-and-a-half months.“It’s becoming easier to see how the woeful bears are packing up their bags and quitting the scene, driving the pound higher as they do,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.“There’s a lot of positivity in the market at the moment,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. But he added that the pound’s strength had been exaggerated by dollar weakness: “Things are not that rosy at the moment in the US.”The Bank of England, which is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on Thursday, has been notably cautious on the British economy. Last week Mervyn King, Bank governor, said he feared there was “some considerable distance to travel before we can begin to use the word ‘normal’”.Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said that “mixed messages coming from the Bank of England regarding inflation and possible rate adjustments” had aided the pound’s rally.Analysts warned that Britain’s currency, along with its economy, still faced considerable headwinds. Strategists at BNP Paribas said sterling looked “overcrowded”.“We expect limited upside in the pound against the dollar from here for two main reasons: positive UK data has peaked and empirical evidence suggests overcrowding in the carry trade,” they said.Indeed, the currency’s strength might crimp the nascent recovery. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, the consultancy, said: “It still seems highly likely that manufacturers will see softer growth over the coming months.”
484;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-08-01T07:42:56Z;Securitising life policies has real dangers;;Investors buying bonds based on traded life policies could expose themselves to unknown risks, warns a report on the asset class.The market for traded life policies (TLPs) – the second-hand life assurance policies of elderly and dying Americans – has ballooned to $30bn (£19bn, €23bn), from less than $2bn in 2002, according to estimates by Conning Research & Consulting.A swathe of banks, including Citi, BNY Mellon, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and HSBC are clamouring to enter the sector, said Merlin Stone, visiting professor at the UK’s Oxford Brookes, De Montfort and Ports­mouth universities.However, he warned in a survey of the industry*, commissioned by Managing Partners Ltd, a specialist traded life policy fund manager, that TLPs were too complicated for investors to be sure they would behave as expected if they were securitised in a special purpose vehicle, as is becoming more common.“Securitisation offers what looks, to the buyer, like a solid asset that has the benefit of spreading risk over a long period, [but] it’s riskier when the underlying assets are not well understood,” he said.“Regulators are particularly worried about securitisation,” he added.Life policies are sold by the original policyholders so they can realise some of the benefits in their lifetimes. The new owner pays the rest of the premia and collects the cash when the original owner dies.However, Mr Stone argued that securitisation vehicles were illiquid, expensive to set up and faced problems with what to do with policies that have not matured once the fixed term has expired.“Transparency is always best for the investor and at the moment, there is a choice between straightforward funds and these complicated vehicles,” said Mr Stone, who argued the risk was heightened by TLPs being a relatively new asset class.The US market for TLPs developed in the 1990s when early Aids sufferers cashed in life policies in order to pay for medical care. The market has changed significantly since, in particular with a distinction being drawn between policies with such short life expectancies – “viaticals” – and those of senior citizens with longer but more predictable life expectancies.Typically, the policy is sold when the original owner is over 65, so has a life expectancy that can be estimated with relative precision. This is important because how long the seller lives is the key variable that defines the value of the policy.If the subject lives longer than predicted, the investor has to pay premia longer than expected, creating a larger liability and reducing the return on investment.The primary challenge for all investment products based on TLPs is to manage this risk through scrutiny of individual policies combined with diversification.However, the behaviour of the asset class is still opaque, even to experts. In 2008, the actuarial tables on which valuations are based had to be altered to accommodate fresh data on life expectancy.“It takes a long time for a market to become mature enough to be both well regulated and well understood,” said Mr Stone.In the meantime, he feared the growing popularity of securitisations could cause regulators to apply a heavy hand to development of the asset class, particularly after the debacle surrounding mortgage securitisations that helped trigger the credit crisis.*The Merlin Stone report: the market for traded life policies.
485;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-30T21:22:47Z;Weak growth weighs on dollar;Mounting concerns about the US economy;The dollar fell below Y86 for the first time in eight months on Friday as mounting concerns about the US economy led to broader weakness for the greenback.The slightly weaker than expected data on second-quarter US growth were the trigger for the latest move downward, but traders were also looking ahead to manufacturing and employment data next week that are expected to point to further weakness in the world’s largest economy.The US dollar fell to a low of Y85.93 before recovering to Y86.63 later in the day, down 0.9 per cent against the Japanese currency on the week.Apart from two trading days in November last year, the Japanese currency is at its strongest against the dollar since 1995. There is speculation that it could test its 14-year peak of Y84.80, reached in November, or even the record high against the dollar of Y79.70 it hit in 1995. The sharp rise in the yen has put investors on alert for a possible currency intervention by the Japanese authorities, with some citing Y85 as a level at which Tokyo might intervene. “Certainly we cannot imagine the [Finance] Ministry remaining quiet as [the] US dollar-yen rate probes the year-to-date lows,” said Simon Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.Yoshihiko Noda, the Japanese finance minister, on Friday said he was watching the foreign exchange market closely, although a government panel said monetary policy easing, rather than direct intervention, was the best way to deal with the currency’s strength.Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “At the end of a week in which investors have preferred strengthening company earnings, the spectre of a further deterioration in the backdrop caused demand for the yen.”The yen’s strength came as the dollar fell against a broad range of currencies: on a trade-weighted basis it was down 0.9 per cent over the week.Weaker-than-expected data on durable goods orders and a downbeat survey on manufacturing conditions from the Federal Reserve contributed to the gloom surrounding the US economic recovery.Mr Derrick said the recovery was “always at risk once its various stabilisers were removed”.“The US economy’s first tentative steps are therefore unsettling and there are already audible calls for the return of quantitative easing,” he said.At the same time, the euro rallied to its highest in three months as traders became more optimistic on the prospects for the single currency, after the release of the long-awaited European bank stress tests last week produced no unpleasant surprises.However, analysts at Danske Bank sounded a note of caution on the medium-term prospects for the single currency. “We still believe investors will demand a premium for holding euros, as European debt and money markets still aren’t functioning optimally and the European banking sector remains fragile,” they said.The euro gained 0.9 per cent to $1.3025 over the week, at one point rising above $1.31. The pound was 1.5 per cent stronger at $1.5662, its highest level in five months, while the Australian dollar was up 1 per cent over the week, at a three-month peak of $0.9068
486;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;‘Active’ ETF seeks to beat global index;US fund offers exposure to managed portfolio of global equities with charges similar to an index tracker;Private investors can now gain exposure to a concentrated portfolio of global equities with charges similar to an index tracker fund, following the launch of the first actively-managed international exchange traded fund (ETF).US fund manager WCM and ETF platform AdvisorShares last week listed the WCM/BNY Mellon Focused Growth ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, quoting a management fee of 0.75 per cent, a total expense ratio of 1.25 per cent and a portfolio turn-over rate– a measure of how many holdings incur dealing costs each year – of 15 per cent. But some investment advisers and fund managers have questioned whether “active” ETFs are better value than conventional mutual funds.Like all ETFs, the WCM/BNY Mellon Focused Growth ADR fund is based on a benchmark index – in this case, the BNY Mellon Classic ADR Index, which measures the performance of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). These are negotiable US certificates equivalent to the publicly traded shares of overseas companies. However, rather than simply tracking the ADR index, the ETF aims to outperform it by holding 20-30 securities selected by an active manager, or “sub-adviser”.In the US, there are more than 20 ETFs that employ an element of active management, but these are all money market or fixed income funds. BNY Mellon claims that the Focused Growth fund is the first ever actively managed ETF with an international strategy.By structuring the investment vehicle as an ETF, rather than as a conventional mutual fund, the managers believe they are giving private investors several advantages. Trading can be carried out through UK or US brokers with “immediate pricing”, notes Julio Lugo, global head of BNY Mellon’s Depositary Receipts Structured Products. Andrew Wilson, head of investment at UK financial advisers Towry, believes this liquidity can be useful: “There is potentially some advantage in being able to trade throughout market opening hours, especially if an investor is desperate to get into or out of a market.”Fund holdings can be checked at any time as ETF portfolios must be fully disclosed. Costs can be lower, too, as many international mutual funds still have total expense ratios of more than 2 per cent a year. “Active ETFs may in some cases be cheaper than a mutual fund, especially if the investor does not want advice and hence can avoid commission,” says Wilson. ETFs also avoid capital gains tax when they have to sell holdings to meet redemptions.However, “passive” fund managers argue that active ETFs will not necessarily be better value, or better performers than index trackers. “If you look at the expense ratio and the spread [between the buying and selling price], they may not be any cheaper – and many will be more expensive,” claims Tom Rampulla, managing director of index-tracker provider Vanguard UK.ETF provider Source says there must be sufficient outperformance of an index tracker to merit the higher charges. Director MJ Lytle notes that a passive ETF split between developed and emerging markets could have an annual charge as low as 30 basis points. “Effectively, you’re paying another 45 basis points for an active strategy, he says. “Are you really going to get outperformance by 45 basis points?”BNY Mellon forecasts that active ETFs will become cheaper, and more widely used, in future.
487;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-29T21:16:26Z;Dollar lower as carry trade returns;;The dollar fell to its weakest level in three months on a trade-weighted basis on Thursday as caution on the outlook for the US economy pressured the greenback and traders’ appetite for riskier currencies increased.Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said the “summer doldrums” had seen a return of the dollar carry trade.In a carry trade, investors borrow a currency in which interest rates are low in order to buy a higher-yielding one, such as the Australian dollar or the South African rand.“The preferred strategy this summer has been the management of cash,” Mr Woolfolk said, noting that investors had lost their enthusiasm for committing money to new long positions. “As volatility has continued to ease, the carry trade has returned.”The dollar fell 0.7 per cent against a basket of currencies to its weakest level since the end of April. It is now off 8 per cent since its recent peak in June.Raghav Subbarao, foreign exchange strategist at Barclays Capital, said the dollar weakness was overdone. “On a purchasing power parity basis most currencies are now extremely overvalued against the US dollar,” he noted.But he added that “we could continue to see the US dollar holding these levels due to data-driven weakness in the short term”.In its latest Beige Book survey released on Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve noted that in two of the districts it monitored, “the pace of economic activity had slowed recently”, while in others increases had been modest.Meanwhile, the euro hit its highest level against the dollar since early May.Eurozone economic sentiment rose to its highest level since early 2008, the European Commission said, giving the area’s currency the impetus to push through the $1.31 level against the dollar to hit a peak of $1.3106, up 0.9 per cent on the day. The German government reported that unemployment in the country fell to its lowest level since 2008.The single currency has risen more than 10 per cent since early June, with the most recent leg driven by optimism after the stress tests of European banks produced no unpleasant surprises.Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar slipped after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand issued a dovish statement, saying that the strength in the currency was “inconsistent with the softening in New Zealand’s economic outlook and moderation in our export commodity prices”.The kiwi initially dropped to a low of $0.7202 on the news, before recovering to $0.7255. Against the Aussie dollar it was 0.6 per cent weaker at NZ$1.2425.
488;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-26T21:49:22Z;Euro makes progress versus the dollar;;The euro rose against the dollar on Monday as investors shrugged off concerns that Europe’s bank stress tests lacked the vigour to renew confidence in the region.Scepticism over the stress tests results – which showed that seven out of 91 banks needed extra capital – was tempered by residual optimism towards the eurozone economy based on recent encouraging economic data.CMC Markets said: “If Friday’s publication of the European bank stress tests were a Shakespearean play, they would have been Much Ado About Nothing.”Analysts from Bank of New York Mellon said: “There seems little point expressing our bemusement at the support the euro continues to enjoy in the face of the publication of the European banking stress tests.”Elsewhere, analysts questioned regulators’ use of stress test methodology that failed to take into account exposure to the “doomsday scenario” of a possible sovereign default.Fears over the mounting sovereign debt woes of peripheral eurozone members last month pushed the single currency below $1.19 – the lowest level in more than four years.Since then, the euro has rebounded by almost 10 per cent against the dollar, helped by data showing unemployment in the eurozone fell in April for the first time since April 2008.Others, however, argued that the stress test results would in the short term help lift some of the uncertainty that has hung over the single currency during the recent sovereign debt crisis.Barclays Capital said: “Although it remains to be seen whether the results . . . will be able to restore investor confidence in the euro area banking sector, the reduced uncertainty will help lower the risk premium to some degree and is marginally positive for the euro in the short term.”Late in New York, the euro had risen by 0.7 per cent against the dollar to $1.2997, and was marginally higher against the pound by 0.3 per cent to €0.8393.The euro was flat versus the Swiss franc at SFr1.3594.Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that speculators had cut net short positions against the euro by just over 10 per cent in the week up to July 20.Earlier, the euro had hit a seven-week high against the yen of Y113.49, but fell back to Y112.90 late in New York trading.Elsewhere, the dollar was down 0.7 per cent to Y86.89 against the yen late in New York.The dollar was near its session low seen after US government data showed new home sales had risen from the May data’s record low.
489;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-23T18:47:17Z;Bankers overpaid by $1.6bn during crisis;;Citigroup, Bank of America and 15 other bailed-out financial services companies overpaid their top executives by $1.6bn during the height of the financial ­crisis, according to a review by the White House’s ­special master on Wall Street compensation.Kenneth Feinberg, who was appointed last year by Barack Obama, president, to oversee the pay policies at the companies that received the greatest government support, began in March his latest inquiry into top executives’ compensation from late 2008 to early 2009.While the payments were legal at the time, Mr Feinberg said on Friday, they would have fallen foul of restrictions the government set for participants in its troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).Citi topped the list on excessive pay, thanks in large part to the compensation of several star employees at the bank’s Phibro commodities trading unit, people familiar with the matter said. Citi sold the business to Occidental Petroleum last year.“Getting our compensation structure right is a priority for us,” a Citi spokeswoman said. “Since the crisis, we have done a lot of work to make sure it is performance-based and we look forward to reviewing the special master’s recommendations.”The other companies cited by the special master were: American Express, American International Group, Boston Private Financial Holdings, Capital One Financial, CIT Group, JPMorgan Chase. M&T Bank, Morgan Stanley, Regions Financial, SunTrust Banks, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, PNC Financial Services Group, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo.While Mr Feinberg no longer had the authority to police compensation at those that had paid back the government’s investment, he used a “look back” provision in the statute to ask for more information about their pay during a window between the start of the Tarp and when new restrictions on executive pay took effect.Mr Feinberg reviewed what the 419 companies that received government assistance before February 2009 had paid their top 25 executives. The institutions were required to submit details on employees who earned more than $500,000.Eleven of the 17 companies cited by the special master have repaid the government for its assistance during the crisis. And, while Mr Feinberg conceded that none of the retention awards, bonuses, golden parachutes and other payments that appear excessive today was “contrary to the public interest”, he proposed the companies adopt a new policy that would supersede pay guarantees granted to executives.Mr Feinberg implored companies to give their boards’ compensation committees the right to restructure, reduce or cancel payments to executives during times of crisis.In October, he had moved to slash the 2009 cash compensation of the top executives at the seven companies within his jurisdiction by an average of 90 per cent from a year earlier.In December, Mr Feinberg took aim at a second tier of managers, setting a $500,000 salary limit for hundreds of employees at the companies that were still under his thumb. The White House last month appointed Mr Feinberg as administrator of BP’s fund to pay claims from the oil company’s devastating spill. He will leave his current post as “pay tsar” in August.
490;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-20T21:37:37Z;Higher stocks boost BNY Mellon and State Street;Rise in share prices offsets lower fees;Bank of New York Mellon and State Street, the two largest US custodial banks, on Tuesday said higher stock prices had boosted quarterly profits, offsetting low interest rates, which have depressed fees for large parts of their business.The increased profits were primarily due to a year-over-year gain in stock prices, which allowed the banks to charge higher fees in their asset management divisions.Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse analyst, said the results were a “mixed bag,” with stock prices are up year-over-year but down compared with the first quarter and “market and macro conditions remain challenging.”He said that new business and cost controls had been positive for State Street.BNY Mellon reported a profit of $658m, or 54 cents a share, compared with $176m, or 15 cents a share, last year. The previous year included a $236m charge for the repayment of $3bn the bank received from the Treasury’s troubled asset relief programme. Fee revenue rose 2 per cent to $2.56bn, including $13bn in net securities gains.Assets under management grew 13 per cent to $1,047bn as of June 30, compared with the same period a year ago, but declined 5 per cent compared with the end of the first quarter on March 31, as falling equity markets depressed asset values.Credit loss provisions decreased to $20m, compared with $35m in the first quarter. Non performing assets also decreased, but the total allowance for credit losses increased $7m in the period.State Street reported operating profit of $432m, or 87 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.31bn, or $7.12 a share, the prior year, which included $3.68bn in losses related to purchases of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.Total fee revenue increased 12 per cent to $1.7bn, compared with $1.5bn a year ago. Revenue on an operating basis, which totalled $2.2bn in the period, included $50m related to losses on securities investments.Assets under management rose 15 per cent to $1,782bn compared with a year ago, but fell 7.6 per cent during the second quarter as a result of tumbling stock markets.Both companies are aggressively courting new businesses. BNY Mellon recently completed the acquisition of Global Investment Servicing, which provides processing technologies to mutual funds, and is expected to close another acquisition, of BHF’s German asset servicing operations, in August.State Street said its servicing fees increased 20 per cent to $957m, “attributable primarily to new business” and “increases in daily average equity valuations”.The higher stock prices allowed BNY Mellon and State Street, which make money by holding investments and securities for clients, to collect more money for managing client funds in the quarter.
491;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-19T13:03:33Z;How to best navigate euro faultlines;;"Fears of government debt defaults in Europe seem, for the time being, to have receded and the euro has made up some lost ground.But the single currency is far from fundamentally sound. Divisions in eurozone economies remain, and the hastily put-together European Financial Stability Facility has been criticised by some as little more than a debt-shuffling exercise. Meanwhile, some investors still fear a shift in the make up China’s FX reserves.Simon Derrick, head of currency strategy at BNY Mellon, will answer your questions on the problems facing the euro and the eurozone, and offer his views on other aspects of the currency markets below.……………………………………………………………………………………….Will the changing face of Chinese currency reserves have an impact on the Euro? Will China drift away from the single currency given the political and fiscal differences dominating trade at the moment?
Elaine Harper, BrusselsSimon Derrick: Elaine, given the importance of FX reserve growth and diversification over the past decade, I think your question is absolutely central to understanding what happens next in the currency markets. As I’m sure I will get plenty of other opportunities today to discuss the outlook for the Euro (including the impact of Chinese currency policy), let me use your question to address the question of quite how Chinese FX reserve growth is actually changing.China’s foreign exchange reserves grew by just $55.1bn in the first half of 2010. This left the average monthly increase this year running at about a quarter of the level seen in 2009. Even if we strip out May’s decline of $51bn then monthly growth is still only running at just over half of what it was last year. In addition, as the FT has highlighted, the latest data from Japan’s Ministry of Finance shows that China bought a record Y735.2bn of JGBs in May. For China to have purchased $8.3bn of Japanese paper in a month when the value of its reserves actually shrank by $51bn suggests a real shift in how they look to diversify their holdings.Further evidence for this comes from MOF data showing that China purchased a net Y541bn (of mostly short-term notes) between January and April, double the record amount logged for all of 2005. This was the equivalent of 6.7 per cent of the increase seen in the value of China’s reserves during this period.Take these two simple observations together (reduced reserve growth and an increased desire to diversify) and we have a potentially major shift in the whole dynamic taking place. Although it’s too early to say whether this is a long term shift, we certainly need to keep a close eye on how things develop in the months ahead.……………………………………………………………………………………….What do you see as the trend for the next few months for the sterling/euro cross? What factors do you see shaping attitudes towards sterling in the next few months?
Dave, FranceSD: Dave, this is a subject that’s always dear to my heart. It seems to me that the key factor for sterling is that well over 50 per cent of the UK’s exports head towards the eurozone. Unfortunately, this comes at a time when substantial public spending cuts are being planned not just among the more peripheral nations but also in the very heart of the region.As a result, it seems reasonable to suppose that the eurozone will see a slowdown in economic activity. Given that this also comes at a point when GBP has been making significant gains against the euro, it seems fair to say that there will probably be a contraction in demand for UK exports to the region.The nations of the eurozone are not the only ones preparing dramatic spending cuts of course. George Osborne, has just begun work on the biggest round of Whitehall cuts since the second world war, with some cabinet ministers set to curb spending by up to 40 per cent. As such it also seems sensible to factor in a slowdown in the UK economy at the same time as the one likely to hit the eurozone. Given this, it seems to me that sterling could be in for something of a rough time in the months ahead.……………………………………………………………………………………….Do you think the euro is in danger of losing reserve currency status, and how much of the current move in the euro is being driven by short covering and other types of short term technicals ? Can it muddling through at current valuations - does it look oversold at the levels seen recently?
Christopher Dillon, Maryland, USASD: Christopher, let me answer your second question first. I would argue that the movements we have seen since early June and, particularly, over the past few days have had far less to do with investors taking a more positive view of the eurozone and rather more to do with a significant downgrading of the growth prospects for the US.It seems less than coincidental that the current move originated with the publication of the May non-farm payrolls report, which fell over 130,000 short of the consensus forecast for the month. This week’s moves were consistent with this view given that the rally in the euro/dollar came in the aftermath of the dour FOMC minutes and the news of a slowdown in China.Is the euro in danger of losing its reserve status? No, I would say not. It is, after all, one of the few currencies that has underlying markets that are deep enough to absorb the phenomenal levels of FX reserve growth experienced over the past decade. That said, much as happened to the dollar through the previous decade, the past seven months has seen a rather more realistic appreciation of what the euro actually is start to emerge (i.e. it’s the sum of all its parts, not just a replacement for the Deutschemeark).The clearest evidence for this comes from signals that the likes of Russia are looking to increase the use of currencies such as the Canadian dollar in their portfolios while China appears to have become a rather more active buyer of yen of late. In my opinion this is actually a good thing if it reduces some of the strains that have emerged in the currency markets in recent years.……………………………………………………………………………………….Some of the trends seen in currency markets over the past couple of years appear to be breaking down. The euro’s correlation to the dollar regarding risk appetite appears to be one. What shape will risk assessment take on the currency markets in the coming weeks?
David Ashmore, LincsSD: David, I definitely agree that some of the easy certainties of the past few years appear to be disappearing. Most obviously, the dollar is no longer the currency to buy when risk aversion is on the rise. This is in marked contrast to, say the second half of 2008 when the financial crisis saw the dollar soar on the currency markets as investors sought out the security of US government securities (despite the fact that the US was the epicentre of the crisis).It seems instead that the number of “credible” safe haven currencies has currently been narrowed down to just the yen and Swiss Franc (with the emphasis on the former).Is this marked change just a function of summer trading and a reassessment of the outlook for the US or is it a signal of a much deeper change taking place in the dynamics of the currency markets? I don’t know. However, I am aware of two things which suggest to me that we need to keep a close eye on how events play out in the weeks ahead. The first is that over the past thirteen years the months of July and August have often seen the start of some major trends/events (from the Russian crisis in 1998 to the crisis of 2008). The second is that I’m mindful of the slowdowns seen in China’s reserve growth this year. Although this might just prove a temporary phenomenon, reserve growth globally has played such an important role in determining how the FX markets have developed that we need to monitor this carefully.……………………………………………………………………………………….Given the deteriorating sentiment towards the dollar and the continued haven demand for the yen, at what point do you think the Japanese authorities will intervene to stop further falls in $/JPY?,
Stephen Sparks, SingaporeSD: Soon, Stephen. Above and beyond the recent coded warnings from Bank of Japan governor Shirakawa, finance minister Noda and economy minister Arai, it’s noticeable that complaints have started to emerge from the private sector as well. Notably, the chairman of the Japan Auto Manufacturers Association, Toshiyuki Shiga, warned earlier this month: “If the yen’s strength continues, there will be a negative impact on Japan’s economy. If there are any steps (the government could take), then we would like to ask.”With the Nikkei 225 coming under increasing pressure and warnings from both the IMF and Fitch about Japan’s fiscal position, the pressure is definitely on the authorities to find some way of easing the pressure. Most importantly, they will be aware that if dollar/yen manages to break much below Y85 then the market will swiftly start to target the all time lows just below Y80 hit in April 1995.I must say though that I’m not certain that this is that wise a move. The Swiss National Bank’s battle this year to stop the franc strengthening proved the point that it’s far harder to fight currency appreciation when it’s being driven by risk aversion rather than by speculation. More simply, fear can prove a stronger force than greed. My other reason for suggesting that the authorities should take a cautious approach is the experience of 2003/2004. Although we have no way of knowing how far the yen would have travelled if Japan’s MOF had not authorised intervention during that period, it is hard not to feel that in some ways their actions actually exacerbated the yen’s move.……………………………………………………………………………………….If Greece decided to leave the eurozone, is it good or bad for the euro?
Philippe Darwiche, ParisSD: Philippe, I think your question is a useful summation of many of those I received today.Before I answer it though, let’s consider whether it’s likely that any nation would leave the eurozone. In my opinion it isn’t if for no other reason than I simply don’t see how this can be achieved easily. While it is easy enough to see how a nation joins the single currency, I cannot imagine how it could exit in a co-ordinated fashion without causing extreme strains within the local economy. That said, it is clearly not totally impossible (just very unlikely).As evidence for this I would simply highlight the ECB working paper published last December discussing the legal position of a nation that decided to leave either the European Union or the eurozone. If it was impossible to leave the Eurozone then why bother publishing such a paper?Putting aside my scepticism about the likelihood of Greece leaving, let’s consider what would happen if it did. Firstly, it seems reasonable to say that if the Greek Drachma were to be reintroduced then it would likely lose around 30 per cent of its value against the euro in fairly short order (I’m basing my estimate on the yield gap that emerged between 2 year Greek and 2-year German government debt in early May at the height of the crisis). Given that outstanding Greek sovereign debt is denominated in euro’s this would have the immediate impact of increasing their debt burden by more than 30 per cent as well.On the assumption that Greece would only have left the euro in extreme economic circumstances anyway, it seems reasonable to suppose that it would look to restructure its debt at the same time, imposing haircuts of a similar magnitude on holders of its paper. Indeed, given that it would be unlikely to have access to the capital markets for a number of years afterwards and that it seems unlikely that the EU would be willing to provide any further aid then the haircuts would likely be larger. Given that a significant proportion of Greek sovereign debt is held within the European banking system this sounds like a very bad outcome for the eurozone and the euro. In other words, although it might seem a positive for the eurozone to be rid of nations that have struggled in the past to maintain budgetary discipline, it probably isn’t.If Greece were to leave then it would be presumably because it no longer saw any advantage from being within the eurozone (i.e. its borrowing costs now are higher than before it joined the single currency) and to regain some competitiveness for its tourist industry. The risk would therefore be that at least one other nation in a similar position might decide that this looked an attractive proposition. Again, its difficult to see such uncertainty as a positive.The important thing to stress here is that I think all this is extremely unlikely. By far the most probable outcome is that the euro survives (albeit with a revised treaty). Unfortunately, as a result I also find it very difficult to become a cheer leader for the euro given the structural problems that have been highlighted since the start of the year. Put more crudely, how can you feel positive about the euro when 2010 has proved that it still contains within its DNA the Greek Drachma, the Italian Lira and the Spanish Peseta?………………………………………………………………………………………."
492;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Yen surge puts investors on alert;Japan may intervene over currency;The yen’s surge to its highest level of the year against the dollar has put investors on alert for possible currency intervention by the Japanese authorities this week.If Japan acts to shield its stock markets and exporters from the rising yen, it will be the first time Tokyo has intervened in the foreign exchange markets since April 2004.Last week, the yen rose 2.5 per cent to a high of Y86.36 against the dollar, its strongest level since December.The dollar dropped as fears over the pace of the US economic recovery sent US Treasury yields to record lows and prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve would be forced into another round of “quantitative easing”.Concerns over the US economy also propelled the euro up through $1.30 against the dollar for the first time in two months.Traders said the yen’s break upwards through its December high could open the way for the currency to test the 14-year peak of Y84.80 it hit against the dollar last November.Once the yen had scaled that peak, they said, the way was open for the currency to test the record high of Y79.70 it hit against the dollar in 1995.Simon Derrick, head of currency strategy at BNY Mellon, said it was unlikely that the Japanese authorities would allow the situation to go that far, however.“I think if the dollar goes below Y85 against the yen, Japan will intervene,” he said.Mr Derrick noted that verbal intervention from officials had done little to stem the rise.Last week, Masaaki Shirakawa, governor of the Bank of Japan, said the appreciation of the yen hurt exports, while the associated stock price falls had a negative impact on capital expenditure and consumer spending.Mr Shirakawa said he was continuing to watch currency and stock price movements “carefully”.in spite of those warnings, the Nikkei 225 average of leading Japanese stocks dropped 2.9 per cent as the yen surged last Friday.“While I am sure the Japanese authorities understand that the yen’s strength is mostly related to dollar weakness, if they see the Nikkei down another 3 per cent, they will have to act,” said Mr Derrick.“The danger is that if the Y85 level breaks in dollar/yen, then speculators will quickly target record levels around Y80.”
493;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-16T21:44:20Z;European cheer trumps Bernanke uncertainty;;The mood in the markets turned increasingly bearish through this week as a series of worrying signals on the US economy reignited concerns about a “double-dip” recession and overwhelmed a promising start to the second-quarter earnings season.The dollar sank and US government bonds attracted fresh buying as an earnings-inspired rally for equities and commodities faded.The deterioration in confidence came as disappointing data on US retail sales and consumer confidence – plus very weak regional activity reports and further signs that inflation pressures remained tame – were accompanied by downbeat comments on the economy from the Federal Reserve.The minutes of the US central bank’s last policy meeting showed it had cut its forecast for 2010 growth and hinted at concerns that the threat of deflation might be rising.“The US economy is slowing and US interest rates are going nowhere fast,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon.“In fact, it might be inferred that some members of the Federal Open Market Committee appear to be leaning towards a further dose of quantitative easing in the months ahead.”Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said: “Despite all the policies aimed at supporting growth and employment, the [US] economy is at an inflection point and consumer sentiment is reacting as one would expect – with nervousness.“This is not to say it cannot be reversed, but right now consumers are clearly cautious and concerned and, unless something changes, it’s hard to envision a scenario where consumers part with their precious dollars.”A further worry for some in the markets came from signs that Chinese growth – long seen as the saviour of the global economy – was slowing. While year-on-year GDP growth eased relatively modestly in the second quarter from the first, a very weak report on June industrial production hinted at a more serious slowdown to come – which, coupled with soft inflation data, might give the authorities scope to loosen policy if required, analysts said.“The weak IP print likely reflects base effects, and slower inventory accumulation,” said Wensheng Peng at Barclays Capital. “Overall, the economy is heading in the expected direction . . . while policy flexibility will support growth if needed.”The growing uncertainty about the outlook for US growth and interest rates sent the dollar sliding on the currency markets. The greenback’s slide was exacerbated by improving confidence towards the euro as a series of peripheral eurozone debt auctions was met with strong demand. The single currency briefly rose above $1.30 for the first time since May.“Investors are gradually gaining a measure of confidence from the policy actions of individual eurozone governments,” said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit.“Nothing earth-shattering so far, but enough to raise hopes that policymakers have perhaps accepted the need to launch long-overdue fiscal and structural reforms. Spain is probably the best example.”Indeed, Stefano Di Domizio at Lombard Street Research noted that Spanish government bonds had been exceptionally strong recently. “Spain’s five-year yield spread to Germany has tightened a massive 70 basis points since early last week,” he said. “Spread tightening has been fuelled by trading volumes bouncing back from the exceptionally thin market in May and June.”The 10-year German Bund yield dipped 4bp over the week to 2.6 per cent.Meanwhile, the yield on the two-year US Treasury bond touched a record low of 0.58 per cent as the 10-year yield sank back below 3 per cent. By midday on Friday in New York, the benchmark yield was 13bp down on the week at 2.92 per cent.US and European equities saw their gains at the start of the week evaporate, as a strong start to the US quarterly earnings season, courtesy of Alcoa and Intel, gave way to less encouraging reports from Citigroup, Bank of America and General Electric.At midday in New York on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent over the week, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 retreated from a three-week high to end 0.7 per cent lower. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average also set a three-week high before closing 1.8 per cent lower.The CBOE Vix volatility index, a closely watched gauge of investor risk aversion, spiked about 12 per cent over the five-day period.Commodities also came under selling pressure as the week wore on. US crude oil, briefly above $78 a barrel at one stage this week, finished below $76. Copper, meanwhile, touched a 10-day low of $6,490 a tonne on Friday.But, in spite of the return of risk aversion, gold ended weaker at $1,191 an ounce, down from $1,198 at the start of the week.

496;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-07T13:58:25Z;BNY Mellon to become clearing member of IDCG;;Bank of New York Mellon said on Wednesday that it will become a clearing member of the International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), which is focused on interest rate swaps, the largest sector of the over-the-counter derivatives market.The move comes at a time when the battleground for clearing derivatives is heating up as the pending US financial reform bill mandates that standardised swaps, such as those for interest rates, be cleared by a central counterparty, or CCP, which is designed to lower systemic risk.“With the rapid changes occurring in the clearing and settlement process for derivatives, our clients want a capable, stable partner that has membership in clearing organizations like IDCG to support their growing and evolving trading needs,” said Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive officer of BNY Mellon Clearing.To date, IDCG has only shadow cleared swaps, and traders say it needs to attract support from established dealers in order to gain critical mass.Garry O’Connor, chief executive officer of IDCG, said: “The ascension of clearing members from the banking community is an important step forward for IDCG, and demonstrates the market’s broader movement towards our clearing solution.”IDCG is seeking to clear and settle swaps by converting them into economically equivalent futures contracts and has attracted the support of NewEdge and MF Global, two leading non-bank futures commission merchants or FCMs.IDCG is majority-owned by Nasdaq OMX and BNY Mellon holds a minority stake in the clearer.The main CCPs of interest rate derivatives are LCH.Clearnet, the CME, IDCG, Eurex in Germany and Brazil’s Bovespa.Seperately, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said on Wednesday that the cumulative gross notional value cleared by its credit default swap clearing houses surpassed $10,000bn during the week ending July 2.In the US, ICE said it had cleared $6,000bn of CDS indices (CDX) and $272bn in single-name CDS, resulting in open interest of $435 bn. ICE Clear Europe cleared €2,400bn in iTraxx indices and €379bn in single-name CDS, resulting in €371bn of open interest.
497;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-07-04T21:44:41Z;BNY Mellon eyes fresh acquisitions;;BNY Mellon, the US asset management and custody group, is to continue with its acquisition drive, focusing future dealmaking on Europe and Asia.Bob Kelly, the bank’s chief executive, said it was gearing up for expansion in South Korea and China, most likely through organic growth or joint ventures, adding: “We want to strengthen our position in France and Italy. We expect more opportunities in the next 12 to 24 months.”Mr Kelly was speaking as BNY Mellon completed a $2.3bn deal to acquire the securities processing business of Pittsburgh-based PNC. It also recently agreed the acquisition of BHF Asset Servicing, one of Germany’s biggest custodians, from BHF Bank and Sal Oppenheim.BNY Mellon, which prides itself on being the oldest and best-r༼ɏed bank in the US, with an Aa2 credit rating from Moody’s, raised $700m of fresh capital to back the acquisitions and would probably take a similar approach to future acquisitions.The group now has $21,000bn of assets under custody and its fund management operations, which operate under brands such as Dreyfus and Mellon, have $1,000bn under management. In the UK, it owns the Newton brand and has recently acquired the Insight franchise from Lloyds Banking Group, as the part-nationalised bank spins off non-core assets.Mr Kelly said he saw great scope to export Insight’s specialism in liability driven investment from the UK to the US. LDI involves adapting the management of pension assets to reflect the profile of a fund’s liabilities.Canada-born Mr Kelly was broadly supportive of international efforts to boost capital and liquidity via the prospective Basel III rule book. But he was damning about aspects of new US financial regulatory reform legislation – particularly US government intervention to cap interchange fees, which are the levies charged by card companies for processing transactions.Similarly, Mr Kelly said it was vital the government leaves the mortgage market – where it has historically played a central role in securitising lenders’ mortgage assets through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie and Freddie distort the market, he said.

499;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-06-29T14:34:39Z;The euro may be living on borrowed time;There may need to be a specific catalyst to spark currency markets to life;The steadier tone of the euro recently belies the darker story being told by price action in a range of underlying asset markets – suggesting the currency may be living on borrowed time, says Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He points out that Greek /German government yield spreads have continued to widen along the curve – with the 10-year gap poised to test its May peak – and notes the five-year credit default swap on Greek sovereign debt is now 80 basis points more expensive than equivalent insurance for Argentina.Mr Derrick says BNY Mellon data show outflows from Greek and Italian debt are still very much in evidence – in contrast to a return of net buying of the euro in recent weeks.“Although the currency markets have taken a relatively sanguine view of the euro over the past month, it is clear that sentiment towards the underlying asset markets continues to deteriorate at a rapid pace. This is an ominous sign.“As with most crises, there may need to be a specific catalyst to spark currency markets to life. As such, we note the German presidential election today – a vote increasingly seen as a vote of confidence in the government – while tomorrow sees both a Spanish government bond auction and the expiry of the European Central Bank’s €442bn in one-year loans to eurozone banks. All three events have the potential to significantly unsettle currency markets.”
500;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-06-27T14:27:47Z;Asian hedge fund hopes take a dive in 2010;;At the start of the year a wave of optimism was washing over the Asian hedge fund industry. Dozens of new funds were reported to be springing up in the region while global heavyweights – including Soros Fund Management – grabbed headlines as they opened offices in Hong Kong.Yet the forecast boom for the industry has not materialised and Asian hedge funds continue to suffer from an age-old problem: global investors do not want to give them money.“It’s frustrating for many of the managers out here that they can’t raise money at the moment,” says Andrew Gordon, head of alternative investment services in Asia for BNY Mellon.The lack of allocations to the region is in many ways surprising given that Asian economies have emerged as the beacons for growth in a world that is still reeling from the financial crisis.Asian financial markets are also developing more rapidly than those in the west and are packed with the kinds of pricing imperfections and dislocations that hedge funds are designed to exploit.Yet Asia-focused hedge funds (excluding Japan) have suffered a $1.4bn (£900m, €1.1bn) net outflow of capital since the start of the year according to the consultancy Eurekahedge, leaving the industry with about $103bn in assets at the end of May.By contrast, the $1,000bn North American industry has received $25bn of inflows over the same period.In many ways Asian hedge funds are suffering the same problems that have afflicted their European and American peers in the wake of the financial crisis, as investors have fled to liquid and transparent investments.But the Asian industry also has its own problems, analysts say, most notably poor performance in choppy markets.May was the worst month for global hedge fund performance since October 2008, and Asian funds fared particularly badly, losing about 4 per cent.Since the start of the year, funds focused on Asia excluding Japan are down about 2.5 per cent, while the American and European industries have registered gains, according to Eurekahedge.“The performance numbers that have come out for Asian hedge funds show there’s still a lot of beta,” says Kirby Daley, head of capital introductions in Asia for Newedge, the futures brokerage.Investors had already learnt during the financial crisis that Asian hedge funds mostly provided market returns, known as beta, rather than uncorrelated skill-based returns, or alpha.“There are no substantial moves in the Asian hedge fund industry to wean itself off beta,” says Mr Daley.“To get a sustainable Asian hedge fund industry we need to diversify the strategies out of beta-driven equity long-short into more of the volatility strategies, the macro strategies that can take advantage of market movements in both directions.”Yet while the industry as a whole appears to be struggling, beneath the surface there is an emerging split between the fortunes of large hedge funds and small ones.Big brand-name Asia-focused funds, many of them based in the US and Europe, are finding it much easier to attract investors than their smaller peers, according to prime brokers and fund managers.This is a trend that is going on across the world, catalysed in part by the increased focus on due diligence following Bernard Madoff’s $65bn fraud, but the effects appear to be exaggerated in Asia.Start-up Asian funds are “stuck”, says one Asian manager. “Basically they can’t raise money.”The funds of funds industry, which was a big source of capital for start-ups and early-stage managers before the financial crisis, has shrunk dramatically and remains stagnant.Big institutional investors are among the few players who are in a position to allocate new money to hedge funds, but they have strict rules about what they can and cannot invest in.In many cases they cannot invest in a hedge fund with less than $100m in assets or less than a three year track record.“That means that if you’re a $25m start-up, you’re kind of stuck because you’ve got no-one in the fund of fund space that’s giving you enough money to get to that $100m dollar hurdle,” says one industry source.Some of the biggest Asian institutional investors will only consider funds with at least $5bn under management, and most of these institutions prefer to invest in European and US hedge funds rather than on their home turf.As a result, bigger hedge funds are attracting more money but the start ups and the early stage managers are struggling.There are exceptions, of course. Senrigan, a Hong Kong-based event-driven hedge fund which launched in November 2009, got more than $100m in seed capital from Blackstone and has consequently been able to attract allocations from other investors.But if the Asian industry as a whole is to grow meaningfully and attract stable allocations of capital from investors, fund managers will need to prove they can provide returns that consistently outperform the market.As investors become more bold in their search for alpha, industry participants expect there will be a shift away from bigger funds and towards their smaller, more nimble peers.“Eventually investors will be looking for higher returns and for alpha returns you need smaller managers to get the kicker,” says Newedge’s Mr Daley.“There are definitely gems to be found.”
501;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-06-23T18:46:37Z;CDO charges fuel efforts to shed light on opaque markets;Regulators still unearth details highlighting opacity of sector;More than two years into the financial crisis, regulators are still unearthing details about practices that went on in the run-up to the financial crisis highlighting the opacity of the structured finance and securitisation markets.This week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the main US securities market regulator, filed charges against a manager of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), the complex debt securities based on pools of other assets. The charges relate to CDOs backed by mortgage-backed securities (MBS) managed by ICP Asset Management.Until the bursting of the US housing bubble brought activity in securitisation and structured finance to a dramatic halt, these parts of the capital markets were providing more than half the credit to US consumers and businesses, and a large amount in Europe too.Now, some securitisation sectors have recovered, such as those backed by car loans, but the overall volume of activity remains a fraction of the peaks reached in 2007.The CDOs on which investors, including some of the world’s biggest banks, lost the most money were backed by risky US mortgages sold to consumers with poor credit histories. Part of the SEC case revealed this week included allegations that such mortgage bonds were bought and sold at prices that allowed the CDO manager to lock in profits very quickly, at the expense of investors in the CDO. ICP’s founder said he would defend the allegations.In one example – which the SEC says is just one of “many dozens” – a CDO managed by ICP purchased about $22m of mortgage bonds from another client at a price of $75 per bond, even though ICP had purchased the same bonds for that same client earlier that day at only $63.50 per bond. In another, $9m worth of bonds were sold at a price of $99.22, just days after the same bonds had been purchased at $78.63.The case follows charges brought by the SEC against Goldman Sachs in April, accusing the bank of misleading investors in a CDO.That such trades could occur is partly a result of the opacity of the market, say some bankers.Structured finance is an over-the-counter market, which means that trades are done on a private basis. The market is dominated by the big Wall Street dealers, such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Barclays Capital. Before the crisis, the list included Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, which have since collapsed or been merged into other institutions.“The inherent problem is that all the big players know each other and are well-connected and are constantly communicating back and forth,” says Russ Parentela, a former Bear Stearns executive and now managing director at BNY Mellon, the financial services group, which is launching a trading platform for structured credit. “The big players have the most information, and if you are not super large, it is not easy to get information. It’s that lack of knowledge that has caused the unscrupulous behaviour.”Regulators round the world are now making efforts to lift the lid on structured finance. Indeed, investors in the sector are seeking it too, after their faith in credit ratings has been crushed on the back of dramatic downgrades and losses on securities once given the top triple A credit ratings.The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the SEC are all in the process of requiring much more information about the actual loans underpinning deals. In some cases, new rules have been introduced, and there are still many in the process of being written as the need for more information disclosure has become clear.Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC, has proposed a new regulatory framework for the securitised market to require disclosure of pool level or asset-level data for each loan. She says changes are “necessary and critical components of restoring investor confidence.”But debates centre round just how much information needs to be released about loans, and when, and also whether prices at which securities are traded need to be reported.“There are pushes for transparency throughout the pipeline that are going on,” says Richard Field, managing director of TYI, a consulting firm. “Price by itself tells you virtually nothing because the buyer or the seller could be the biggest fool. In order to have price transparency you need [loan level] transparency. Once you know what you own, you can independently value the security.”There has been a boom in valuation businesses in recent years. There have also been efforts to create trading platforms, with companies such as SecondMarket offering a place for buyers and sellers to come together. But so far none of these efforts has made much impact.Mr Parentela says it is still very expensive for investors to get information. Loan information can be bought from data providers, but then the raw data has to be “scrubbed” in order to be in the right format to analyse. Then, investors need a cash flow analytics system, which can be licensed. But the data feeds then also need to be incorporated and “mapped” on to the cash flow analysis system.“It’s not rocket science, but it’s a lot of work,” says Parentela. “It requires a lot of knowledge about how to do those mappings and scrubbings.”The overriding driver for BNY Mellon’s plans for a platform is to get the securitisation market back in large scale, he says, which would create further business for BNY Mellon custody and other businesses.The platform is seeking to provide both valuation and trading. “Either the market is going to get smaller or, if it’s truly going to get back to where it was, it’s going to have to be auditable,” says Mr Parentela. “Then, nobody could ever say you’re ripping off your customer.”
502;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-06-22T17:35:02Z;GFI buys stake in UK’s Kyte Group;;GFI Group, the inter-dealer broker, on Tuesday signalled its intention to take advantage of the regulatory push for more exchange trading and clearing of derivatives by buying a 70 per cent stake in Kyte Group, a London-based options trading firm, for over £38m ($56m).The move came the same day as BNY Mellon, an asset management and securities servicing company, highlighted the same trend by creating a new company to clear futures and derivatives, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, on behalf of institutional clients.BNY Mellon said it planned to become a clearing member on major exchanges and clearing houses “on a global basis to support the trading activities of its clients”.Gerald Hassell, president of BNY Mellon, said this was a “logical extension of our business model as the leading securities servicing provider in the world”.Legislation is being finalised in the US that would force as many standard OTC derivatives as possible be traded on exchanges and electronic “swap execution facilities”. There will also be a requirement to process OTC derivatives that are suitable for clearing at clearing houses.Many businesses with hitherto little interest in areas like OTC derivatives clearing are now pushing into these areas. GFI’s larger rival Icap, has taken the lead among inter-dealer brokers in building post-trade processing businesses in anticipation of the new regulations.Michael Gooch, GFI chief executive, said: “We believe the acquisition of Kyte and, in particular, its expertise in the listed derivatives markets and its proven risk management and clearing platforms, will position GFI well in an environment favouring standardised, exchange traded products.”Kyte, established in 1985, is a member of exchanges including NYSE Euronext, NYSE Liffe and Eurex, providing clearing, broking, settlement and back-office services to proprietary traders, brokers, market makers and hedge funds.Kyte’s customers use Kyte’s exchange memberships to trade exchange listed, traditional and alternative investment instruments including financial futures and options, cash stocks, cash bonds, warrants, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives.Ron Levi, GFI’s chief operating officer, told FT Trading Room: “There is no doubt that we see more products going onto exchanges and more products being cleared. Kyte has a lot of clearing expertise that we don’t have. We feel that more of our customers will require us to clear their business for them.”Kyte operates a clearing service for smaller players that cannot afford full clearing memberships of clearing houses, called Mini Prime.Kyte is a privately held company established in London in 1985 by David Kyte, a former floor trader on the London International Financial Futures Exchange, now known as NYSE Liffe.The Kyte group made a pre-tax profit of £11.7m as of its fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, on revenues of £115.4m. GFI said that it was expected to have pre-tax profit of £6-£7m for the latest fiscal year-end.GFI said the purchase price would be made up of £22.4m in cash and shares of GFI common stock with a value of about £15.9m. GFI would buy the remaining 30 per cent of Kyte in cash, at a price based on the performance of Kyte, in 2013.GFI shares were up 2.6 per cent, or 15 cents, to $5.93 at midday in New York.
503;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-06-22T16:36:02Z;Destabilisation fears back to haunt China;;Fears that speculative inflows of “hot money” could destabilise the Chinese economy have long preoccupied policymakers in Beijing. Now that the renminbi has been cut loose from its peg to the US dollar, these worries are back with a vengeance.The problem for policymakers is that most investors believe that the renminbi is significantly undervalued against the dollar – some even estimate by almost as much as 50 per cent. So speculating on a revaluation is widely seen as a one-way bet.That raises the prospect that speculative capital will flood into China, potentially crimping the central bank’s control over monetary policy and fuelling asset bubbles and inflation.This was certainly the case the last time China allowed the renminbi to appreciate between May 2005 and the reintroduction of its de facto peg to the dollar in July 2008.Speculative inflows surged during this period as investors bet on further renminbi appreciation. This saw China’s currency reserves rise by $1,100bn as it stemmed the renminbi’s rise, compared with an increase of just $500bn in the previous three years when the currency was pegged to the dollar.“In some ways that policy was a failure,” says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.“Currency reserves shot up, compounding China’s problem of how to diversify its assets. They will want to avoid that problem this time.”To deal with these concerns, the People’s Bank of China is seeking to promote the idea that the renminbi-dollar exchange rate will be unpredictable and swing in both directions. The message: speculators could get burned.“The PBoC is trying to make the point that there is two-way risk – this is not just a one-way bet,” said Robert Reilly, co-head of Asian fixed income and currencies at Société Générale.While the renminbi was allowed to rise 0.42 per cent against the dollar on Monday – the biggest move in 18 months – traders got a shock on Tuesday when it retreated 0.2 per cent.The talk in the market was that Chinese state-owned banks were aggressively driving down the price of the renminbi under orders from the central bank.“The greater flexibility – or two-way volatility between the renminbi and the dollar – will help mitigate hot money inflows,” said Jun Ma, China economist at Deutsche Bank.Mr Ma expects that there will be greater volatility in the exchange rate than there was between mid-2005 and July 2008, when the renminbi rose more than 20 per cent against the dollar.Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Chinese policymakers have been telling domestic banks that they must be on their guard to prevent clients from sending money in and out of the country to fund illicit speculation.Two weeks ago, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (Safe), which manages the country’s $2,400bn in foreign exchange reserves, summoned senior bankers to discuss the renminbi forwards market.Safe was concerned that investors have been exploiting pricing differentials between the domestic forwards market and the offshore non-deliverable forwards market.But the regulator stopped short of introducing controls on renminbi forward transactions – unlike South Korea, which imposed restrictions on forward transactions this month to reduce volatility in the won.One way that policymakers could have cut the risks of hot money inflows would have been to revalue the renminbi by a large amount in a single, unexpected move, catching speculators unawares.But economists reckon the chances of a big move are slim. The consensus expects a shallow, gradual appreciation.Three-month non-deliverable forwards currently imply a rise of just 0.77 per cent in the renminbi against the dollar, while one-year forwards suggest the market is expecting a rise of just 2.39 per cent.In the past, rising expectations for renminbi appreciation in the forwards market have tended to coincide with hot money inflows.Yet in spite of what looks like a one-way bet over the medium to long term, many economists believe that hot money flows will be limited.One reason given is that the annualised rate of appreciation is too slim to attract those investors who are unable to take on leverage.Economists reckon that speculators would need to expect annual appreciation of more than about 3 per cent per cent to make it worth their while to send money into China.Another big disincentive for hot money is that there are widespread fears that the Chinese economy is starting to cool and that the property market is about to crash.“Hot money inflows are not driven just by currency appreciation expectations, but also by expectations on asset prices,” said Qu Hongbin, HSBC’s head of Asian economics research.The Shanghai stock market has already tumbled more than 20 per cent this year, while housing sales are dropping sharply in many cities following a government clampdown on property speculation.In some respects, an increase in hot money inflows into China would provide a welcome boost to domestic liquidity, reckons Michael Kurtz, China strategist at Macquarie. “It may perversely help stabilise, or even lift, China’s sagging domestic real estate and equity markets,” he said.But while most observers have focused on the prospect of capital inflows into China, some analysts are more concerned about the risks being stacked in the other direction.A global double-dip recession or an unexpected slowdown in China, the thinking goes, could prompt Beijing to depreciate the renminbi.That would trigger severe outflows, economists say. And while inflows are relatively easy to manage through conventional policy tools such as open market operations or changes to the reserve requirement ratio, sudden outflows would be more problematic, Mr Kurtz said.
504;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-06-17T23:40:17Z;US banks seek co-investment rights;Compromises negotiated on financial reform legislation;"Banks could be permitted to invest in hedge funds alongside customers, in one of several compromises being negotiated to secure votes for financial reform, according to people familiar with talks in the US Congress.Such a change, which has been criticised by Carl Levin, a Democratic senator from Michigan, would allow an institution to make a small capital investment in a hedge fund or private equity firm to complement that of a client.The “Volcker rule”, which prevents banks from proprietary trading, also bars sponsorship and in­vestment in private pools of capital based on the argument that deposit-taking institutions should not be engaged in risky activity.But banks and some clients have told lawmakers that a minimal co-investment would provide “skin in the game” to help ensure that banks acted in the best interests of customers.No final decision has been made, but people involved said the exemption could be agreed to secure the support of Scott Brown, a Republican senator from Massachusetts, who voted in favour of a Senate reform bill last month.“For me it would be a bad mistake; it would move us in the wrong direction,” Mr Levin said on Thursday, but he declined to say whether the issue was a red line for him.Paul Volcker, who lent his name to the restrictions on banks’ relationships with hedge funds, said last week that the move would be a thin end of the wedge – heralding wider seepage between banks and private funds.Congress is in the last few days of a year-long reform effort, with a conference committee, chaired by Barney Frank, trying to merge the Senate bill with a House of Representatives version passed last year.Those crafting the final text have to find language acceptable to at least 60 senators before a vote within two weeks.On the sidelines to a rare public merger process, private talks are under way to find a response to the financial crisis that can be supported by diverse members of both parties.Mr Brown, whose victory in the election to fill the Senate seat of the late Edward Kennedy rocked the Democratic party, enjoys an unusual amount of clout for a freshman senator from the party out of power.Immediately after Mr Brown’s election Mr Obama announced the Volcker Rule in a marked toughening of his approach to Wall Street, widely believed at the time - though since denied by multiple administration officials - to be a response to the Massachussetts defeat.Mr Brown voted in favour of the Senate bill, along with a handful of Republicans, and is crucial to Democrats’ overcoming the final hurdle to getting legislation to President Barack Obama’s desk before July 4.State Street, the Massachusetts-based bank, has lobbied to be allowed the minimal co-investment, a change that would benefit other banks such as Bank of New York Mellon.Banks have argued that the proposed ban on investing in hedge funds would cost them a vital selling point with pension funds and other institutional clients. Without the ability to seed alternative-investment products, they say, they could lose clients to foreign asset managers that could still hold some “skin in the game.”“The proposed ‘Volcker rule’, while aimed at eliminating risky or speculative activity by banks, could negatively impact traditional bank asset management business,” a State Street spokeswoman said.Mr Frank has to satisfy Mr Brown and other moderates to ensure they support the final text. But he also has to satisfy Mr Levin, who wants a tough Volcker rule, Senator Blanche Lincoln, who wants a swaps spin-off rule that is hated by the banks, and Senator Susan Collins, who wants to force banks to adopt better quality capital.There is no straightforward path to the compromise that Mr Frank and Chris Dodd, the Senate banking committee chairman, are expected to deliver. But the tough ban demanded by Mr Levin, supplemented with a form of the derivatives and capital provisions desired by Ms Lincoln and Ms Collins, and a minimal co-investment desired by Mr Brown, is the latest attempt to achieve it."
505;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
506;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Plotting a course through volatility;;After another turbulent week in financial markets, the risk barometers are flashing red again.The centre of the storms are in the eurozone. But the problems of the 16-member monetary bloc further undermined sentiment this week around the world and across all asset classes.Key indicators in the equity, currency, government bond, commodity and interbank markets told the same story – the fear among investors is not abating.David Owen, chief European financial economist at Jefferies, says: “Investors remain fearful and uncertain. Whether it is rising eurozone government bond yields or the falling euro, uncertainty is hanging over the market.”Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, agrees: “The market indicators are pointing in the same direction. This is a very uncertain period, and no one quite knows how the world economy will come out of it.”In short, as jitters over sovereign credit risk have increased in Europe, so the measures of market stress, which flared during 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, are once more attracting notice from investors.This can be seen in indicators such as the Vix index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” and a measure of future volatility on the S&P 500, a basket of many of the world’s most liquid stocks.The Vix jumped 10 per cent and rose back above 30 on Friday after poor US non-farm payrolls data fuelled concern that the momentum of recovery in the US is slowing.Although it is nowhere near the highs seen in November 2008 when it hit 80, it crystallises the worries of many investors and highlights how the eurozone debt crisis is undermining sentiment elsewhere.Warning signs in the interbank lending markets are just as ominous, highlighting increasing concerns about the health of the banking sector.The rise of three-month dollar Libor, or the rate banks lend to each other, has doubled since mid-March, rising above 0.50 per cent.Meanwhile, the spread between “risk-free” overnight market rates and three-month dollar Libor has widened to more than 30 basis points from around 10bps a month ago. This is a sign that banks are less willing to lend to each other because of fears of counter-party risk – or that another lender will go under. Although this swap peaked at 364bp following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, its rise is alarming many investors.“It feels like the summer of 2007 again as we dust off some charts we first created during the early days of the crisis when interbank lending was just starting to freeze, as is the case today,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “The question of course is whether more strains are yet to come.”Some of these strains are reflected in credit default swaps, as Europe’s iTraxx crossover index of mainly junk-rated companies shows the cost to insure bonds against default rising remorselessly. The dollar index, which tracks the US currency against a basket of currencies, has also risen more than 10 per cent since the middle of March as investors seek the safety of the dollar. In commodities, copper is perhaps the best indicator of worries over the global economy. It is used in a variety of consumer goods, such as cars and fridges, making it a good gauge of economic activity. Its plunge of over 20 per cent since early April has prompted more worries over the feared double-dip recession.However, for the best assessment of strains in the markets, the eurozone is as good a gauge as any, with bond yields rising to record levels and the euro continuing to plummet.Italian and Spanish sovereign bond yield spreads over Germany on Friday widened to record levels since the launch of the eurozone 11 years ago and the euro itself fell to four-year lows.“The euro needs to fall to help European growth,” says Mr Owen. “But at the same time uncertainty over the future of the project has never been so high with worries that countries may fail to stick to fiscal austerity measures. The general refusal of investors to buy peripheral government bonds is also highlighting how dysfunctional the markets are.”It means the world is relying more heavily on a recovery in the US and China. But with the US facing record levels of public debt and concerns that the Chinese economy may be overheating, this offers little reassurance to many investors.Most strategists rule out the threat of a double-dip recession, but market indicators suggest the chances of such an outcome are rising.“The landscape continues to run parallel to the [autumn] of 2008 when market participants worried how the global economy and the markets attached to it would avoid being ‘shoved over the edge’ into the proverbial abyss,” warns John Stoltzfuz, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.
507;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-06-04T18:06:50Z;S&P in retreat after weak jobs report;;US stocks turned sharply lower on Friday after a disappointing jobs report reignited doubts about the strength of the economic recovery and put the market on track for losses over the week.US employment rose by 431,000 jobs last month, considerably fewer than the consensus economist estimate of 540,000.Census hiring added 411,000 temporary jobs to the payroll gain.“The unemployment numbers were abysmal,” said Andrew Neale, a partner at Fogel Neale Partners. “We are recommending our clients to be underweight equities and we have been for several weeks now, until we get some strength back in the underlying fundamentals.”However, the unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent was better than the 9.8 per cent estimate.The negative news on jobs, which came as a surprise, snapped two straight days of gains for US stocks in a week shortened by the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.By midday on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 2 per cent to 1,080.96, on course for a weekly decline of 0.8 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 2.1 per cent to 10,042.69, set for a weekly loss of 0.9 per cent.Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 1.8 per cent on the day to 2,262.36, which would make for a slight gain of 0.2 per cent on the week.Mr Neale said the stock market remained in “correction mode” and that he expected volatility ahead.Volatility “may be good for professional traders, but it is very unnerving for the small investors”.The Vix, a widely watched measure of market volatility, on Friday jumped 11 per cent to 32.69.Beyond assessments of the health of the US economy, ongoing concerns about Europe, most recently Hungary, also continued to weigh on sentiment during the week while efforts to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil spill remained in focus.Within the S&P 500, energy stocks seesawed during the week and on Friday were down 1.2 per cent, but they still were outperforming the wider market.Industrial and financial shares, which were lower by 3.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively, were being hit hard on the back of the jobs report.Among the laggards at midday were General Electric, down 3.9 per cent at $15.81, and JPMorgan, which had lost 1.9 per cent to $38.34. Caterpillar had lost 3.8 per cent to $58.80, helping to weigh on the Dow.Bank of New York Mellon was 3 per cent lower to $26.45 after it announced that it would offer $700m of common stock to help fund its purchase of a unit of PNC Financial Services.The world’s biggest custody bank agreed in February to pay $2.3bn for Pittsburgh-based PNC’s global investment-servicing business as BNY Mellon aimed to add more hedge fund and mutual fund clients.Shares in bailed-out insurer AIG lost 1.3 per cent to $34.74.Robert Benmosche, chief executive, is reported to have asked the board for time to consider options besides a public offering for spinning off AIA, its Asian unit.A deal to sell AIA to Prudential, a London-listed insurer, collapsed on Wednesday.US Steel dropped 5.9 per cent to $42.59 after the steel producer was removed from the Americas conviction buy list at Goldman Sachs.Rival AK Steel dropped 5.6 per cent to $13.67.US-listed shares in AngloGold Ashanti declined 1.4 per cent to $41.96 after the world’s third-largest gold producer said it had “fully closed” its Moab Khotsong mine in South Africa following a fatal accident on Wednesday.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts rose 12 per cent to $4.13 as the food chain lifted its earnings forecasts. It is projecting full-year operating profit of up to $15m.
508;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-27T14:50:05Z;China’s dilemma on the renminbi exchange rate;;"The recent improvement in US-Sino relations has been an important step towards an adjustment to the renminbi exchange rate – but China’s power brokers must decide if the time is right for the country to risk its export competitiveness, says Neil Mellor, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.“China’s commerce ministry, which has openly resisted any near-term shift, may now have the ear of senior officials,” he says. “The fact is that China’s exports are an integral component of a growth strategy to which renminbi stability has been an important contributor.”Mr Mellor notes growing doubts in the markets that an adjustment is on the cards, as renminbi forwards across the curve have unwound all their year-to-date gains since the start of this month.But he suggests the weight of recent evidence still points to some sort of adjustment as the first step towards addressing China’s spiralling reserve growth – which would also assist China in its fight against inflation.“China faces a hard choice; it can ignore adjustments to its currency regime by pointing to the potential damage to a key element of its economic recovery – risking US-Sino relations in the process – or it can deliver on a long-awaited policy initiative, whose introduction will never find an opportune time.“This is a dilemma that will not get any easier for the world’s third-largest economy.”"
509;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Khazanah offers S$1.2bn to control Parkway;;A subsidiary of Khazanah, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, on Thursday made a surprise S$1.18bn (US$840m) offer for a majority stake in a Singapore-based healthcare group, setting up a battle for control with India’s Fortis Healthcare.The offer for Parkway Holdings underlines the growing attraction of high-quality healthcare businesses in Asia. It comes after Fortis paid US$685m for a 25 per cent stake in Parkway in March from TPG, the US private equity group.Integrated Healthcare Holdings, the Khazanah subsidiary, said it was offering S$3.78 per share for enough shares to take its shareholding in Parkway from about 24 per cent to a maximum of 51.5 per cent.Ahmad Shahizam Mohd Shariff, director of Integrated Healthcare, said the offer gave Parkway shareholders an opportunity to realise the value of their holdings at a significant premium to the market price. The offer represents a 25 per cent premium to Parkway’s closing price of S$3.02 in Singapore on Wednesday.Mr Ahmad said Integrated Healthcare would consolidate Khazanah’s stakes in a number of Asian healthcare groups to create the region’s “premium regional healthcare platform”.Khazanah is understood to have given the go-ahead for the partial offer after failing to prevent Fortis from taking control of the board following its acquisition of TPG’s stake.A person with knowledge of the offer said that Integrated Healthcare’s strategy was to acquire sufficient shares to take control of the board, to which it would then appoint a significant proportion of independent directors.The bid would block Fortis’s attempts to add Parkway’s assets to its network of 62 hospitals in India. Parkway operates 16 hospitals with 3,400 beds in Singapore, Malaysia, India, China, Brunei and the United Arab Emirates.There was no immediate comment from Fortis on the possibility of a counter-bid that would allow it to retain management control of Parkway, which the Indian group has made plain was a key objective of its deal with TPG.Malvinder Mohan Singh, Fortis chairman, said in March that the acquisition of TPG’s shareholding “will significantly expand our footprint across the region and place us strategically for geographical and clinical leadership in Asia”.Fortis is in the process of raising R3.8bn (US$80m) from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, the island state’s main sovereign wealth fund. The fresh funds would help to finance a counter-bid.Integrated Healthcare is understood not to have reached prior agreement on the offer with minority shareholders, which include Bank of New York Mellon with 5.99 per cent, Newton Investment Management of the UK with 5.98 per cent and Franklin Resources of the US, also with 5.98 per cent.Integrated is being advised by CIMB Bank and Deutsche Bank.
510;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-26T10:21:27Z;Traders move to price in renminbi fall;;Traders wiped out the prospect of a near-term appreciation in the renminbi on Wednesday as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis continued to dominate direction on the world’s financial markets.In the forwards markets, traders have now moved to predicting a fall in the renminbi against the dollar.The Chinese authorities have effectively pegged the renminbi against the dollar since July 2008 in an attempt to protect its exporters from the effects of the financial crisis.This has caused friction with its trading partners, especially the US, that China has enjoyed an unfair trade advantage.Until recently, most analysts were predicting that Beijing would abandon the renminbi’s de facto peg against the dollar and allow its currency to appreciate, however.This was not just because of external pressure on Bejiing, which has maintained its abhorrence of outside interference on its currency policy, but also because it would help to alleviate rampant inflationary pressure in the Chinese economy.But the slide in the euro prompted by the eurozone’s debt problems has pushed the renminbi up to an eight-year high against the single currency, damaging Chinese exporters’ competitiveness.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said the recent slide in the euro might have persuaded the Chinese authorities that now was not the time for a change in currency policy.“That is what is behind the move in the forwards market,” he said. “Exporters are China’s main concern and the authorities are not going to put them in jeopardy.”In the one-month forwards market, the renminbi stood at Rmb6.8360 against the dollar, implying the renminbi would depreciate by 0.12 per cent against the US currency in one month’s time. This was the first time in five months that the one-month forward price has implied depreciation in the renminbi.Meanwhile, in the benchmark one-year forwards market, investors slashed the expectations of 12-month renminbi appreciation from 3 per cent to just 0.6 per cent.
511;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-20T14:32:15Z;The Australian dollar is on a boomerang trajectory;;The Australian dollar appears to be on a boomerang trajectory at the moment – and it is hard to see where a floor for the currency might emerge, says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He points out that the Aussie was one of the currency market’s stellar performers in 2009 with a “straight line” gain of 50 per cent against the US dollar from a February low.But its recent slide has left it near a nine-month trough versus its US counterpart, amid concerns about the outlook for commodity prices that will inevitably grow if China begins to arrest runaway growth in bank lending.Mr Mellor points out that recent selling of the Aussie has been underpinned by volumes. “BNY Mellon iFlow data show there have been consistent, albeit modest, outflows from Australian equities over the past few weeks – and a similar pattern of selling on the bond side.”He adds: “From a technical perspective, the immediate outlook for the currency is not favourable. It breached several key moving averages against the US dollar this week, and now has few obvious levels of support.“And if all these issues were not enough, there is a growing view that Australia may face a hung parliament in elections due later this year. Given that such uncertainty has been a prominent contributor to sterling’s woes, it must be assumed that the risk of further weakness for the Aussie is now significant indeed.”
512;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-17T18:24:37Z;Plan to reduce clearers’ repo risk;;The two big clearing banks in the US tri-party repurchase or “repo” market will no longer bear significant credit risk to dealers under proposals made by an industry taskforce and endorsed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.In tri-party repo, a clearing bank such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon acts as an agent between a bank borrowing money and pledging its assets as collateral to the temporary lender of cash.During the financial crisis of 2008, money market funds and other investors pulled repo funding from Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and other banks and ultimately forced the Federal Reserve to introduce temporary funding mechanisms for banks.But one significant concern revealed during the financial crisis was the way clearing banks took on credit risk to a dealer during the day.The clearing banks unwind all repo trades in the morning and then, after dealers have bought and sold securities during the day, helped by intra-day credit from the clearers, repo trades are re-set for the next day.In the event of a dealer’s running into trouble during the day, the concern among regulators is that the clearing bank is left heavily exposed and could itself be impaired, creating a systemic crisis for the market.The New York Fed yesterday published a white paper on the proposed reforms made by the Tri-party Repurchase Agreement Infrastructure Reform Task Force. Reforms include ending the daily unwind of repos, which the taskforce argues will help reduce intra-day credit in the system by 90 per cent.“It’s an aggressive target but we think we can get there,” said Mark Trivedi, chief operating officer for clearance and collateral management at JPMorgan.Standards for margining and risk management will also be strengthened but the industry has already stopped using lower quality assets as collateral for repo.At its peak, the tri-party repo market financed some $2,800bn in securities but, during the first quarter of 2010, the market averaged $1,700bn.The New York Federal Reserve said the industry needed to work on addressing the risk that the failure of a dealer sparked a “fire-sale” of securities, disrupting the broad market.“The recommendations will not materially alter the propensity of cash investors to run from a troubled dealer,” said the New York Fed in its white paper.“In fact, they may withdraw funding from a troubled counterparty sooner because of increased awareness of the risk of having to accept collateral in lieu of cash in the event of a default.”The New York Fed has asked for public comment on the proposals over the next 30 days.
513;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-17T03:18:35Z;US funds on trail of foreign acquisitions;;A year ago, asset managers were mired in gloom. The markets were at all-time lows and revenues were plummeting.It could not be more different now. Asset managers are riding high on renewed investor confidence with rallying markets lifting first-quarter revenues and profits to record levels.But where renewed buoyancy has spurred US fund managers such as Legg Mason to turn acquisitive eyes overseas to less mature markets, Europe’s fund managers are more cautious about the cost of deals.Aberdeen Asset Management, headquartered in Scotland, has doubled funds in a year to $171bn largely through acquisitions. But it has shelved plans for further purchases, including in the US, as the price of targets has risen.Martin Gilbert, chief executive, last week said he would focus instead on expanding distribution of existing funds.In an ideal world, acquisitions are the fastest way to grow, says Kevin Pakenham, managing director at Jeffries International. But success is finely balanced on price and whether acquirers tie in revenue-generating staff.M&A in the industry is littered with expensive failures of integration, notes Michael Dobson, Schroders’ chief executive.But that is not deterring US predators. Their home market may be the world’s biggest single savings market but it is comparatively expensive and dominated by businesses such as Fidelity, Invesco and Vanguard selling funds in high volumes at low fees.Ron Dewhurst, international head at Legg Mason, says the US “has peaked in terms of its share of global equity markets. Being a predominantly US-focused business, our view is that the rate of growth is going to be greater outside the US than within it”.A third of the company’s $685bn assets are currently outside the US. In 10 years, Bank of New York Mellon’s assets outside the US have risen from $300m to $400bn – about half of its total funds under management. Jonathan Little, BNY Mellon’s acting co-head of asset management, says: “We continue to look at expanding. The prospects outside the US are exciting.”BNY Mellon is more focused on Asia. But other US groups are keen to exploit opportunities thrown up in Europe by converging trends towards a single market amid regulatory pressure for greater disclosure on advice and fees.Banks are struggling to create cultures attractive to individuals skilled in turning in high returns and are focusing more on distributing funds, says Denis Bastin, principal at consultants Bastin Advisory.In the wake of the financial crisis, several banks that historically dominated fund distribution in Europe are also being forced to look at disposals in return for state aid.Many will struggle to find buyers. UniCredit, the Italian bank, said this week it was exploring “all strategic options” for Pioneer, its asset management arm, but added that a disposal was not an option in the current market.But would-be buyers, including private equity groups such as Advent International, are emerging from the US. Some are bent on consolidation, following in the footsteps of BlackRock that last year bought Barclays Global Investors and became the world’s biggest manager with more than $3,000bn in funds.Consolidators aim to build global brands by buying low-cost businesses where individual managers’ skills are less important than systems. But success rests on buying assets cheaply, cutting costs and expanding margins.Other buyers are less sensitive to price. So-called “multi-boutiques”, such as BNY Mellon and Affiliated Managers Group, offer autonomy and revenue shares to managers charging premiums for performance. These multi-boutiques have been steadily picking off rivals in recent years.AMG, managing more than $230bn, last year bought majority stakes in Artemis, the retail manager with about £10bn ($14.5bn) in funds, and in Pantheon Ventures, the UK-based private-equity fund of funds.In spite of rising prices, more deals are on the way, say advisers. As Mr Dewhurst notes: “High-quality asset management businesses tend to transact in good markets. You pay a good price for a good quality business.”
514;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-16T14:45:11Z;Kovacevich hits out at Tarp;;The decision by US regulators to force the nation’s nine largest banks to accept $125bn in taxpayer funds during the financial crisis of 2008 did not restore confidence in the banking system, but undermined it, Richard Kovacevich, former chief executive of Wells Fargo, has said.At a time when the US Treasury is touting an expected repayment, at a profit, of $245bn from the troubled asset relief programme, Mr Kovacevich disputes conventional wisdom that the bail-out was a success. “People are high-fiving each other and bragging about restoring health to the banks”, Mr Kovacevich told the Financial Times, adding: “Baloney.”In his first public comments on the matter, Mr Kovacevich said the decision in 2008 to force the nation’s biggest banks, including his own, to accept Tarp funds eroded confidence in the system.The former Wells Fargo chief, who stepped down as chairman at the end of 2009, agrees in principle with the notion of government extending temporary help to some banks but said the programme forced on him and other banks exacerbated the industry’s problems because it did not distinguish between healthy banks and troubled ones.At a hastily called meeting in Washington DC on October 13 2008, then-Treasury secretary Hank Paulson told the heads of nine top banks that they needed to accept government funds.Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo all received $25bn. Bank of America received $15bn, and $10bn was reserved for Merrill Lynch, which had agreed to be acquired by BofA. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley each received $10bn, and Bank of New York/Mellon and State Street received $5bn between them. Mr Kovacevich objected to the programme at the time, saying investors would conclude every bank receiving bail-out funds was in trouble.Mr Kovacevich told the FT that this was borne out by the share price of Wells Fargo and other banks falling almost 80 per cent from the time the programme was announced until early March 2009. Wells Fargo’s stock dropped from $33 per share to $7.80 but has since come back.“Do you know how many innocent shareholders of ours sold at these bottoms?” said Mr Kovacevich. “These are people who are retired, owned Wells Fargo stock for 40 years and depended on it for dividends. “Thousands and thousands of people sold. And who made money? The shorts on the way down, who then went long because they knew it was oversold. Who lost? The retail investor who doesn’t understand how this worked. That’s the calamity of this thing.”
515;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-11T21:09:09Z;Wall St pares losses to end slightly lower;;"US stocks gave back a portion of Monday’s spectacular gains on their open on Tuesday but the session closed with the main indices well off the day’s lows and just slightly lower on the day.As investors digest the implications of the weekend’s EU relief package, it is evident that problems remain, said Dan Alpert, managing partner at Westwood Capital, a boutique investment bank.“People are realising there is no free lunch. The deal only postpones the resolution of the underlying problems”Looking forward to Friday’s retail sales data, Mr Alpert said: “We’re seeing confidence induced spending. Unless that’s underpinned by income growth, it’s not sustainable.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent at 1,155.79, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 10,748.26 and the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,375.31.Healthcare, a traditionally defensive sector, rallied. WellPoint was up 1.9 per cent to $52.11, Cigna rose 1.5 per cent to $33.13 and Aetna advanced 0.5 per cent to $29.61.Goldman Sachs lost 1.3 per cent to $141.97 and JPMorgan fell 1 per cent to $41.55 as the banks reported that their trading operations made money every single business day in the first quarter of the year.Goldman’s trading desk reported profit of at least $25m on each of the quarter’s 63 working days, according to a regulatory filing.US-listed shares in Toyota were 0.9 per cent higher at $77.46 as the world’s largest carmaker forecast a 48 per cent rise in profit this year even as it struggled with recalls in North America.Toyota issued relatively modest projections for earnings growth this year, seen by many analysts as an acknowledgement of the continuing legal risks and of the likelihood that its sales margins would remain under pressure.BP, Transocean and Halliburton were in focus as their top executives appeared before Congress to explain the circumstances behind the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.US-listed shares in BP, which owns the rig, were flat to $48.74.Transocean, which ran the rig, rose 3.8 per cent to $68.86 and Halliburton, which poured cement casings around the well, rose 2.7 per cent to $28.34.Bank of New York Mellon declined 1.9 per cent to $30.98 on news that Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney-general, is suing the bank’s Ivy Asset Management unit for “deliberately misleading clients” about investments tied to Bernie Madoff, a convicted Ponzi scheme operator.The suit alleges that Ivy’s due diligence uncovered irregularities in Mr Madoff’s investment firm but continued to invest client money into his funds.Worries about tightening policies in China continued to weigh on materials stocks. The sector was
one of the session’s worst performers.Cliffs Natural Resources, a mining company focusing on iron ore, pulled back 7.2 per cent to $56.79 and AlcoaMBIA, a leading bond issuer, lost 6.2 per cent to $8.75 as it reported a first-quarter loss of $7.22 per share compared with profit of $3.34 per share a year earlier. It was largely the result of an accounting rule that required the company to revalue some of its obligations.Global asset manager Legg Mason was up 11.5 per cent to $33.38 as the stock was raised to “neutral” from “underperform” at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The broker cited the company’s plans to restructure and buy back $1bn in shares after it suffered some of the biggest losses among publicly traded asset managers during the credit crisis.A number of technology stocks continued their rally. Apple led the group, rising 1 per cent to $256.52. Dell was 0.7 per cent higher to $15.48 and IBM gained 0.5 per cent to $126.89.Dairy company Dean Foods moved 8.5 per cent lower to $9.58 as the stock was downgraded by atleast two brokers following disappointing first-quarter results. UBS cut the stock to “neutral” from “buy” and Sanford C. Bernstein lowered it to “market perform” from “outperform”."
516;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-11T18:56:37Z;BoNY Mellon unit charged with fraud;;The New York attorney-general’s office has charged a Bank of New York Mellon subsidiary with fraud, saying it deliberately misled clients about investments tied to Bernard Madoff to protect its fee income.The 50-page civil complaint filed on Tuesday alleges that Ivy Asset Management and two former senior officers concluded in 1998 that client money should not be put with Mr Madoff because he had lied to them and was not investing funds as advertised.But, the complaint says, Ivy did not inform clients who already had money with Mr Madoff of its suspicions for fear of alienating them and losing their fee income. Ivy reaped $40m in fees from clients with large Madoff investments between 1998 and 2008, the complaint says.Ten years later, Mr Madoff confessed to running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. Ivy clients, including a dozen New York union pension funds, lost $227m, according to the complaint.“Ivy and its former co-principals saw the trouble with Madoff coming around the bend, but instead of guiding their clients through the financial waters, they sold them down the river,” said Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney-general.“They shamelessly profited off of their own clients’ impending misfortune and we are holding them accountable for their actions.”Ivy said in a statement: “We intend to defend ourselves against these claims.” It added that most of the investors concerned were professionals who made their own investment decisions.BNY Mellon bought the manager in 2000 and is believed to be winding it down. It said it was “disappointed” that Mr Cuomo had filed the complaint, which involved “a legacy business”.At its peak, Ivy had $15bn under management but that has dropped to $5bnHoward Wohl and Larry Simon, the former officers named in the complaint, left Ivy in 2008.Mr Simon’s lawyer called the lawsuit an “unwarranted attack on his integrity” and said his client “had warned Ivy’s investors to reduce their exposure to Madoff for 10 years”.A spokesperson for Mr Wohl said he “intends to vigorously defend himself against these unwarranted charges”.In 1999 Mr Wohl allegedly recommended to Mr Simon that they remove all Ivy money from Mr Madoff, then about 3 per cent of the assets. “This doesn’t justify any investment, let alone 3 per cent,” he wrote, according to the complaint.Ivy then took most of its own money out and began warning new clients against Mr Madoff, the complaint states, but the message to clients who already had Madoff investments was different. Ivy suggested they reduce their exposure, but wrote: “We have no reason to believe there is anything improper.”
517;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-11T17:15:35Z;A currency not just single but unloved;Status as reserve currency under threat;In spite of the rescue package announced at the weekend, the euro’s status as a reserve currency is under threat.Sentiment towards the single currency has already soured after the initial boost provided by the €750bn ($950bn) emergency funding facility agreed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.For some investors, given continuing uncertainty in the eurozone, the main question is how much further the currency can fall.For much of the past decade, the story of the euro has been one of rising credibility, entrenching it as the most popular reserve currency after the dollar.But analysts say the euro’s recent break below $1.30 against the dollar is likely to exacerbate worries over its status.Diversification of global reserve holdings has been a source of support for the euro in recent years as central banks have sought to adjust their portfolios away from the dollar.Although the composition of China’s $2,450bn of foreign exchange reserves is a state secret, it is believed that 20-25 per cent is held in euros, compared with 60-65 per cent in dollars.Figures from the IMF show that, for reserve managers outside China, the allocation of euros in reserves rose from $97bn in the first quarter of 2002 to $672bn in the fourth quarter of 2009. The latter figure was out of total stockpiles of $2,180bn.Simon Derrick of Bank of New York Mellon says that, by comparing the reserve growth in the IMF data with the movement of the euro against the dollar, it can be estimated that reserve managers paid an average of $1.2877 for their euro holdings.“It is clear that, with the break of $1.30, we are entering some particularly sensitive territory for many long-term investors,” he says.At the very least, reserve managers will be cautious about adding new euro holdings to their portfolios, Mr Derrick says.“The events of the past few months are leading to a wholesale, and warranted, re-evaluation of what the euro actually represents. It is not just the new Deutschemark, but also the new Greek drachma and Spanish peseta.”There is no doubt that the euro is unloved. Even before this week’s bail-out, short-term speculators had record short positions in the currency.Positioning data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is often used as a proxy for hedge fund activity, showed speculators had increased their bets against the single currency to a record $16.8bn in the week to May 4.Those bets were likely to have been extended during the sharp sell-off in the euro that saw it hit a 14-month low of $1.2520 against the dollar last Thursday, taking its losses since the start of the year above 12 per cent.It was an unwinding of those positions that saw the euro rally on Monday when the package was announced, with the single currency trading to a high of $1.3093 against the dollar.But the euro quickly came under selling pressure on Monday as the short covering flows from leveraged investors evaporated. It fell further to $1.2689 against the dollar on Tuesday.Analysts say that with the short-term speculators now sidelined, it is the actions of longer-term investors that will dictate the direction of the single currency.“The rescue package has given rise to serious longer-term concerns for the euro, which could make reserve managers more reluctant to buy the single currency,” says Beat Siegenthaler at UBS.He says sovereign reserve managers have been less than impressed by the crisis-management capabilities of eurozone institutions during the past few months.“Even though in the end the EU did manage to come up with an impressive response, it may not have been enough to appease the concerns of many longer-term sovereign investors,” Mr Siegenthaler says.Ian Stannard at BNP Paribas says the euro could fall as low as parity against the dollar by the first quarter of 2011 as long-term investors abandon the eurozone as the currency’s reserve status comes into question.“European bond markets are no longer a homogenous entity, which has reduced their attractiveness to foreign investors,” he says.Mr Stannard says that during the past year the net inflow into European sovereign debt markets has collapsed, with central banks and sovereign wealth funds, which had been steady euro buyers and bond investors for years, disappearing.Europe’s politicians, such as Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, suggested that the aim of the rescue package was to stop the “speculative attack” on the euro.Analysts say the measures are aimed at stabilising government bond spreads in the eurozone and providing stable funding conditions for countries and banks in the region.They say a weak euro will suit the eurozone’s political leaders because it should increase exports and help countries tackle their substantial budget deficits and rising debts.The challenge comes from the European Central Bank’s announcement of plans to buy eurozone sovereign debt, a U-turn from its position just last week. One reason the euro had performed relatively well until this year was the fact that the ECB had refused to follow the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England down the path of quantitative easing.The ECB has steadfastly refused to admit that its bond purchases amount to QE, saying its purchases will be sterilised by issuing short-term bills, so there will be no increase in the money supply.But analysts say that, even if the ECB is to be believed on sterilisation, the reintroduction of its long-term financing operations, also announced during the weekend, to provide new fixed-rate loans to banks will in effect ease eurozone monetary policy.“Finance ministers in the eurozone might argue that they acted to save the euro, but in reality they acted to save national bond markets – and the euro is the fall guy,” says Steve Barrow at Standard Bank.He that says if they had wanted to “save” the euro, they would have tightened monetary conditions, but these have in fact been loosened .“This leads to the scary thought that if there was not a euro crisis before the weekend bail-out plan, there is now.”
518;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-05-02T08:12:27Z;Convergence happening in US;;Convergence between traditional asset management and the hedge fund industry is proceeding slowly in the US, as investors are reluctant to accept managers moving out of their own field.Just over half of hedge fund managers and less than half of traditional long-only managers in the US have taken actions to move into the other space, according to a report from BNY Mellon and Greenwich Consultants.Even so, many managers do not see this as convergence.“Most hedge funds see changes they are making to their products and policies not as part of an attempt to ‘converge’ but rather as a natural progression of their own business and investment models,” the report said.Convergence is visible in a growing trend for hedge funds to abandon some of their traditional opacity and provide greater transparency to investors, according to the report, while it also finds a number of managers, both traditional and alternative, launching crossover products in the other domain.Investors, however, are reluctant to use crossover products. More than half (57 per cent) of investors surveyed said they would not be interested in using a hedge fund manager for a traditional investment strategy, while more than 60 per cent refused to consider traditional managers for hedge fund strategies.New regulation could accelerate the convergence trend, but views on this differ.While 45 per cent of investors think this will happen, just a third of hedge funds and slightly less than a third of regulated managers agree.
519;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-04-30T17:08:53Z;Euro rises after week of turmoil;;The euro dropped to a one-year low against the dollar this week as worries over the fiscal problems in heavily indebted Greece and other countries on the periphery of the eurozone escalated.The single currency was under pressure early in the week as fears mounted that a joint rescue package for Greece from its eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund would not be large enough, or come soon enough, to shore up its finances.But the euro plunged on Tuesday after rating agency Standard & Poor’s slashed Greek government debt to junk and downgraded Portugal. The euro was hit by another wave of selling on Wednesday after S&P cut Spain’s rating. The single currency dropped to a 12-month low of $1.3112 against the dollar as the yields on Greek, Portuguese and Spanish government debt surged to record levels.The euro recovered some poise later in the week on reports that a rescue package for Greece had been agreed between its leaders and representatives from the European Union and the IMF and was to be unveiled in the next few days.Reports suggested that Athens had agreed to target a €24bn ($32bn) reduction in its budget deficit over three years. In exchange, Athens would receive funding of €100bn-€120bn, from the IMF and Greece’s eurozone partners.The euro recovered to stand down 0.3 per cent at $1.3307 against the dollar on the week. The single currency also recovered from a three-month low against the pound to stand 0.2 per cent higher at £0.8711 against the pound on the week and eased 0.3 per cent to Y125.15 against the yen.Not all analysts were convinced that the euro’s rebound was sustainable. Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said that the reaction of the Greek public to austerity measures agreed by its government had received little attention in the market. He said opinion polls showed a majority of the Greek public disapproved that the IMF and the EU had been asked for aid in the first place, and two thirds thought the current situation could lead to social unrest.“We suspect the reaction to new measures when they are announced will be negative,” said Mr Mellor. “This story may not yet have run its course. We still see this as a continuing negative for the euro.”Meanwhile, the dollar and the yen benefited at the start of the week as worries over Greece spilled over into the wider market, sending global equities sharply lower and driving haven demand for the US and Japanese currencies.But investor confidence rebounded on hopes of a Greek rescue package, combined with strong corporate earnings and a pledge from the Federal Reserve to keep US interest rates at ultra-low levels for an extended period. This saw the dollar and yen give back some of their gains.Over the week, the dollar rose 0.7 per cent to $1.5273 against the pound and climbed 0.2 per cent to SFr1.0771 against the Swiss franc. The dollar was little changed at Y93.99 against the yen on the week.The Australian dollar rose 0.5 per cent to $0.9300 against the US dollar over the week after stronger than expected consumer price inflation data boosted expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia would raise interest rates further at its policy meeting this month.
520;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-04-20T21:04:07Z;Wall St boosted by healthy bank earnings;;"US stock prices rallied for the second session on Tuesday, helped by gains in the highly weighted financials sector and some strong earnings announcements that boosted the bulls.“Today, it’s a welcome back, risk-recovery trade day around the globe supported by positive earnings surprises from global brand names in diverse sectors in Europe and the US – as well as an improvement in German investor sentiment for the first time in seven months,” said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities.He added: “This week belongs to earnings season with the economic data points back-end loaded for Friday and giving full focus on earnings as 135 companies in the S&P 500 report.”After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,207.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 11,117.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,500.31.Goldman Sachs, in the spotlight after regulators filed fraud charges against the bank on Friday, fell 2.1 per cent to $159.98 in spite of reporting significantly better-than-expected quarterly results, boosted by record fixed-income trading.Net profit increased 91 per cent to $3.46bn, or $5.59 per share, in the quarter, from $1.81bn, or $3.39 per share, a year earlier. The average analyst estimate was $4.14 per share.AIG, the troubled insurer that lost $2bn insuring collateralised debt obligations, including $6bn worth of Goldman’s, is considering pursuing Goldman to recoup some of those losses.The rest of the financials sector was higher as investors appeared to shrug off worries that the action against the bank would impact the wider sector.JPMorgan rose 1.1 per to $45.88 and Bank of America climbed 1.2 per cent to $18.61.Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $4.97 as the bank’s target price was raised at UBS to $5 from $3.75.IBM, the world’s largest technology services provider, lost 1.9 per cent to $129.69 in spite of the company raising its full-year earnings guidance and reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, boosted by an 18 per cent rise in consulting-
services signings.First-quarter profit was $1.97 per share from $1.70 per share a year earlier, compared with average analyst expectations of $1.93 per share.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, shed 0.1 per cent to $63.19 after it said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 9.5 per cent to 48.18 cents per share.Delta Air Lines dropped 0.2 per cent to $13.16 after the airline reported mixed first-quarter results with lower-than-expected revenues but a drop in losses from previous quarters.The largest carrier by passenger numbers lost $256m, or $0.31 per share, in the quarter to March, compared with a $794m, or $0.96, loss in the same period the previous year.Revenues climbed 2.5 per cent to $6.85bn, helped by rising fares, more bag-checking and fuller planes, but fell short of analyst forecasts of $7bn.Coca-Cola lost 1.5 per cent to $54.47 as the soft drinks company reported quarterly results that missed average analyst estimates, hurt by a decline in North American sales volumes. Revenues in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to $7.53bn, but fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $7.72bn.Health insurer UnitedHealth Group lost 0.8 per cent to $30.98 even after the company posted first-quarter earnings that rose 21 per cent on the same period a year ago, beating analyst estimates. The company said rising Medicare enrolment offset losses in private-sector plans.Regional lenders were also in focus. US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon both beat earnings expectations. US Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $28.21, while BNY Mellon, was up slightly to $32.15.PNC Financial, which sold a unit earlier this year to BNY, was up 2.2 per cent to $64.92.But regional depository banks were some of the biggest fallers of the session after lacklustre earnings reports from two companies. State Street fell 4.2 per cent to $45.28 after it said earnings in the first quarter were in line with expectations but revenues disappointed.Smaller rival Northern Trust lost 5.1 per cent to $55.37. Earnings per share were 64 cents, compared to average analyst estimates of 71 cents per share.Motorbike maker Harley-Davidson was one of the top risers in the S&P 500 index as the company jumped 7.3 per cent to $35.17 after posting better-than-expected first-quarter results."
521;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-04-20T20:55:10Z;Regional lenders’ earnings add to optimism;;Two large US regional banks reported strong first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, continuing the drumbeat of upbeat economic news from the financial sector.Bank of New York Mellon reported first-quarter earnings of $601m, or 49 cents a share, compared with $363m, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier.The bank, which provides financial services to money managers, corporations and wealthy individuals, said total assets under custody and administration in the period rose to $22,400bn, up 15 per cent from the prior year, but flat compared with December 2009.Provisions for credit losses decreased to $35m in the quarter, compared with $65m in the fourth quarter of 2009. Non-performing assets totalled $459m, down $91m, or 17 per cent, compared with the prior period.“The economic outlook is clearly improving as demonstrated by the performance of the equity and credit markets,” said Robert Kelly, chief executive.BNY Mellon put aside $164m, or 10 cents a share, in the quarter to cover litigation and other expenses related to restructuring and merger integration costs. The bank bought PNC Financial Services Group in February.Minneapolis-based US Bancorp’s first-quarter earnings jumped 27 per cent to $669m, or 34 cents a share, compared with $529m, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier, as lending picked up and provisions for bad loans decreased.The bank wrote $36.5bn of new loans in the period, including $13.3bn of mortgage products and $6.6bn of commercial real estate commitments. Provisions for bad loans fell for the second consecutive quarter to their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008.Early and late stage delinquencies as a percentage of ending loan balances also dropped in all major loan categories. The bank said it expected the level of charge-offs to remain stable in the second quarter.Richard Davis, US Bancorp’s chief executive, said the bank would like to raise its dividend, but will not take action until there is more evidence of a “sustainable economic recovery” and it gets more guidance from regulators on new capital requirements.Unlike their big Wall Street counterparts, which have large trading operations to offset a downturn in traditional lending and borrowing, regional banks have been among the hardest hit by the credit crisis.Although many of these banks started to turn the corner late last year, some are still mired in souring loans, especially from commercial real estate.Regions Financial Corp, for instance, reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss of $255m, or 21 cents a share, but still saw loan loss provisions grow in the first quarter to $770m, down from December, but up 81 per cent compared with a year ago. The loss compares with a profit of $26m, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier.
522;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-04-19T22:11:32Z;Overview: Threat of tougher bank rules dents sentiment;Haven demand lifts dollar and yen;The prospect of tougher regulation on the financial sector in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s fraud charges against Goldman Sachs continued to be felt across global markets on Monday, prompting a broad reduction in risk exposure.The mood of unease among investors was heightened by fresh concerns about Greece, moves by China to tighten policy and the impact of the volcanic ash cloud drifting over Europe.But there was no repeat of Friday’s sharp sell-off in US and European equity markets as the global recovery story was boosted by positive earnings from Citigroup and some robust US economic data.The Conference Board’s index of leading indicators, a gauge of the likely performance of the US economy over the next three-to-six months, rose 1.4 per cent in February, its twelfth successive advance.“This is not only the strongest report since the Lehman crisis, but it is also the strongest report of the last quarter century,” said Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon.“With the major indicators pointed strongly higher, the recovery appears more broad-based than the market currently anticipates.”By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent at 1,197, following a 1.6 per cent slide at the end of last week, and sentiment became more relaxed – as highlighted by a 5 per cent drop in the Vix volatility index. The Vix – closely-watched as a gauge of risk-aversion – had leapt 15 per cent on Friday.“Although the SEC fraud case does not have direct implications outside financials, the rise in uncertainty is negative for equities at a time when equity markets are overbought,” said JPMorgan.“Technicals have been pointing to overbought equity markets for some time now and [Friday’s] correction has the potential to drag the S&P500 down towards 1,175 in the near term. But our technical strategists see very few chances of the S&P 500 falling below 1,150, the January high, over the coming weeks.”In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.7 per cent, with airlines badly hit as the travel chaos caused by volcanic ash continued.But Royal Bank of Scotland suggested a temporary volcanic eruption should have virtually no impact on economic activity in Europe in the long run.“Overall, we believe that the economic cost of the disruptions would amount to 0.1 per cent of GDP maximum, should airline activity completely recover by the end of the week.”Meanwhile, the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo fell 1.7 per cent, its biggest one-day fall in two months, while the Shanghai Composite index tumbled 4.8 per cent – its worst day for eight months – after the Chinese government ordered banks to crack down on property speculation in a bid to cool the booming real estate market.Worries that such moves could have an impact on Chinese growth triggered a wave of haven buying of the dollar and the yen on the currency markets. The US and Japanese currencies both gained 0.3 per cent against the euro.A further dampener on risk appetite came from fresh turbulence in the Greek sovereign debt and credit markets as planned talks between Athens and officials from Europe and the IMF were delayed by the region-wide travel chaos.The yield on the Greek 10-year government bond jumped 24 basis points to 7.69 per cent, after reaching 7.76 per cent, a fresh high since Greece joined the eurozone, with its spread over German Bunds also hitting a record.The cost of insuring against a Greek sovereign debt default also touched its highest level on record.US Treasuries, by contrast, showed little response to the broadly heightened mood of risk aversion among investors. The yield on the 10-year note was up 4 basis point at 3.80 per cent.But commodity prices extended Friday’s losses. The S&P GSCI commodity spot index fell nearly 1/7 per cent, with US crude oil declining $1.58 a barrel to $81.14 and base metals suffering a broad retreat from last week’s highs.Gold shed 0.2 per cent to $1,135, in line with the dollar’s firmer tone.
523;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-04-09T21:27:46Z;Overview: Equities advance despite doubts over Greece;Greek bond yields pushed to 7.13%;Global equities hit their highest levels since mid-2008 this week, but optimism was tempered by continued sovereign risk worries, while talk swirled that China will allow an appreciation of its currency.Fears about Greece took centre stage as a holiday-shortened week for Europe began.On Friday, Fitch Ratings downgraded Greece’s long-term foreign and local currency ratings with a negative outlook, which made for choppy trading in Greek bonds, shares and the euro.But improved hopes for an agreement on a stability loan from the European Union helped ease some concern among investors.Heading into the weekend, investors were primed for “event risk” coming from either some resolution over Greece’s fiscal problems or the possibility that China could tweak its currency regime.“The lay of the land come Monday morning remains to be seen, therefore, but these two issues are certainly destined to remain the focus of attention across the financial markets for some time to come,” said Neil Mellor, strategist at BNY Mellon.Brian Yelvington, strategist at Knight Libertas, said: “We feel the ultimate decision will hinge on Greek willingness to succumb to the level of fiscal austerity that a bail-out will feature as its price tag.”At the end of trading in Europe on Friday, 10-year Greek government bonds were yielding 7.13 per cent, up from 6.54 per cent on the week, but down from Thursday’s spike to 7.58 per cent.Elsewhere, Portugal’s 10-year yields jumped to 4.33 per cent from 4.15 per cent, while Spain’s benchmark issue edged up 7bps to 3.87 per cent on the week.The strains in Greek debt, sent the spread of Greek bonds over 10-year German Bund yields towards 450bps, a record high since the start of the euro. For the week, 10-year Bunds rose 7bps to 3.16 per cent. In the UK, the onset of campaigning for the general election in May was accompanied by a rise in gilt yields, with 10-year paper climbing to 4.04 per cent from 3.92 per cent.In a week of contrasts, long-dated US Treasury yields rose to their highest level since October 2008 on Monday, ahead of $82bn in new debt sales, only for investors to subsequently step forward and eagerly buy the latest offerings.“The Treasury market passed a stern test this week,” said Bill O’Donnell, strategist at RBS Securities. “We learned this week that if you offer Treasury yields at range highs, the buyers will come.”From a peak of 4.01 per cent on Monday, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 3.86 per cent on Wednesday and was at 3.88 per cent on Friday, down 6bps on the week. The recent rise in US bond yields, however, has pushed 30-year home loan rates to their highest level since last August.In New York, the FTSE All world equity index was up 1.1 per cent on the week and at its highest level since September 2008, as equity markets rallied.In New York, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent on the week and closed at its highest level since September 2008 ahead of first-quarter earnings season starting next week.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.7 per cent to hit its highest level since September 2008, while London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5 per cent and touched its highest level since June 2008. In Asia, markets were mixed this week, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.7 per cent, while Hong Kong rose 3.1 per cent.In currencies trading, talk of China allowing its currency to appreciate against the dollar, helped boost the yen. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said a move to revalue the Chinese currency would be likely to spark “a broadly positive knee-jerk reaction in global markets across emerging markets and commodity currencies, global equity markets and commodity prices”. Such a rally for risk markets is based on an increase in Chinese purchasing power from the rest of the world, which further supports global growth, says the bank.Early in the week the dollar rose to its strongest level against the yen since August 2009, only for the yen to rebound and rise more than 1 per cent on the week. The yen also gained 1.8 per cent versus the euro.The euro was close to a 10-month low against the dollar, but trimmed its losses for the week on Friday on hopes of a rescue package for Greece.The Canadian dollar reached parity with the US this week for the first time since July 2008, but eased on Friday after the March jobs report showed less hiring than expected.In commodities, copper failed to hold above $8,000 a tonne, a level last seen in August 2008. Crude oil rallied above $87 a barrel, a new high since October 2008, only to close below $85 on Friday. Spot gold rose 3.5 per cent on the week in New York, hitting a three-month high of $1,160 an ounce on Friday.
524;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-04-07T21:40:34Z;Greece takes the edge off investor appetite;;Risk appetite suffered a modest deterioration on Wednesday amid persistent concerns about eurozone sovereign risk and uncertainty about the future course of the US economic recovery.Greek assets remained under severe pressure as investors fretted that the country’s financial position was looking increasingly precarious.Greece’s finance minister said on Wednesday that banks had asked for billions of euros of state support, heightening fears about Athens’ ability to fund its budget deficit, analysts said. Greek banking stocks tumbled a further 4.2 per cent as the spread of Greece’s 10-year government bond yields over their German counterparts widened to 407 basis points, a fresh high since the country joined the eurozone in 2001.Five-year Greek credit default swaps – a measure of the cost of insuring against a sovereign debt default – rose above 400bp, making it more risky than Iceland, according to Markit.Simon Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said there was little on the horizon to change investor perceptions about Greece until the outcome of the country’s roadshow to the US to raise funds later this month becomes clear.“However, given everything that has emerged so far, we suspect that investors will have little appetite to wait to find out how well – or badly – this goes. As a result it seems to us that the most likely outcome will be a sharp rise in downward pressure on the euro in the days ahead along with a continued ballooning in credit spreads.”But analysts noted the relative resilience of risk markets in the face of the latest eruption of Greek fears. The Vix volatility index, a closely watched gauge of risk aversion, ended on Tuesday at 16.23, its lowest level since October 9 2007, according to Reuters data – also the day on which the S&P 500 reached a record high. The Vix on Wednesday edged up 1.8 per cent to 16.5.Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said the ability of markets to shrug off Tuesday’s sharp spikes in Greek bond yields was impressive. “The only justification possibly is that the market now knows that the EU will, in effect, bail out Greece if forced to, and at this point spreads will tighten back,” he said.“The fact that they could widen a few hundred basis points to force the issue could be seen as noise and volatility en route to such an outcome. We’re not convinced it’s that simple but we can see the argument the market has for trying to isolate the problem.”The Fed sent mixed signals on US monetary policy. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, continued to say rates would be kept low until labour market conditions improved. But Thomas Hoenig, a Fed regional president who has dissented from past policy moves, said he could envision a rise to 1 per cent “sometime soon”.US consumer credit also fell by $11.5bn in February, far below expectations, reversing January’s gain in the measure of willingness to borrow and spend. “This was a disappointing report, showing that households are continuing to pare back,” said Theresa Chen, economist at Barclays Capital.The prospect of US rates staying low had relatively little impact on the currency markets as Greek concerns remained at the fore. The euro touched its lowest level against the dollar for a week, with appetite for the single currency also dented by fresh uncertainty about the outlook for the broader eurozone economy.US government bonds showed little reaction to the Fed’s confusion, as buyers were strongly attracted to the elevated yields at a sale of $21bn of 10-year paper, with the bid-to-cover ratio coming in at a record high of 3.72. By the close in New York, the yield on the 10-year note was down 9bp at 3.87 per cent.US and European equities eased back from 18-month highs, with the S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 also shedding 0.3 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average inched up 0.1 per cent.Commodity prices mostly retreated from recent peaks as the dollar rallied. Crude oil slid towards $85 a barrel after earlier reaching $87, while copper dipped from a 20-month high. But gold rose to a three-month peak above $1,150 an ounce.
525;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-03-31T21:58:44Z;Gloomy US job figures halt equity progress;;Uncertainty about the outlook for US employment kept financial markets on tenterhooks on Wednesday as investors took stock of what has been a broadly positive quarter for risky assets.Participants hoping for a strong rise in Friday’s crucial non-farm payrolls number were unsettled by a survey from ADP Employers’ Services showing that the US private sector shed 23,000 jobs in March compared with expectations for an increase of 40,000.The consensus among economists is for a rise in March payrolls of 190,000. But analysts noted that the two series differed hugely in their methods of calculation, with payrolls likely to be positively affected by both the unwinding of the adverse weather impact earlier in the year and by substantial hiring of census workers.“Although the US labour market is on the mend, it is difficult to gain an accurate sense of the extent of this improvement given the quality of the underlying data,” said Michael Woolfolk, of Bank of New York Mellon.On the currency markets, the dollar retreated from a three-month high against the yen following the ADP report’s release while the euro rallied back above $1.35.US government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the two-year Treasury down 4 basis points to 1.02 per cent and the 10-year down 1bp to 3.85 per cent.“The market reaction to the ADP numbers has been disappointing but this looks more like a temporary setback than a sea-change in risk sentiment,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Securities.Mortgages weakened sharply against Treasuries and 30-year coupons on Fannie Mae rose above 4.5 per cent, as the Federal Reserve completed its $1,250bn purchase program.Meanwhile, the fragility of the eurozone recovery was highlighted by news that the region’s unemployment rate had reached 10 per cent in February – the highest for 11 years – while consumer price inflation jumped to a 15-month high of 1.5 per cent in March.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said there was evidence that underlying price pressures remained largely muted while further increases in unemployment were likely to hold down wage growth and limit consumer spending.“Consequently, there remains a compelling case for the European Central Bank to keep interest rates at 1 per cent not only at its April 8 policy meeting but also until 2011,” Mr Archer said. “Furthermore, the ECB will probably continue to tread lightly in withdrawing its emergency liquidity measures.”The ECB was asked for €17.9bn ($24bn) of funds at its final six-month long-term refinancing operation on Wednesday, much less than expected. Giuseppe Maraffino, fixed income strategist at UniCredit, said this offered a clear sign that banks’ liquidity needs had declined in recent months and that they no longer needed to participate in long-term operations.“Importantly, [these] results should ease concerns related to the effect of the expiration of the 12-month LTRO on July 1 [when €442bn is due to be repaid] on banks’ liquidity needs and on the market.”But a reminder of the headwinds facing peripheral eurozone economies came from news that Moody’s Investors Service had downgraded five Greek banks.Greek government bonds fell sharply, with the yield spread over German Bunds widening.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 equity index ended the session 0.1 per cent lower – but recorded a 2.8 per cent gain in the three months from January to March, a fourth successive quarterly rise. In New York, the S&P 500 had its best first-quarter gain since 1998, although it closed 0.3 per cent lower on Wednesday.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 eased 0.1 per cent but rose 5.2 per cent over the three-month period.The broad decline in risk aversion during the quarter was illustrated by an 18 per cent drop in the Vix volatility index to 17.7.In commodities, US oil climbed above $83 a barrel even after a rise in crude inventories last week, although copper retreated from a 19-month high. The weaker tone of the dollar pushed gold up slightly to $1,114 an ounce.
526;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-03-26T14:55:32Z;US economic growth revised down to 5.6%;;The US economy grew at a slower rate than previously thought in the fourth quarter of last year on weaker consumer spending and commercial property investment, signalling a longer path to recovery.Meanwhile, separate figures on Friday showed consumer sentiment muted and unemployment remaining stubbornly high across US states.Revised commerce department figures showed economic output growing at an adjusted annual rate of 5.6 per cent, lower than the 5.9 per cent growth estimated last month. Economists had not expected the latest revision to be different from the previous estimate.In spite of the downward revision, the fourth-quarter growth marked a substantial turnaround for the economy and was its strongest three months in the past six years. It also helped salvage a grim 2009 when output contracted by 2.4 per cent, the economy’s worst annual performance since 1946.Fourth-quarter output was fuelled by an aggressive move by businesses to stabilise inventories after a long stretch of liquidation. Businesses shed just $19.7bn in inventories after purging $139.2bn in the third quarter. That added 3.79 percentage points to the growth rate.The shift in inventories signals future production and greater output from manufacturers. However, economists warned that the inventory swing can only occur once per cycle and that other parts of the economy will have to sustain the momentum.“While the headline number remains impressive, its dependence upon inventory rebuilding is a potential source of concern for those hoping for similar levels of growth in 2010,” said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon.Meanwhile, corporate earnings grew at slower pace in the fourth quarter of last year, with profits after taxes gaining 6.5 per cent after climbing 12.7 per cent in the third quarter. Last year, profits after taxes fell 6.9 per cent.In February, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, pointed to a “nascent” economic recovery that has been lifted by a general improvement in financial conditions. He warned, however, that the rate of economic growth will slow later this year and that the recovery will depend on growth of private-sector appetite for goods and services.Consumer spending continues to lag behind and the 1.6 per cent growth in personal consumption was weaker than last month’s estimate. Analysts are keeping a close watch on consumers’ behaviour, as spending accounts for about 70 per cent of economic activity in the US.On Friday, the Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment showed confidence flat in March, with its index holding steady at 73.6. Richard Curtin, chief economist of the survey, said that consumers expect the economy to improve but are less optimistic about their personal financial situations.Unemployment continues to cast gloom over consumers’ moods and labour department figures on Friday showed more than half of US states recording rises in their unemployment rates last month. Florida, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina recorded record rates of unemployment in February, while Michigan maintained the country’s highest jobless rate at 14.1 per cent.
527;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-03-26T12:29:40Z;Overview: EU summit puts sovereign risk in spotlight;;Sovereign risk was again in the spotlight as European Union leaders convened a summit over a financial safety net for Greece.European stocks rallied 1 per cent on hopes of the European plan put forward by Germany and France being accepted, and late on Thursday European leaders agreed to allow the International Monetary Fund to help Greece.That move, however, aroused opposition from Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, who spoke after European markets had closed and pushed the euro down to a fresh 10-month low late in New York. Wall Street, already bruised by another poorly received sale of US Treasury debt, also turned negative in late trade after Mr Trichet spoke.The ECB chief told French television: “If the IMF …exercises any responsibility instead of the euro group, instead of the governments, this would clearly be very, very bad.”Investors had been watching the summit closely.“What’s going on with Greece is emblematic of bigger sovereign problems,” said David Bianco, chief equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Further evidence of the level of unease felt by markets about the eurozone came from reports that Zhu Min, a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, had said the Greek debt crisis was just the “tip of the iceberg”.Simon Derrick, at Bank of New York Mellon, said this was a good indication of how rapidly fundamental worries were growing about the eurozone.“Indeed, this comment might well signal the point that we stop talking about a ‘Greek debt crisis’ and start talking about a ‘eurozone structural crisis’ instead,” Mr Derrick said.Earlier, the ECB said it would maintain relatively loose collateral requirements for borrowing from the central bank throughout next year, drastically reducing the chances that Greek government bonds would become ineligible in the bank’s refinancing operations.On the currency markets, the euro sank to a 10-month low either side of a brief rebound during the day.Many analysts felt the euro’s slide still had further to go. “We were already expecting the euro to fall to $1.25 by the end of the year, but now think $1.20 is more likely,” said Capital Economics.“The reason we have revised our dollar/euro forecast is that prospects for recovery in the eurozone have deteriorated,” it added.US government bonds suffered a further sell-off after a disappointing sale of $32bn seven-year notes – just a day after investors gave a poor reception to an auction of five-year paper.The yield on the 10-year Treasury touched its highest level since last June. At the end of the day it was up 3bp at 3.88 per cent, having risen to 3.92 per cent.Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital, said: “In time we see the dollar as becoming a target for sovereign risk concerns as US bond supply and fiscal deficits return to the market’s attention.”Optimism that some form of backstop for Greece’s debt would be achieved had helped to drive the yield on the country’s 10-year bonds down 8 basis points to 6.28 per cent, narrowing the spread over German Bunds to 313bp. The Greek five-year credit default swap tightened 14bp to 308bp, according to data from Markit.Meanwhile, Dubai’s five-year CDS narrowed 35bp to 390bp after news that the government would support the debt restructuring of its Dubai World conglomerate to the tune of $9.5bn.That news helped underpin equity markets in Europe, and for a time in New York, with Wall Street boosted by encouraging US earnings reports and labour market data.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average inched up 0.1 per cent. The S&P 500 was up as much as 1.1 per cent in early afternoon trade, before the benchmark closed down 0.2 per cent.Commodity prices were mixed as the dollar drove higher but investors took a more positive view on the global recovery. Crude oil fell 8 cents to $80.53 a barrel but gold edged up 0.4 per cent to $1,091 a troy ounce, and copper pushed 0.9 per cent higher.
528;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
529;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-03-15T19:46:18Z;Foreign demand for US assets falls;;Foreign governments and central banks sold a record amount of US financial assets in January as China continued to reduce its holdings of Treasuries, government figures showed on Monday.Demand for corporate debt also fell, with private foreign investors shedding a record $24.8bn of corporate bonds while also shying away from equities and US agency debt.China sold $5.8bn of Treasury securities in January, the third month running that it cut its holdings. However, revisions to previous months helped it regain its position as the top holder of US government debt, overtaking Japan.January saw a drop in overall demand for US assets, with net purchases of bonds, notes and equities falling to $19.1bn in January from $63.3bn in December, according to the Treasury International Capital data, known as Tic. Foreign governments and central banks sold $34.1bn.Any move by China is closely watched because it is the biggest and most politically sensitive US trade partner. Mounting US debt levels and the need by the US to fund a record budget deficit have raised concerns that this may hit the US dollar and weaken demand for US assets.At the weekend, Wen Jiabao, Chinese premier, said pressure surrounding its currency policy amounted to protectionism and he argued that the renminbi was not undervalued.“There is such an imbalance between trade and investment flows between the US and China, that it requires an increasing level of Chinese demand for government bonds,” said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon.“If China decides to stop purchases of government bonds, then we have a problem.”Analysts cautioned that the change in China’s monthly holdings was in part due to debt maturing. The US Treasury department pointed out that China’s investments often run through offshore entities, making it possible that its US investments were appearing as holdings in Britain or Hong Kong.There are also concerns that the monthly data – released with a two-month lag – gives only a partial picture of foreign investor appetite. Analysts at Capital Economics said the data were “too volatile from month-to-month to draw any meaningful conclusions” and that they did not cover direct investment, “considered to be a more reliable source of finance than portfolio flows”.“It makes much more sense to look at the prices paid for US assets, rather than the quantities bought,” Capital Economics said. “In fact, the dollar rose during January, and Treasury yields fell, which is hard to square with the idea that foreigners lost any appetite for US assets.”Some analysts expect foreign investors to regain their appetite for US corporate bonds. “Our outlook is for the foreign investor to return as a net buyer of US corporate bonds as the credit market has normalised and sovereign uncertainty diverts to the US flows that would otherwise have gone to western Europe,” said Bank of America.
530;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-03-15T16:11:11Z;Deutsche Bank names pair to Oppenheim;;Deutsche Bank moved quickly to strengthen the management of Sal Oppenheim after completing the takeover of the crisis-hit private bank for €1bn.Germany’s largest bank named two of its executives, Jürgen Dobritzsch and Jürgen Fiedler, to oversee financial control and risk management on an expanded executive board at Sal Oppenheim, which ran into trouble during the financial crisis. Another former Deutsche banker, Wilhelm von Haller, had already been installed as chief executive at its new subsidiary.Deutsche Bank says the acquisition of 220-year-old Sal Oppenheim, announced last October, makes it the largest wealth manager among eurozone banks. It will concentrate on private banking and wealth management for German clients while winding down Sal Oppenheim’s investment banking activities and filleting other parts of what was one of Europe’s biggest privately-owed banks.Sal Oppenheim’s equity trading and derivatives unit will be taken over by Australia’s Macquarie, which is expanding in Europe, while BNY Mellon is to buy the asset servicing business of BHF Bank, another private banking and wealth management specialist owned by Sal Oppenheim but not integrated. Deutsche Bank is looking to sell the rest of BHF.As well as appointing Mr Dobritzsch as chief financial officer and Mr Fiedler as chief risk officer, “further sustainable reduction of risk positions and a strengthening of control functions within Sal Oppenheim will be undertaken,” Deutsche said on Monday.Sal Oppenheim had €137bn of assets under management at the end of last year while Deutsche Bank had more than €170bn in mid-2009 in its private wealth management business.The acquisition reflects Deutsche Bank’s insistence after the financial crisis that it can pick up good businesses from stricken rivals. It also last year expanded in the Dutch market after buying corporate banking activities that used to belong to ABN Amro.
531;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-02-21T16:53:06Z;Consultancy focuses analysis on behaviour of traders;;As alternative fund houses increasingly look for a new edge to attract assets, two former hedge fund traders are pushing a new system of portfolio screening, coupled with personal coaching inspired by techniques used on eastern Europe’s football fields.Taras Chaban and Peter Harnett, who together managed more than $1bn (£642m, €738m) in long-short equities, including a $500m mandate for a large sovereign wealth fund, have taken a system they pioneered at hedge fund specialist GLG and packaged it for wider consumption.During their time at GLG, the duo constructed portfolios based on behavioural analysis of brokers’ recommendations, and have since adapted the process into the core service provided by TradeEq, their newly created London-based consultancy.The pair attempt to strip apart portfolios to identify the skill and trading patterns of a particular manager, through analysis of portfolio weightings, preferences for stocks of a particular size and returns related to a stock’s volatility. “People are analysing enormous volumes of data on every trading desk,” says Mr Chaban. “But nobody is actually analysing the behaviour of the traders.”Many of these traders prefer the safety of low volatility stocks, although this bias typically eats into returns, believes Mr Chaban, with little attention given to hedging blue-chip stocks such as Tesco and J Sainsbury, leading to losses that mount up over a longer period.“Low volatility stocks are perceived as safer to trade or hold, but there is not as much analysis or conviction in the trades and they can be held in portfolios in slightly lazy positions,” he says. “When people hold higher volatility stocks, they tend to do more research and hold them with a deeper conviction.”But traders may be surprised about the intrusive nature of the monitoring and coaching courses proposed by TradeEq, although the duo’s former employer, GLG, has already signed up for the service for all of the managers of its 30-strong European equity funds range, ecompassing both long-short and traditional portfolios.The next stage involves use of biometric techniques, attaching sensors to the portfolio manager’s body to monitor indicators including blood pressure, sweat levels and most importantly of all, heart rate variability, while reacting to various market stimuli.“There is evidence in research, that the more variable the heart rate, the better your performance in all intellectual activity, not just portfolio trading,” claims Mr Chaban.By wiring up traders, and judging their performance and reactions in different stock pools, across different time horizons, months of the year and when in different stages of the manager’s profit and loss account,TradeEq aims to identify when the traders perform well and badly and to improve their skills in all conditions.These analytical techniques owe a huge debt to bio-feedback methods developed in the sporting arena. Mr Chaban first witnessed them in his native Ukraine, where the late Dynamo Kiev football club manager Valery Lobanovski, used a system of physical sensors to improve the reaction of his players including stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, later to play for AC Milan and Chelsea, to possible patterns of events on the pitch.Mr Chaban has regular dialogue with Oleg Luzhny, who captained the Dynamo and Ukrainian national teams under Mr Lobanovski and now coaches the Dynamo team in the Ukrainian capital.Behavioural finance techniques have long been used by US consultants such as Investor Analytics, which has a strategic alliance with Bank of New York Mellon to provide enterprise-wide risk evaluations to institutional investors.“Traditional models hold that prices move in a ‘random walk’, where each tick is independent of all previous ticks, but we know that trading clusters occur,” says Damian Handzy, chief executive of Investor Analytics. But he also warns about falling for knee-jerk reactions to markets working in unpredictable ways, rather than taking time to understand market movements in depth.“Behavioural theory gives a much more realistic assessment of what both security prices and critically, the people managing the funds, are likely to do in market crises,” ventures Mr Handzy. “It’s not just about fat-tail modelling. It’s about modelling how real people react to markets behaving badly.”Prominent hedge fund traders are divided as to whether the techniques could have any benefit amongst their peer group.Zbigniew Hermaszewski, principal of Altis Partners, believes the service might be of use to traders suffering a crisis of confidence. “If you are down 5, 10 or 15 per cent, you can lose the conviction that you are right and slip more into self doubt,” believes Mr Hermaszewski.But Carsten Schroeder, a managed futures and options specialist at Amplitude Capital, says hedge fund managers should not trust outsiders with boosting their returns.“When it comes to the core of a business, which is investment strategy, I would not be comfortable with using a consultant. If he is that good, why isn’t he running his own hedge fund, where he can make substantially more money than from consulting?”
532;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-02-19T22:16:54Z;Analyst note helps boost large US banks;;US equities continued the week’s rally, shrugging off a sharp initial sell-off in reaction to the Fed’s announcement after the market’s close on Thursday that it had raised its discount rate.The S&P 500 ended higher on the week on a second consecutive occasion for only the first time since December. Investors were comforted by the lower-than-expected consumer price index figures. It was the first month-on-month decline in core CPI since 1982 and suggested that US inflation was under control.Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial, said: “This morning’s CPI figures were exactly the tonic the market needed. The markets were reassured that ‘the Fed is still my friend’.”The figures acted as a balance to Thursday’s unexpectedly high producer price index figures. Mr White said the divergence of the two inflation measures implied that producers were experiencing higher prices but were not currently able to pass them on to consumers.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 1,109.17, marking a 3.1 per cent increase on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,402.35 and 2.9 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,243.87 and rose 2.6 per cent on the week.Volumes, however, were lower than average due to Monday’s public holiday and school winter vacations.The financial sector was in focus late in the week due to its perceived sensitivity to a rate hike.Large US banks broadly improved, helped by a positive note on the sector from analysts at Morgan Stanley.Most banks mentioned in the note moved higher on Friday. Bank of New York Mellonimproved 3.5 per cent to $28.66, Northern Trust Corp rose 4.1 per cent to $54.60 and Morgan Stanley rose 0.6 per cent to $27.41. JPMorgan Chase bucked the trend, retreating 0.9 per cent to $40.03.“If this group trades down because investors assume that rising rates for the bank group is a negative, we strongly recommend investors buy,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.“The discount window rate hike signals rising confidence in the recovery,” they said. The broker is overweight large US banks “as we believe less bad is good for the stocks”.Citigroup strengthened 7.4 per cent during the week to $3.42, boosted by filings that revealed hedge funds run by prominent investors such as George Soros and John Paulson had increased their holdings in the bank in the last quarter.Also in the financial sector Charles Schwab, an independent broker, gained 5.2 per cent to $18.73 Friday as Goldman Sachs raised the stock to “neutral” from “sell” and increased the price target on the stock to $18.A dearth of significant mergers and acquisitions activity helped the $4.1bn acquisition of fertiliser maker Terra Industries by Norwegian rival Yara International stand out. The news sent Terra shares 24.5 per cent higher on the week to $41.30.A number of retail giants reported encouraging quarterly figures during the week. Department store operator JC Penneyyesterday rose 6.6 per cent to $27.66 on its fourth-quarter results. It reported better profits than many expected, and said same-store sales would be in the “low single digits” for the full fiscal year. The stock was up 11 per cent on the week.Whole Foods gained 13.1 per cent to $33.66 over the week following the release of its results on Tuesday.Walmart reported comparable-store sales that failed to match expectations, but still rose 1 per cent on the week to $53.49.Shares in Walgreens the largest US drugstore chain, gained 3.9 per cent during the week to $34.86 as it announced it was to buy rival Duane Reade for $1.1bn
533;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Brazil shows signs of fatigue;;Although China has tended to be the key focus among the Brics, Brazil has also been important to global investors recently – and it is worth noting recent signs of fatigue there, says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.He points out that Brazil was the biggest gainer in the MSCI Emerging Markets index in 2009. The Bovespa index soared 100 per cent from mid-March to year-end. “But 2010 has been a different story, with the Bovespa down 7.5 per cent year-to-date and hovering near its 100-day moving average,” he says. “The last time the index succumbed to this technical level, it began a 60 per cent retracement through the second half of 2008.”Mr Mellor says BNY Mellon flow data show four successive daily net outflows of equity capital from the Brazilian market – a fairly rare occurrence in the past 12 months. Moreover, this follows two months in which net inflows into the country have consistently flattened.“Policymakers globally are steadily drawing up plans for the removal of stimuli and Brazil may be about to play its part,” he says. “Indeed, there are signs the central bank is gearing up to raise rates in the next few months.“Given its growing presence in the emerging market portfolio, the Brazilian equity market should be seen as a good lead indicator of investor sentiment. It is still early days, but current signals, from both a technical and flow-related standpoint, do not bode particularly well.”
534;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-02-11T21:52:36Z;Investors bewildered by EU deal over Greece;Equity markets rebound but euro slips and gold soars;"21:30 GMT. News that a meeting of European leaders had agreed a ‘deal’ to assist Greece left markets bewildered on Thursday.Stocks, bonds and the euro vacillated, while gold soared as traders tried to work out whether they were relieved that the EU stood ready to support Greece if required; were disappointed at a lack of concrete proposals; or were happy that the lack of unconditional aid meant Athens was still required to make tough decisions to solve its fiscal woes.At the same time, there were signs that traders were reassessing whether any potential rescue was positive for the long-term health of the European economy, given that it could allow difficult fiscal decisions to be shunned and may mean the debt problems were simply spread out rather than exorcised.“We believe that the whole ‘bail-out’ scenario constitutes a double-edged sword, with assistance only serving to undermine the euro’s interests in the long run,” said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.“Put simply, ‘rewarding’ Greece’s profligacy rips the lid off a moral hazard can of worms that was opened with the de facto abandonment of the fiscal stability criteria early in the millennium.”● The euro plunged in early New York trading as the realisation took hold that the eurozone was “damned if they do and damned if they don’t” help Greece. The single currency at one stage lost more than 1 per cent to breach $1.36 versus the dollar and flirt with fresh eight-month lows. It ended the day down 0.3 per cent versus the dollar and off 0.6 per cent against a yen that was itself buoyed by haven flows as risk appetite waned.This shift in sentiment provided some support to the dollar, which was down only slightly, less than 1 per cent, against a basket of its peers in spite of a decent drop in demand for US government bonds.The Australian dollar jumped 1.8 per cent against the greenback after a far better than expected employment report encouraged traders to shorten the odds on a March interest rate rise.● Greek government bond yields reduced an initial large drop as markets absorbed details of the eurozone’s bail-out plans. Having at one stage breached 5.75 per cent, the yield on the 10-year bond was later trading down just 6 basis points at 5.94 per cent.However, the debt of the other so-called peripheral economies, such as Portugal, managed to maintain some interest – its yield dipped 13 basis points.German 10-year Bund yields rose 4 basis points to 3.23 per cent, pushing the yield spread with Greek debt to 273 basis points.Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said that the trade of favouring the debt of “cyclically blessed” nations over that of the “structurally impaired” was under threat as the core of Europe edged closer to taking on the obligations of its fiscally hampered periphery.“We would now favour selling Bunds against those markets whose structural impairment, while still significant, has long been well known,” he concluded.US 10-year government bond yields rose 2 basis points to 3.72 per cent. The Treasury auctioned $16bn of 30-year, the third of three planned auctions this week totalling $81bn. The 30-year bonds priced at a yield of 4.72 per cent, versus a forecast of 4.69 per cent in a Bloomberg News survey.“The auctions have gone relatively poorly, starting with the three-year, where demand had previously been strong,” said Michael Pond, interest rate strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. “Obviously the news out of Europe this week has been bearish for Treasuries, and the flight to liquidity has reversed.”● Gold bugs enjoyed one of those relatively rare days when the dollar’s moves counted for little and investors seemed to pile into the precious metal out of sheer frustration with the machinations of the forex markets.

535;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-02-10T15:30:20Z;Germany’s eurozone sea-change;A German bail-out would represent a eurozone sea-change;Pressure on Germany to bail out Greece is fundamentally bearish for the euro, argues Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon.He says one of the great constants for the currency markets has been that Germany would always fight to protect the credibility of its fiscal and monetary policy. But if Germany does agree to a bail-out it would mark a sea-change. It would be the first time in modern market history, that Germany had failed to stick to this austere message,” he says.He says that although it might be right for Germany to come to the rescue, it should lead to a significant reassessment of how investors look at the euro. “Given that one of the euro’s principal roles over the past decade has been to act as the world’s second reserve currency, a role it took over from the deutschemark, this does not sound like a positive,” says Mr Derrick.“If Germany is to effectively provide a guarantee to help underpin Greece then it will also come under pressure to provide similar support for Portugal, Spain and beyond.”He says while in the very short term, the euro may benefit from a relief rally, in the longer term the trend will be resolutely lower.“On the bright side, if the cost of preserving political union is a weaker currency over time then perhaps this isn’t that great a cost to bear,” says Mr Derrick.
536;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-02-02T22:53:37Z;BNY Mellon to buy back-office arm of PNC;;Bank of New York Mellon on Tuesday announced it would pay $2.31bn to acquire the back-office operations of PNC Financial Services Group, a deal that comes amid expectations that more financial firms will shed businesses to shore up their capital bases and pay off federal aid.The deal will allow PNC to exit a non-core business, while helping it raise money to repay $7.6bn in government troubled asset relief programme (Tarp) funds. PNC also said it would sell $3bn of common stock and as much as $2bn of senior notes to pay back federal aid.Jim Palermo, the co-chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon Asset Servicing, said he expects to see other banks make similar deals in the months ahead.“We think there is a fairly high likelihood that this type of consolidation will continue,” Mr Palermo said.Tom McKelvey, the chief operating officer of Capco, a financial consulting firm, said that banks, unlike companies in other industries that outsourced or slimmed down years ago, continued to own too much of the supply chain.“We are talking to a number of our clients about selling large components of their businesses,” he said.Mr McKelvey said that back-office functions such as reconciliation, syndication and settlement activities will increasingly reside with third parties who specialise in those areas, much the way Visa and Mastercard process credit card transactions but do not make loans.He said that only the nation’s six largest banks have scale in syndicated lending, making that an area ripe for divestiture by smaller players.State Street Corporation recently spent $1.87bn to acquire the securities services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, the large Italian banking group.And Citigroup this month sold its technology services division to India’s Wipro for $127m. Other banks that have sold back-office operations in recent years include Fifth Third Bank, Marshall & Ilsley and Synovus.Standard & Poor’s analyst Erik Oja said that in a better economy banks would prefer to keep their back-office operations, because they lessen their dependence on earning money through lending activities. “But in this economy, you are going to see more banks look to sell,” he said.A PNC spokesman pointed out that its sale of the back-office division, which handles processing for financial advisers, fund managers and brokers, was a strategic decision that was not simply motivated by financial concerns.He added that increasing its capital base and repaying Tarp were among the bank’s priorities this year.S&P’s Oja estimates that PNC will be able to repay the bulk of its Tarp funds by the end of this year, saving it $388m beginning in 2011.As a result, he raised his 2011 earnings estimate to $5.24 per share from $5.03 per share.PNC shares were down 1.83 per cent at $54.84 in afternoon trading.
537;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-01-26T18:58:49Z;Shifting sentiment hits credit and equities rally;;The bull market rally that has dramatically lifted credit and equity markets since last March may finally be running out of steam.After a strong start to the year, sentiment has changed sharply in the last week, dragging equities and commodity prices sharply lower, while government bonds are benefiting from a renewed flight to safety.“We’ve been proponents of the more shoes to drop thesis for some time now even as we remain constructive on global economic recovery and the recovery of the global capital markets,” says John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities. “The world simply cannot emerge from the worst financial crisis in modern history effortlessly.”In the past week, a number of developments have damaged the bullish start to the year for global stocks and credit, which has now pushed many equity benchmarks into negative territory for the year. The catalyst for much angst has been China’s move to apply the brakes to its easy money policy of last year, which helped the global economy bounce from the slough of deep recession.“Whether or not the Chinese economy is as susceptible to a downturn as many would believe, what matters is that fear over the potential impact of monetary tightening has nonetheless gripped the market,” says Neil Mellor, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He says there has been a continued net outflow of equity capital from China in recent weeks, marked by a notable, outbound acceleration over the past fortnight as the yield on weekly bill auctions has risen in China and reserve requirements for Chinese banks have been increased.Across the Pacific, plans by President Barack Obama to regulate US banks and uncertainty as to whether Ben Bernanke will be reconfirmed for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve have also rattled markets as the spectre of political risk has flared.“When you change the playing field [in terms of regulation] people get nervous,” says Glenn Pohs, managing director for options at Cohen Capital on the NYSE floor.One of the biggest worries in Europe has been deteriorating public finances of some of the eurozone economies, most notably Greece. This has put pressure on the euro, which has fallen nearly 3 per cent against the dollar in the past two weeks.Although the Greeks successfully raised €8bn in the capital markets on Tuesday, worries over sovereign risk in the eurozone remain a threat to stability.The renewed turmoil across risk markets also comes at a time when central banks are trying to outline a path whereby they wean investors off extraordinary liquidity support measures. China’s move is just the start of a long process which could make for volatile trading across markets this year. Above all, investors fear a policy mistake such as tightening too soon which provokes a renewed slump in activity.It is against this backdrop that Asian shares have fallen for the past seven trading days, their worst run for two years. Hong Kong shares have dropped more than 10 per cent from this month’s peak, meeting the definition of a standard market correction.An outlook downgrade to negative for Japan’s sovereign credit rating helped on Tuesday extend losses for the Nikkei 225 Average to about 6 per cent over the past three trading sessions.In London, the FTSE 100 opened lower on Tuesday, following four daily declines. European equities are also in the firing line, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 having dropped 5 per cent in the past five days.Emerging markets are also under heavy pressure, with Brazilian stocks falling more than 8 per cent from this month’s high.In the US, the S&P 500 turned negative for the year last Friday and has now dropped around 5 per cent from its recent peak. Some investors are wary that after a rise of some 70 per cent since March, the S&P is due for a standard correction of at least 10 per cent.Offsetting the selling pressure and sharp jump in equity volatility has been a reasonably solid set of fourth-quarter earnings from US companies.For the US markets, uncertainty is unlikely to ease soon as investors watch the confirmation process of Mr Bernanke unfold, the central bank’s rate decision due later on Tuesday and President Obama’s State of the Union address on Tuesday evening. Next week, crucial data on the US labour market arrives, at a time of anxiety over high unemployment.“The equity market outlook is complicated by strong earnings fundamentals, but should near-term support at 1090 [in the S&P 500 index] fail to hold after the president announces new taxes on the so-called wealthy in his address, a deeper correction is likely to materialise,” says Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities.The return of risk aversion has also disrupted a heated rally in the corporate bond market that lured both US and foreign companies to sell billions of dollars of debt at low borrowing rates earlier this month.“It is a widespread pullback with the banks, especially the brokers, underperforming,” says Jeff Meli, a credit strategist at Barclays Capital.“In light of the number of regulatory proposals that have come out in a short period of time, the market is having a difficult time forming a cogent view as to what the future will be and that has created a lot of uncertainty,” he added.Jeffrey Rosenberg, head of credit strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says: “Government policy intervention stood behind the remarkable rehabilitation in credit in 2009 and, as a result, a policy error stands as the greatest risk to the outlook in 2010.”A barometer of US equity risk aversion has flared in the past week as stocks have been hit by renewed political and policy concerns, writes Michael Mackenzie.Equity volatility – as measured by the Vix index of 30-day options written on the S&P – has broken out of a downtrend that began in December and then pulled the barometer below the key level of 20 this month.Since the financial crisis emerged in July 2007, Vix has generally stayed above 20 and, in November 2008, it peaked at 80.86.During 2007 and 2008, however, there were four notable periods when Vix dropped below 20, only to surge back as stocks came under pressure.“The tribulations of the past couple of years have left investors with an elevated equity risk premium compared with the 1980s, 1990s and much of the 2000s,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi.The big question now facing investors – after a spike of more than 50 per cent in Vix last week and the consolidation around a reading of 24 on Tuesday – is whether this is a harbinger of further weakness in stocks or a rocky interlude.At its current level, Vix is up by about 30 per cent from a recent low of about 17.50 per cent.“The recent rise in Vix is not a surprise,” says Glenn Pohs, managing director for options at Cohen Capital on the New York Stock Exchange floor. “Complacency drives Vix lower and fear drives it higher.”That said, some warn that following Vix may not be the right approach for investors.Mr Levkovich argues that Vix is a “pedestrian measure”, as once it has moved and signals something, it is too late for investors to respond meaningfully.“Vix isn’t quite the fear gauge people think it is,” he says. “When something is too easy to measure, it loses its power.”
538;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-01-22T23:12:52Z;Infineon directors attack activist campaign;;Infineon’s board would be thrown into “chaos” and “paralysis” if institutional investors oust the chairman-designate of the German chipmaker, non-executive directors have warned.The battle between investors and the company has turned into a test case on corporate governance in Germany,senior members of the country’s business establishment against big domestic and international investors.The campaign led by Hermes , the UK activist investor, gathered momentum on Friday as Legal & General and Bank of New York Mellon published proposals calling for a change in chairman at the chipmaker.Klaus Wucherer, Infineon’s proposed candidate, is regarded by several shareholders as not representing “a new start” on the board as he has been a director for a decade. Shareholders have proposed Willi Berchtold, the finance chief of one of Germany’s largest private companies, as a replacement.But Wigand Cramer, one of the employee representatives on the supervisory board, criticised the investors for lacking clarity.“Neither Hermes nor Mr Berchtold have said what they really want. Their only argument is a fresh start but this alone is not a sufficient argument,” Mr Cramer told the Financial Times.Another Infineon supervisory board member warned against making Mr Berchtold chairman: “It would be chaos if it happened. You could have a totally paralysed supervisory board.”Infineon declined to comment. The company is expected to go through more pain in coming years, with possible job losses and factory closures, and directors fear that Mr Berchtold’s appointment would antagonise workers, whose support would be needed for the restructuring.“It is hitting the wrong company at the wrong time. It could cause a lot of damage to Infineon,” said an executive close to the chipmaker.Mr Cramer said that employees had suffered enough under a painful restructuring that cut the workforce by a third.“Mr Wucherer is not a great friend of the unions, but he is a competent person with a long experience in restructuring and technology,” Mr Cramer said.Directors also believe that Infineon has become significantly more stable since last year’s annual meeting, where shareholders narrowly approved the board’s actions.Infineon’s share price has risen 10-fold since its low point last March of €0.35.
539;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-01-21T16:39:00Z;Greece’s woes have a familiar ring;;Recent market developments related to Greece are reminiscent of past crises, says Simon Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. He points out that Greek credit default swaps have essentially followed the same path taken by Icelandic CDS in the run-up to the crisis there.Going back further, he compares the widening of Greek yield spreads over Bunds during the past 90 days with that seen in the price of sterling against its European neighbours prior to its exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, and the French franc against the deutschmark in 1993.“There was a slow build-up of forces in the first 30 days, a sharp rise in pressure during the second 30, a pull-back for two or three weeks as the stresses seemed to subside and then a dramatic resumption of the assault – with the break coming relatively quickly as investor confidence collapsed.”Mr Derrick notes that the responses from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank to Greece’s woes have a familiar ring to them.“In particular, they are reminiscent of the hard-line stance that the Bundesbank took on monetary policy in the summer of 1992 that, ultimately, acted as the catalyst for sterling’s exit from the ERM.“While it is unclear what the ultimate outcome will be this time, it seems clear that investors are not waiting to find out.”
540;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-01-18T18:20:35Z;Short View: The un-dollar;;"It used to be so simple; where the S&P 500 went, so went the euro. In the so-called “risk on” trade, investors bought stocks and sold dollars for other currencies, including the euro. When they took risk off, they dropped stocks, sold those exotic currencies and bought dollars.But since mid-December, the euro has fallen heavily, even as the S&P 500 has continued to edge higher. On Monday, the single currency managed a slight gain, but then US markets were closed.If 2009 was about big, broad-brush trading themes as simple as switching risk on and off, 2010 is about selecting investment bets more carefully now that the easy money has been made. Sovereign risk is one of the main filters for investment selection and this does not bode well for the euro.Investors are jittery about Greece’s terrible finances and, to a lesser extent, concerned too about the outlook for Portugal, Italy and Spain.It has always been hard to be positive on the euro, and the political machinations of a 16-member currency union have not helped. When the euro has gained, it has often been about negative US factors rather than an upbeat view on Europe. This has even led to the single currency being nicknamed the “un-dollar.”That is not to say there have been no positives. There has been genuine, long-running support from central banks’ desire to dilute their dollar reserves. Only the euro has markets deep enough to absorb significant amounts of this.But even this may be easing. Analysts at Bank of New York Mellon point to a slowing, and in some cases a net outflow, of funds into key emerging markets, where efforts to limit currency appreciation have led to huge currency reserves.If these slower flows continue, this would limit future reserve build-up and reduce the need for reserve managers to buy more euros.It seems the 2010 currency version of a “risk-on” trade might be going long the euro.www.ft.com/shortviewjennifer.hughes@ft.comJohn Authers is away"
541;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-01-17T09:51:41Z;Active funds no good, says ex-CSAM boss;;"Credit Suisse’s former UK fund unit head says he set up a specialist passive investment boutique because mutual funds do not provide a “good deal” for investors.Last week, David Norman, former chief executive of Credit Suisse Asset Management, launched TCF Fund Managers – which, he says, can translate as “Treating Customers Fairly” – in a bid to provide intermediaries with risk-rated “beta” products.He says: “I have been in the industry for years and have long believed customers are not getting a good deal from asset managers.“Prices keep going up; value seems to be going down.”The London-based firm will launch its own range of four funds of ETFs in the next few months. The range will arrive alongside management services which include the due diligence of the underlying exchange traded funds, institutional passive funds and futures.As part of the boutique’s development, Mr Norman plans to make further hires within distribution and fund research. The firm – which employs some 20 people, including outsource suppliers – will also hire staff within its investment committee to research and screen beta products.TCF is also looking to invest further in oversight and compliance.Mr Norman left Credit Suisse in January last year after its UK fund unit was sold to Aberdeen. He set up TCF with Gary Mairs, previously deputy chief executive of Insight Investment, which was bought by BNY Mellon from Lloyds in August 2009.The boutique will primarily target UK advisers, but could develop into continental Europe. “We are a small focused business. We will start and build on a single product range and, if we get scale and demand, then certainly Ucits gives us the opportunity to passport very quickly,” says Mr Norman.The four funds of ETFs will be UK-based open-ended investment companies (Oeics) covering the whole risk-return spectrum from cautious to high risk and will be made available via platforms. TCF believes there is demand for risk-rated multi-asset products. “We are responding to that need in a low-cost manner,” adds Mr Norman.In order to keep costs down, Mr Norman says TCF does not have “great big City offices”. The firm, which offers a one-stop-shop for advisers planning their own fund ranges, aims to be able to significantly reduce technology costs. “You’ll be able to use the benefit of our scale. We’ll be an institutional buyer of mutual funds or passive vehicles.”No details about seed capital were disclosed.Other passive competitors for mutual funds could soon be launched. According to Peter Robertson, head of retail services at Vanguard UK, “a number of people” have expressed an interest in the idea of developing asset-allocation-type funds based on low-cost passive products.“There are going to be more of them coming through,” adds Justin Urquhart Stewart, managing director at Seven Investment Management, which launched a similar ETF mutual fund 20 months ago.“ETFs in Britain have been slow to take off. ETFs arrived in the UK in the late 1990s, but a lot of IFAs didn’t know about them because they didn’t pay commission,” says Mr Urquhart Stewart.With the looming introduction of the retail distribution review – which is expected to ban commissions – advisers are becoming interested in non-commission products.TCF aims to capitalise on this growing market. It will provide ETF access and selection for intermediaries who do not have the willingness or the time to do it with due care. ETFs are securities that involve systems “not every intermediary has”, adds Mr Norman.The boutique says it has not finished testing its charging structure, but adds the total expense ratio, including transaction costs, will be cheaper than 100 basis points.Mr Urquhart Stewart says his firm’s fund, Asset Allocated Passive, has a 50 basis points annual charge, while the TER can reach 1.5 per cent.However, such new products may be accused of trying to add costs to a relatively cheap structure. Mr Robertson says: “I am sure many advisers can [choose beta products] themselves.“On the other hand, it depends what they are doing as advisers. If it is more to do with cash flows, analysis and planning rather than investments, then having a set of pre-determined funds is a reasonable thing for them.”Baptiste Aboulian is associate editor of Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared"
542;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-01-11T21:02:13Z;Pay-outs at rescued banks face fresh scrutiny;;Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney-general, raised the political heat on Wall Street pay on Monday, asking the top US financial institutions that received billions of dollars in public bail-out money for detailed information on bonuses.The requests to the eight banks, the initial recipients of funds from the troubled asset relief programme, are part of a broader inquiry into banks’ compensation policies, which remains a controversial issue.The eight groups – Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo – have all repaid the Tarp funds.Their compensation practices remain under the spotlight, however, because the US financial sector has recovered from the crisis much more quickly than expected and is on course to record billions of dollars in profits. The fourth-quarter reporting season kicks off on Friday with JPMorgan.The request for information on bonuses, which mirrors a similar move made by Mr Cuomo last year, would give him powerful ammunition to “name and shame” banks deemed to have doled out too much money to employees.The banks have until February 8 to provide the data.In the letters, Mr Cuomo asked for information on bonus pools, how they were being allocated and distributed, the breakdown of cash and stock in the rewards, and descriptions of any “claw-back” provisions or any other mechanisms tying pay to performance.Mr Cuomo also asked how the bonus pool would have been affected if the lenders had not received Tarp funding and how much and at what rate they have been lending to consumers and businesses over the past three years. “Many of these banks would not be in the position they are in today if it had not been for the Tarp money,” Mr Cuomo said on Monday. “The banks made a lot of money in some cases only because the taxpayers gave them a lot of money …There are institutions that would have failed if not for the taxpayer.”Banks already disclose the compensation of top executives but Mr Cuomo wants detailed data on other highly paid employees, including star bankers and traders who often earn million-dollar bonuses.Mr Cuomo said bonuses were an effective management tool when based on standards encouraging long-term sustainable growth, “not based on incentives that brought this nation to its knees” or “fictional” short-term profits. “Average Americans are still paying the price for the economic debacle,” he said.Mr Cuomo said he also wanted lenders to identify all compensation consultants they used “ to advise them on what were adequate and fair bonus payments… .. I’m curious to see if that practice has been going on,” he said.BofA said it had yet to receive the letter but would provide a response. The other banks declined to comment or could not be reached.Bonus compliance survey at www.ft.com/globaleconomy
543;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2010-01-11T19:42:50Z;Invista in talks over sale;;Invista Real Estate, the asset manager majority owned by Lloyds Banking Group, is in talks over a sale in the latest sign of consolidation in the property fund management sector.The company on Monday revealed it was in talks with an undisclosed third party in response to a sharp rise in its share price. The talks were “at a highly preliminary stage, and there can be no certainty that any offer will be made”.Invista spoke to several parties towards the end of last year, including Aberdeen Asset Management, Henderson Global Investors and Brookfield, the Canadian asset manager, but it is not thought the talks led to any concrete offer.There have been rumours that Invista would see a change in its ownership structure given the 55 per cent stake owned by Lloyds, which inherited its holding through the acquisition of HBOS.Lloyds has been selling similar non-core businesses. In August, Bank of New York Mellon agreed to pay £235m for Insight Asset Management’s £80bn of liability-driven investments.The next biggest shareholder in Invista is Wellcome Trust, which owns 24 per cent. There has also been talk of a buy-out by the management team led by Duncan Owen. JPMorgan Cazenove is advising Invista.Shares in Invista closed up 10½p at 61p.Any offer would be part of a wider consolidation in the European sector. Buying asset management businesses is seen as a relatively cheap way of expanding assets under management, particularly given the slump that has cut the price of many businesses.Internos Real Investors acquired GPT Halverton, a European property fund manager with €1.7bn (£1.5bn) of gross assets, for just €2 late last year owing to the fact that GPT, an Australian real estate investment trust, wanted to leave the region.Internos had faced competition from other UK fund managers that wanted to expand. They included Palmer Capital Partners, which took control of two funds from administration this year – Sir John Beckwith’s Alpha Real Capital and Protego Real Estate, which was itself acquired by Cornerstone, the US fund manager, last month.Aberdeen and Henderson, two of the interested parties in Invista, have been active in expanding through acquisition.Those close to Aberdeen point out that buying Invista would be difficult since just last week it announced an £87m deal to buy contracts to manage £13.5bn of assets from Royal Bank of Scotland.
544;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;China banks eclipse US rivals;;Chinese banks have cemented their position as the most highly valued financial institutions, taking four of the top five slots in a ranking of banks’ share prices as a multiple of their book values.China Merchants Bank, China Citic, ICBC and China Construction Bank lead the table, followed by Itaú Unibanco of Brazil, all with a price-to-book multiple of more than three. Over the past six years, the average price-to-book value of the biggest 50 banks has halved from two to one.This means that investors believe the average bank is worth no more than the value of its balance sheet. Most western banks are trading at well below their book value. But investors are attaching a growing premium to emerging markets banks, led by China Merchants, the most highly rated of the biggest 50 banks by market capitalisation, on a multiple of 4.3, according to Bloomberg data. At the start of the last decade, the US dominated the rankings. The top five were Bank of New York Mellon, Lloyds of the UK, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Only last year US Bancorp topped the table and Wells Fargo was in the top 10. The changes, which have seen the top-rated Chinese banks double in valuation over the past year as western rivals have been derated, reflect growing confidence in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil.They indicate concerns about the profitability of western institutions stemming from toxic assets and the drive to force banks to increase capital and liquid funds. Even western investment banks that have thrived over the past year have been left behind in the price-to-book league table. Goldman Sachs is ranked 22nd and JPMorgan 31st. “Western markets generally are experiencing their worst prospects for 20 years, and that’s in the valuations,” Robert Law, banks analyst at Nomura, said.“China in particular is a region that is perceived as less vulnerable to global downturn.” Although Chinese bank valuations were hit by investor nervousness in 2008, the limited fallout they suffered – combined with positively received government stimulus measures – have allowed them to bounce back.Some fringe developed economies with a reputation for tough regulatory controls and limited direct or indirect exposure to the subprime problem at the root of the crisis have benefited.Canadian and Australian banks in particular climbed the price-to-book rankings.
545;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-12-17T20:22:19Z;New BofA chief assures bank will not relocate;;Brian Moynihan has put to rest fears that the bank’s headquarters would shift from Charlotte, North Carolina, to New York.The pledge by Mr Moynihan, a 50-year-old insider, to preserve Charlotte’s place on the global financial map was a factor in the board’s decision to promote him to chief executive. Mr Moynihan declined to say whether he would move to Charlotte, since he has children going to school in the Boston area, but a person familiar with his thinking says he almost certainly will, even if it takes time for his family to follow.The issue of geography is important to Bank of America, which was known as NationsBank before its 1998 merger with San Francisco-based Bank of America.As recently as last week, BofA’s board was in serious discussions with Robert Kelly, Bank of New York Mellon chief executive, about the top job. Those discussions faltered around a number of issues, including money and chemistry. But a person familiar with the board’s deliberations said another concern was that Mr Kelly wanted to move the bank’s headquarters to New York.When he takes over in two weeks, Mr Moynihan faces a raft of challenges, business and regulatory, but they are similar to the ones that confronted his predecessor Ken Lewis, who became chief in 2001.Like Mr Lewis, Mr Moynihan will inherit a company that is digesting a series of huge acquisitions, in this case, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide. While both acquisitions have generated revenue for the bank this year, the projected savings that were advertised when the deals were announced have yet to be fully realised.Mr Moynihan will also have to weather a pair of regulatory investigations that threaten to embarrass members of BofA’s current management.Andrew Cuomo, attorney-general of New York, is close to deciding whether to bring charges against top BofA executives, including Mr Lewis and chief financial officer Joe Price, over the question of disclosures to the bank’s shareholders prior to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.BofA also faces a legal challenge from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has brought charges against the bank for lack of disclosure concerning the Merrill deal.That case is scheduled to go to trial in March.
546;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-12-15T23:22:11Z;Worries over Greece add to investors’ caution;Stock markets struggle to make headway as activity begins to tail off;Uncertainty was the watchword in financial markets on Tuesday as concerns increased over Europe’s banking sector and economic releases on both sides of the Atlantic unsettled investors.Heightening the mood of caution was the conclusion today of a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting.Greece remained at the forefront of many investors’ minds after a pledge by the country’s prime minister to cut the budget deficit failed to soothe concerns about its debt burden.“Whether or not a debt crisis can be avoided in Greece remains to be seen, but the whole affair has once more raised questions about the political and structural mechanisms of the eurozone,” said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.Hans-Werner Sinn, president of Germany’s Ifo economic institute, highlighted the sense of fear as he reportedly said that Greece was too small to break the eurozone apart, but added: “It could be the next Lehman Brothers.”The yield on the 10-year Greek government bond rose 28 basis points to 5.75 per cent, the highest level since April. Its spread over equivalent German Bunds widened 25bp to 254bp.On top of the worries over Greece, Austrian banks also came under the spotlight after Monday’s nationalisation of Hypo Group Alpe Adria, the country’s sixth biggest lender by assets.The move prompted talk that bigger rival Volksbanken was in trouble – speculation that was denied by Austria’s central bank.In the currency markets, concerns over the outlook for eurozone banks were heightened by disappointing Zew investor confidence data, and the euro struck a 10-week low against the dollar. Haven buying also sent the dollar sharply higher against the yen.The extent of the worries was further underlined by steep falls for the Swedish krona as investors fretted over the country’s exposure to the Baltic states.But the generally cautious mood in the markets was not reflected in US government bond prices as surprisingly robust producer price data stoked inflation fears ahead of the Fed rate announcement.The headline PPI jumped 1.8 per cent last month, largely due to big increases in energy, after a 0.3 per cent rise in October.But Paul Dales at Capital Economics said a large amount of spare capacity in the US industrial sector would continue to bear down on price pressures for some time yet.“Producer price inflation will probably rise further in December,” he said. “But with crude oil prices falling back, these gains should prove temporary.”Bond investors were less sanguine, however, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose 6bp at 3.62 per cent, the highest level since August, before falling back to 3.59 per cent.Gilt prices also fell back after UK consumer price inflation came in higher than expected in November. The yield gap between 10-year Gilts and Bunds briefly touched a one-year high of 68bp.Global equity markets struggled to gain traction. As well as the worrying US inflation data, Wall Street was unsettled by a weak December manufacturing report for the New York region. The S&P 500 closed off 0.6 per cent from Monday’s 2009 high.The Vix index of US equity volatility, a gauge of investor risk aversion, was up 1.7 per cent at 21.51, against a 2009 low of 20.05 struck last month.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index finished a fraction higher – its fourth successive advance – while Greek shares fell 2.1 per cent.The mood in Asia was broadly negative after a positive performance on Monday on the back of relief over the bail-out of Dubai.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2 per cent while Hong Kong fell 1.2 per cent and Shanghai 0.9 per cent.In commodities, gold declined but bounced well off early lows as the robust US inflation figures outweighed the impact from the firmer tone of the dollar.The metal, which was trading at $1,123 a troy ounce, has fallen 8 per cent from a recent record above $1,226.Oil also defied the strong dollar, with US crude climbing back above $70 a barrel, although copper eased back amid demand concerns.
547;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-12-15T01:36:23Z;BofA CEO search takes another detour;;Bank of America’s search for a new chief executive took another detour on Monday when one of the leading candidates, Robert Kelly, chief executive of BNY Mellon, said he was not leaving his current position.In an internal e-mail distributed to his employees on Monday, Mr Kelly wrote: “As you may know, I was approached by another bank as part of their CEO search process. It’s not an opportunity that I sought. After talking with them, I firmly concluded that my place is here at BNY Mellon.”Mr Kelly’s announcement restored stability to the management ranks of BNY Mellon, less than a week after he disclosed to his board of directors that he had been discussing the possibility of taking the position of chief executive at BofA.BofA has been searching for a new chief executive since Ken Lewis announced on September 30 that he intended to retire at the end of the year. With Mr Kelly now out of the picture, it is increasingly likely that the bank will turn to one of two internal candidates in the running for the job: Greg Curl, chief risk officer, or Brian Moynihan, head of BofA’s retail operations.This is the second time Mr Kelly has rebuffed BofA’s advances. He was approached by the bank’s board in October, say people familiar with the matter, but the discussions went nowhere owing to constraints on compensation that have been imposed on banks that received funds from the troubled asset relief programme.This month, BofA paid back $45bn in Tarp funds, freeing itself from the most onerous pay restrictions imposed by the US Treasury department. About the time of the Tarp repayment last week, Mr Kelly informed his board that BofA had initiated contact with him once again and that he was in discussions with the bank, which is based in North Carolina.In spite of the removal of formal pay restraints, negotiations with Mr Kelly are believed to have been derailed by compensation issues. The Obama administration has said it thinks that pay packages for bank chief executives are too big. Neither BofA nor Mr Kelly wanted to be part of a compensation deal that would expose both parties to public anger, says a source familiar with the matter.A BNY Mellon spokesman said compensation was ”at the bottom of the list” of reasons why Mr Kelly spurned BofA’s latest advance.BofA’s senior management, which has been loyal to Mr Lewis, favours one of the two insider candidates for the job. Institutional investors, as well as a significant number of rank-and-file employees, would like to see an outside candidate take the job. Federal regulators are also believed to favour an outsider.
548;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;View of Day: Sterling under renewed pressure;;Sterling could find itself under renewed pressure if the events of Dubai last week prompt investors to reassess their holdings of sovereign debt, says Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He notes that the recent deterioration in the UK’s public finances has led to fears that, out of all the industrialised nations, Britain is most at risk of losing its triple A status.Mr Derrick also points out that according to official figures, foreigners now own around 30 per cent of outstanding UK government debt.And he says the real shock from last week was that the situation at Dubai World had been allowed to get so far. “Thus, it seems reasonable to suppose that investors will embark on a broad reassessment of their debt holdings, in particular those nations with known issues. Within Europe, this means the likes of Ireland, Greece, Spain and the UK.“But as was made clear earlier this year, there is an implicit guarantee for members of the eurozone that find themselves in trouble that the other nations will stand by them. The same cannot be said for the UK.“As such, international investors are likely to prove more cautious in their assessment of the UK’s fiscal position than of its European neighbours.“Given the important role that foreign investors have played in helping to fund the UK’s fiscal deficit in recent years, the risk is that reassessment begins to bring fresh pressure to bear upon the pound.”
549;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-11-12T01:03:08Z;Struggle to find successor for Lewis at BofA;;"Bank of America might not meet the goal of naming a chief executive by Thanksgiving, reflecting a process that has been hobbled by the lack of a clear frontrunner and concerns that the process must pass muster with the Federal Reserve.BofA’s board is still vetting internal and external candidates to replace Ken Lewis, who is set to leave the bank on December 31.After Mr Lewis’s surprise announcement on September 30 that he would step down at the end of the year, insiders predicted a new chief executive, most likely from the ranks of BofA’s management, would be named by the end of October. The date was extended to Thanksgiving, the US holiday celebrated on November 26 this year.The delay highlights the surprise delivered to BofA’s board by Mr Lewis’s resignation, as well as difficulties faced since an April meeting, when investors voted to strip Mr Lewis of his title as chairman.After that meeting, the chairman’s title was turned over to Walter Massey, president emeritus of Morehouse College.At the recommendation of the Fed, which is monitoring the $45bn in taxpayer funds that propped up the bank this year, BofA’s board rid itself of nine directors who had little or no banking expertise and added six new directors, five of whom have spent their careers in finance.The 15-member board hardly had time to gel when Mr Lewis, frustrated with regulatory probes of his conduct during the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and with a boardroom that challenged his initiatives, announced his resignation.In early October, Mr Lewis expressed a preference to be succeeded by Greg Curl, the bank’s chief risk officer. However, Mr Massey, heeding pressure from regulators at the Fed, insisted on conducting what one insider describes as a “robust” search for internal and external candidates.The other top internal candidate is Brian Moynihan, who has been in charge of BofA’s retail banking since August.Among the outside candidates to have been contacted, but who have not necessarily expressed interest, are Robert Kelly, chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon; Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays Capital; Charles Scharf, head of retail banking at JPMorgan Chase; and Michael O’Neill, board member of Citigroup and a former executive at Bank-America, which merged with NationsBank in 1998 to form Bank of America.According to a person familiar with the process, at least one candidate has been put off by the notion that he would become chief executive but not chairman."
550;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-29T23:08:51Z;US cheer weighs on dollar;;The dollar slid sharply on Thursday after data showed the US economy emerged from technical recession in the third quarter.The US government’s advance estimate showed gross domestic product grew at an annualised rate of 3.5 per cent in the third quarter. It was the first rise since the second quarter of 2008 and beat expectations of a 3.2 per cent increase.The news boosted equities and risk appetite, reducing haven demand for both the US dollar and the yen.Analysts said the figures were a near-perfect combination for assets perceived as risky: strong enough to encourage those with an optimistic outlook on the financial markets, but not too strong to generate expectations of accelerated monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve.By late trade in New York, the dollar had lost 0.9 per cent to $1.4836 against the euro, slid 1 per cent to $1.6536 against the pound and was down 0.8 per cent to SFr1.0186 against the Swiss franc. The yen fared worse, down 0.9 per cent to Y91.54 against the dollar.Both the dollar and the yen had rallied strongly ahead of the report.Analysts said the price action following the GDP figures suggested both currencies’ strength earlier in the week was caused by investors unwinding carry trades – in which low-yielding units such as the dollar and yen are sold to fund the purchase of higher-yielding assets elsewhere – on fears that US growth would disappoint.“With third-quarter US GDP living up to its billing, players are returning to the carry trade again, driving the dollar and the yen decidedly lower,” said Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon.Meanwhile, commodity-linked currencies, which have been hit hard this week by rising risk aversion, staged a rally.The Australian dollar climbed 2.2 per cent to $0.9166 against the US dollar, while the Norwegian krone gained 1.8 per cent to NKr5.6417 and the Canadian dollar rose 1.3 per cent to C$1.0669.The New Zealand dollar also advanced, climbing 1.7 per cent to $0.7334.Earlier in the session, the New Zealand dollar fell to a three-week low of $0.7158 against the dollar after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand struck a more dovish tone than expected in the statement following its policy meeting.The RBNZ, as expected, left interest rates on hold at 2.5 per cent and showed little sign it was about to join its counterparts in Australia and Norway and start tightening monetary policy.“While dropping its formal bias towards monetary easing, the statement stopped well short of signalling any rate hikes in the near term as markets had grown to fear,” said Christian Lawrence at RBC Capital Markets.
551;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-29T00:02:50Z;Globe pub group on brink of administration;;Globe Pub Company, the ailing pub operator owned by property entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz, was on the brink of being put into administrative receivership on Wednesday night.The Bank of New York Mellon, which became the trustee to Globe’s bondholders after the pub group defaulted on a £257m asset-backed loan in April, has lined up Zolfo Cooper as receivers to the business.An appointment of the firm could be announced as early as Thursday, according to people familiar with the matter.Such a move would lead to Globe, which owns 421 tenanted pubs, being sold to a new vehicle backed by Heineken. The Dutch brewer could pay £180m to buy the assets, one person familiar with the matter said.Mr Tchenguiz’s R20 investment vehicle is expected to take a controlling stake in the new business of just over 50 per cent, the person added.Heineken, BoNY and Zolfo all declined to comment last night. Mr Tchenguiz could not be reached for comment.The move comes after Heineken moved to snap up a big chunk of Globe debt to become the group’s controlling creditor earlier this year and would free the brewer from the onerous beer supply agreement it has with Globe.Although Globe is owned by Mr Tchenguiz, Heineken has a 30-year contract to manage and supply beer to its estate through its Scottish & Newcastle subsidiary. However, under the terms of the highly unusual agreement, if Globe hits financial difficulty, payments due to bondholders and lenders will have priority over payments to S&N, even though Heineken would still be contractually obliged to continue supplying beer and managing the estate.This is a situation Heineken has found itself in – managing and supplying beer to Globe without receiving any payment – since Globe breached its banking covenants and then slipped into default this year.Mr Tchenguiz has suffered setbacks in the pub sector before. Last March, he was forced to resort to administration to restructure Laurel Pub Company, a separate managed pub and restaurant business, and in October he had to sell a 25 per cent stake in Mitchells & Butlers, the All Bar One operator, at a huge loss.Globe, which was created four years ago after Mr Tchenguiz, through his R20 investment vehicle, acquired 360 pubs from Spirit for £345m, has been hit by the smoking ban in pubs, the recession, soaring beer duty and cheap drinks in supermarkets.The estate is largely made up of smaller pubs – which are worst affected when trade slows. In the three months to the end of August, beer sales fell by a further 8 per cent year-on-year.Globe reported a first-quarter loss of more than £200m after being forced to write down the value of its estate amid continued poor trading.
552;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-22T19:12:12Z;Russia drops $22.5bn BoNY Mellon lawsuit;;Russia dropped a $22.5bn lawsuit against the Bank of New York Mellon on Thursday after agreeing an out-of-court settlement with the company in a case related to a decade-old money laundering scandal.A judge in Moscow’s arbitration court said Russia’s federal customs service, the plaintiff, had ordered the case to be closed, Interfax reported.The case stems from a scandal 10 years ago when two Russian émigrés, one a vice-president of the Bank of New York, admitted helping to wire $7bn out of Russia illegally through accounts at the bank. The bank was never charged with wrongdoing.Russia’s customs service resurrected the case in 2008 invoking Rico, a US anti-racketeering law, in Moscow’s arbitration court to claim billions of dollars of damages for unpaid taxes on the money.The case, seen as a test of whether Rico laws are applicable outside the US, has thrown a spotlight on Russian president Dmitry Medvedev’s pledge to eliminate what he calls “legal nihilism” in Russia.BNY Mellon has agreed without admission of liability to pay $14m to cover the trial costs – the same amount paid by the bank to the US in 2005 under a non-prosecution case related to the money laundering scandal. It has also agreed to open a trade finance line with Russian banks renew-able every 180 days for an aggregate amount of $4bn over five years.Matthew Biben, executive vice-president and deputy general counsel of BNY Mellon, said, “Now the impediment of the case is behind us we look forward to expanding relations with our existing customers.”Throughout its passage through the courts, the lawsuit has been repeatedly adjourned raising concern among investors about the rule of law in Russia.Signs that the dispute was drawing to a close came last month when Alexei Kudrin, the Russian finance minister, told parliament the customs service had been unable to gather sufficient evidence to support its case.Russia’s customs service and BNY Mellon issued a joint statement on Thursday saying they were pleased the dispute was resolved.Andrey Belyaninov, the head of the Russian customs service, said the case was “an example of the increased vigilance of the Russian Federation in international financial markets”.Mr Biben said the settlement was “a commonsense resolution that benefits our company, our employees, shareholders and customers.”
553;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-22T18:42:47Z;Russia v Bank of New York;;Reason can sometimes prevail in the through-the-looking-glass world of Russian justice. Investors will draw some comfort from the withdrawal of a lawsuit by Russia’s federal customs service that sought $22.5bn of damages from Bank of New York Mellon. The suit was linked to a decade-old case, already resolved in the US, involving $7bn of illegal transfers out of Russia. Following the deal between Norway’s Telenor and Russia’s Alfa Group, it removes the last of two disputes whose odour had hung over Russia’s investment environment like rotting fish.The faintly surreal case saw Russian customs employ Miami lawyers, better known for representing air crash victims, to apply US anti-racketeering statutes in a Moscow court. It was a test of President Dmitry Medvedev’s pledges to bolster the Russian judiciary’s independence, and whether a western company could get a fair hearing against a state body. In spite of BoNY’s insistence that the suit was without merit and any judgment unenforceable, the potential damages raised questions about whether it needed a reserve against a loss.In the event, the judge encouraged the two sides to settle. BoNY is still stung for $14m legal costs, but after Russian customs reportedly pressed for a $1bn settlement, that is the best it could have hoped for. It may also be a sign Russian authorities recognised the potential damage to Russia’s investment image. Sadly, investors can have little confidence that similar challenges will not recur. France’s Carrefour quit Russia last week after only a few months – perhaps eyeing the travails of Renault facing an ultimatum to invest more in tottering carmaker Avtovaz or see its stake diluted. A threat-free period might help foreign direct investment recover. But Russia, suffering a brutal recession, needs investment now.Russia has dropped a $22.5 billion lawsuit against Bank of New York Mellon, a judge said on Thursday, in another sign of a thaw in Russia-U.S. ties after the stormy years experienced during George W. Bush’s presidency, Reuters reports.Russia had sought compensation from the bank after its former vice-president, Lucy Edwards, helped illegally transfer $7 bn out of the country in the late 1990s through Bank of New York accounts.”The court has examined the Customs Service’s request to withdraw the case against the Bank of New York Mellon and the case is closed,” judge Lyudmila Pulova said.Bank of New York Mellon has agreed to pay the Customs Service $14m in legal fees and open a trade finance credit facility for Russian banks, renewable every 180 days and totalling $4 billion over five years.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
554;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-16T13:41:42Z;Lloyds sells Halifax estate agents for £1;;Lloyds Banking Group said on Friday that it had agreed in principle to sell its loss-making Halifax Estate Agencies arm to LSL Property Services for £1.The disposal will lead to Lloyds shutting the 121 Halifax banking counters currently located inside the estate agency chain’s branches, with up to 460 people losing their jobs as a consequence.HEA is the UK’s fourth-biggest network of estate agencies, with 218 branches. In 2008, it made a pre-tax loss of £2m as the volume of residential property sales dried up, compared with a £34m profit in 2007.Lloyds came to own the business when it bought HBOS in a controversial deal that was completed earlier this year.On Friday, Lloyds said in a statement that the sale agreement followed a strategic review by the bank “which concluded that an estate agency operation is no longer integral to its business model”.The disposal follows the announcement of a similar post-deal housekeeping measure in August, when Lloyds said it was selling its Insight asset management business to Bank of New York Mellon for £235m.Lloyds is also expected to be required to make significant disposals to win approval from the European Commission for aid from the UK government.LSL, which owns the Your Move, Reeds Rains and InterCounty estate agency brands, said the purchase of HEA would make it the second-biggest network of estate agencies in the UK by number of outlets, with 584 branches.In a statement, it suggested that HEA had been run primarily as a way of distributing financial services products, and therefore had unrealised potential.“This is a significant opportunity for LSL to acquire a high-quality branch network, an established asset management business and pipeline of sales on favourable commercial terms at a low point in the economic cycle.”LSL shares rose 5.7 per cent to 277p in afternoon trading on Friday. Lloyds shares rose 2.4 per cent to 93.65p.As part of the deal, which is expected to complete in January 2010, 1,050 HEA staff will transfer to LSL.LSL also issued a trading statement on Friday, in which it said that the business had been trading ahead of management expectations since the start of July, although turnover for the 8 months ended August 31 was down by 18 per cent.It said it remained cautious about the outlook for 2010, declaring that “any recovery is likely to be constrained by the availability of mortgage credit and general economic backdrop”.
555;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-14T21:43:48Z;Dollar loses further ground;;The dollar lost ground again on Wednesday as stock markets rallied.In the six months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, the dollar was a haven from equity market losses and turbulent trading conditions. But as equity markets and risk appetite have recovered, the dollar has been on the decline.A session of well-received data on Wednesday included better-than-expected earnings from Intel and JPMorgan, which drove equity indices in the US and Europe to year highs , improving trade conditions in China and forecast-beating retail sales in the US.However, minutes from the Federal Reserve’s policy-setting meeting in September strengthened the views that official rates would stay low for some time, with the committee saying “the costs of growth turning out to be weaker than anticipated could be relatively high’’.The US currency was down 0.3 per cent versus sterling to $1.5973, off 0.4 per cent at $1.4914 against the euro and 0.34 per cent lower against the yen at Y89.41, as some analysts began to rethink the Federal Reserve’s likely monetary policy strategy.“Consumer and investment sentiment have moved back towards historical norms,” said Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon.“The US economy is in the process of recovery and once non-farm payrolls move back into positive territory, the Fed will begin normalising interest rates. With the dollar in a downward spiral, the Fed may well act sooner rather than later, and faster rather than slower.”Chinese trade data showed an improvement, as the rate of export decline slowed from -23.4 per cent in August to -15.2 per cent in September. With imports also improving, the news indicated a rebound in demand.“As the global economy rebounds, encouraging further capital outflows into high beta emerging market economies, it is becoming increasingly difficult to envisage a reversal of the current trend,” said Lee Hardman at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ.The Australian dollar climbed 0.66 per cent to $0.9148 against its US counterpart, the Norwegian krone added 1.11 per cent to NKr5.5504, and the Brazilian real gained 1.05 per cent to R$1.7035.Brazil’s central bank, which has bought more than $14bn since May to prevent disorderly appreciation in the real, offered to make further purchases on Wednesday.Sterling enjoyed some brief respite from its decline after the UK jobless claimant count rose less than expected in September. In early trade it climbed nearly 0.5 per cent against the euro, but later slid to £0.9337, down 0.07 per cent.
556;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-14T14:42:30Z;US retail sales slump on post-‘clunker’ weakness;;US retail sales fell at the fastest rate this year in September as the expiration of the cash-for-clunkers rebate programme stalled the car buying frenzy.Separately on Wednesday, official figures showed that businesses kept shedding inventories in August as they continue to cope with diminished consumer demand.Sales fell by 1.5 per cent last month to $344.7bn, commerce department figures showed on Wednesday. In spite of the drop, the data was better than economists expected and sectors beyond the car market indicated consumers were showing signs of life.Compared with a year ago, retail sales remain depressed, down by 5.7 per cent.Car dealers saw sales plunge by 11.8 per cent from August to September after climbing by 8.8 per cent the previous month. However, excluding cars, retail sales were up by 0.5 per cent.“The US consumer remains crucial to the fortunes of both the US and global economy and the latest numbers are therefore another important source of encouragement,” said Alan Ruskin, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Most sectors notched monthly gains in September, led by furniture, grocery and department stores. Health and personal care stores and sporting goods also fared well last month and sales at petrol stations increased.“While continued fiscal and monetary stimulus is still necessary for private demand to recover on a sustained basis, the consumer appears to be spending money again going into the holiday shopping season,” said Michael Woolfolk, a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.Weakness in the housing market continued to slow sales of building materials and garden equipment, which slumped by 0.2 per cent. In the last year, sales of those items have fallen by 13 per cent.Economists are looking for a return of consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of economic activity in the US, to help overpower the hangover from recession. John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, of RDQ Economics, project that consumer spending will rise at an annual rate of 3.25 per cent in the third quarter, lowering the savings rate to 5 per cent.Last week US retailers reported their first monthly sales gain since the financial collapse of September 2008, although most still saw lower sales than a year ago as shoppers remained focused on bargain hunting.Meanwhile, business inventories fell by 1.5 per cent in August and were down by 13.3 per cent year-on-year. The monthly drop was fuelled by a 2.3 per cent decline at retailers, which benefited from the tail-end of the clunkers scheme.
557;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-08T20:02:52Z;Asia steps in to slow dollar’s fall;;Asian central banks intervened heavily in the currency markets on Thursday to stem the appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar amid fears that their exports could be losing ground against China.The mainly south-east Asian countries have been spurred to defend the competitiveness of their currencies by China’s decision to in effect re-peg the renminbi to the dollar since July last year.Simon Derrick, at Bank of New York Mellon in London, said: “Other Asian central banks outside China are naturally looking to aggressively defend their competitive edge against undesirable currency strength as the dollar weakens.”After allowing the renminbi to appreciate by about 20 per cent against the US dollar from mid-2005, Beijing re-pegged its currency to the greenback when export growth contracted.The greenback hit one-year lows against a raft of regional currencies. The dollar index, which tracks its value against a basket of six main currencies, hit a 14-month low in afternoon trading in New York.Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, issued a warning about the euro’s strength on Thursday and said that authorities on both sides of the Atlantic would “co-operate as appropriate”.Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, said: “He clearly tried to signal as convincingly as possible that the eurozone and the US are united in the desire to limit the rise in the euro versus the dollar – but the market is calling his bluff.”Gold prices hit an all-time high for the third day in a row, on the dollar’s weakness. Metals such as aluminium and copper jumped 4 per cent, while crude oil surged almost $3 to more than $70 a barrel.The central banks identified by traders as substantial buyers of US dollars included Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan. Hong Kong and Singapore, which both have managed currency regimes, were also buyers.The moves to limit Asian currency appreciation provide ammunition for those who warn that the new Group of 20 framework for strong and balanced growth is toothless. Less than a week after the world’s finance ministers and central bankers agreed to foster more balanced world economic growth in Istanbul, Asian officials have intervened to prevent exchange rates playing their part in the process. However, traders said that the central bank interventions appeared to be aimed at controlling the pace at which the US dollar declined rather than solely to stop Asian currencies appreciating.The Obama administration has not altered its refrain that it believes in a “strong dollar” but is seen as unlikely to intervene in currency markets, particularly as the US Treasury recognises the trade-weighted value is similar to where it was two years ago.Additional reporting by Ralph Atkins in Venice

559;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Financial sector: Prudence pays off for big banks;;Thanks to a mixture of regulatory skill and bankers’ luck, the core of Spain’s financial system was on the fringes of the global storm that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers and so escaped the worst of the direct damage.Unlike their peers in the US and the UK, Spanish banks were prevented by prudent regulators at the Bank of Spain from exposing themselves to the risks of exotic credit products supposedly kept off the balance sheet.They were also obliged to set aside counter-cyclical “generic” bad-loan provisions, which reduced their profits in years of high growth but now constitute a welcome cushion of reserves that is the envy of other European banks. They were in any case too busy making money out of lending to the domestic housing market boom to worry about competing with international investment banks.Spain was not immune to the global crisis, of course. As in other markets, the fund management, hedge fund and broking industries suffered a series of closures or cutbacks, accelerated by the $3bn-plus exposure of wealthy Spanish and Latin American investors to the fraud perpetrated by Bernard Madoff.Private equity firms found themselves unable to float, sell or refinance some of the leveraged companies bought in the high-growth years before the crash. Accountancy and law firms had to switch staff from the moribund mergers and acquisitions sector into newly busy debt restructuring.Spanish banks, particularly dependent on international wholesale financing, were forced to turn to the government and the European Central Bank for liquidity when the interbank and wholesale markets froze.But the bigger Spanish commercial banks – by virtue of their focus on retail banking and international diversification, primarily in Latin America – have emerged in a position of relative strength amid the post-crisis wreckage of some of their foreign competitors.Far from plunging into loss, they have continued generating substantial profits. Of the top five banks in the world measured by The Banker magazine in terms of 2008 pre-tax profits, three were Chinese and two – Santander and BBVA – were Spanish. Even in the first half of this year, their profits were only slightly dented, with Santander and BBVA making €4.5bn and €2.8bn of net profit respectively.“The Spanish financial system has no systemic risk despite having received almost no taxpayers’ money – unlike most financial systems in the world,” says Antonio Rodríguez-Pina, chairman in Spain of Deutsche Bank, which has a retail network as well as an investment banking operation.Spanish banks, even smaller ones, have emerged as predators – and rescuers – in foreign markets. Santander invested in the UK and the US in the wake of the crisis. BBVA and Banco Sabadell have added to their operations in the southern US, and Banco Popular is thinking of doing the same.“It’s a perfect opportunity to step into an environment where prices have tumbled,” says Fernando Alonso, Miami-based lead attorney at Hunton & Williams, the law firm that advised Banco Sabadell on the purchase of Mellon United National Bank from The Bank of New York Mellon.Spanish banks, like their foreign peers, are nevertheless under intense pressure to increase their capital strength following the crisis.Bankers in Spain complain that their reasonably robust capital ratios are unfairly compared with those of UK and other banks whose ratios are high only because they were recapitalised by governments.But they continue to raise capital at every opportunity. Santander is expected to benefit from the flotation of its Brazilian subsidiary in what will be one of the world’s largest initial public offerings this year.Banco Popular, with a 5 per cent market share in Spain, is raising more than €1bn through shares and convertible bonds to boost its core capital ratio from 7.4 to 8.6 per cent of assets.“We are moving very, very high,” says Jacobo González-Robatto, chief financial officer, “because we think that there are new standards coming and because we think that we have to have surplus capital.”The weak underbelly of the financial system is principally the cajas, un­listed, regionally based and often highly politicised savings and loans institutions that account for half the sector’s assets.They seized market share from commercial banks at the height of the property boom and now find themselves heavily exposed to the collapse of property developers and to the payment difficulties of mortgaged householders.One of them – Caja Castilla La Mancha – has already been bailed out and taken over by the Bank of Spain. The central bank and the government have launched a €9bn ($13bn) restructuring fund known as the Frob (the Fondo de Reestructuración Ordenada Bancaria), which can be leveraged up to €99bn and whose aim is to force a series of mergers of cajas.Spain, in short, is suffering a traditional, property-linked banking crisis, but it is one that has been exacerbated by the financing obstacles arising from the broader international crisis.In the words of a report by Santiago López Díaz, banking analyst at Credit Suisse: “It might get worse before it gets better.”He and other analysts believe that Spanish banks and cajas are underestimating the true extent of their bad loan problems in spite of the historically strict – but recently relaxed – provisioning requirements of the Bank of Spain.If there is any good news, it is that Spain has faced such banking crises before. “We confront a situation of changing cycles, and we know how to face these things,” says José María Arias Mosquera, chairman of Banco Pastor in the Galician port of A Coruña.“Our crisis is traditional, if you leave out the liquidity issue which is virtually resolved,” he says, recalling how Spanish banks avoided the US subprime mortgage fiasco that brought banks elsewhere to their knees.“When a financial institution faces enormous losses from subprime and now has to face a traditional crisis, then it is in a very weak position. That did not happen in Spain.”
560;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-10-02T21:27:07Z;Dollar and yen climb after weaker payrolls;;Currency markets were in thrall of economic data all week and the important releases – capped by Friday’s US non-farm payrolls– mostly disappointed, sending the dollar and yen higher.The payrolls data showed 263,000 jobs were lost in the US during September, contrasting sharply with the 175,000 average forecast.Meanwhile, the unemployment rate crept ever closer to 10 per cent, hitting 9.8 per cent, its highest level since 1983.“The data hamper any risk recovery after the recent sell-off,” said Alan Ruskin, of RBS Greenwich Capital. “This should play negative for risk currencies, notably commodity currencies, as this data with other numbers force money managers to recalibrate their views on the pace of global recovery.”This week’s manufacturing activity data as recorded by purchasing managers in the US, UK, Europe and Japan were also disappointing, failing to show steady, month-on-month progress.Analysts warned that the data show that the path to recovery is unlikely to be straight and that investors must overcome such disappointments along the way.Yet the dollar pared some of its gains on Friday. It remained 0.2 per cent higher on the day and over the week against sterling at $1.5924. The euro, however, after initial losses following the payroll report, recovered 0.6 per cent on Friday to stand 0.4 per cent lower on the week to $1.4627.“The implications of this price action are that the market bought dollars on negative US data and took profit as soon as their objective was reached,” said Michael Woolfolk, of Bank of New York Mellon.Instead, investors favoured the yen as their haven of choice. “The recent bout of weaker-than-expected US economic data has strengthened concerns about the strength of the global recovery outside of the Asian region, pulling equity markets lower and driving the yen higher across the board,” said Jane Foley, of Forex.com.Hirohisa Fujii, Japan’s new finance minister, caused confusion in foreign exchange markets this week after saying dollar-yen moves had not been “abnormal” and that “foreign exchange dumping” to defend his country’s exporters would be wrong.The minister had previously commented on the benefits to consumers of a strong yen, raising speculation that t the new government would not be likely to intervene in the market.This week’s comments sent the yen to an eight-month high of Y88.22 on Monday. Later clarification from Mr Fujii, in which he denied he was in favour of a strong yen, did little to cool appetite for the currency.Over the week, the yen was up 1.1 per cent against the dollar to Y88.63, gained 1.1 per cent to Y129.51 versus the euro and rallied 1.3 per cent to Y141.14 against the pound.Suspected intervention in the foreign exchange market by Swiss authorities on Wednesday drove the franc sharply lower against the euro on the day.But it had recovered much of its lost ground by Friday, standing 0.1 per cent lower at SFr1.5101.Although the Australian dollar remained flat at $0.8706 on the week, it surged 1.5 per cent on Wednesday. This followed robust retail sales data, which added to evidence that the country’s recovery was gaining pace.
561;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-23T16:17:44Z;Industry: No longer ‘hell with the lid off’;;When Roger Scarlett-Smith was first posted to Pittsburgh in the mid-1990s, his UK colleagues were quick to offer their condolences.“When I came out here, people in London felt it was like a [prison] sentence,” says the British-born president at GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical giant.His story is a familiar one.In corporate circles, Pittsburgh has long been known as a hub for large companies. But ever since the 19th-century author James Parton described the city as “hell with the lid off”, Pittsburgh has struggled to rid itself of its image as a cauldron of smoke-stack industries centred around steel.Even after that sector imploded in the 1970s and early 1980s and the city embarked on a tortuous path of economic diversification, the stereotype has stuck.The fact that Pittsburgh’s best-known brand is its American football team – the Steelers – has not helped to dispel the perception of it as a rust-belt town.“The visibility arising from the G20 meeting will be extremely important,” argues James Rohr, chief executive of PNC, a large bank headquartered in the city. “The most visible thing in Pittsburgh is the Steelers,” he says, before adding that “nobody” is thinking of changing the name of the Super Bowl champions.Not surprisingly, Pittsburgh’s public relations blitz in the run-up to the summit has focused on the city’s rise from the ashes of the steel industry to a new economy of high-tech industries and top universities. Yet, the oft-repeated tale of “eds and meds” does not paint a full picture.Pittsburgh’s transformation has been underpinned by sectors that 19th-century local denizens like Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Mellon, would recognise: manufacturing and financial services.Despite losing hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs two decades ago when the US steel industry was savaged by cheaper imports, inefficient production and a bloated cost base, Pittsburgh remains an industrial hub.Blessed with natural resources and waterways – it sits at the confluence of three rivers – as well as a strategic position between the east and west of the country, Pittsburgh is still an attractive location for industry.More than 100,000 people still work in manufacturing in the Pittsburgh region and many are still employed in metal production, according to official figures.But the smoky furnaces that polluted the rivers and clouded the sky have gone, replaced by sleeker, modern-looking plants.But many of the companies – big names such as US Steel, Alcoa and Westinghouse – have stayed, and have been joined by smaller, up-and-coming groups in the energy and biotech sectors.John Surma, chief executive of US Steel, which still employs 4,700 people in the area, argues that the sector’s devastating crisis forced its survivors to take radical action, something he regards as a testament to the flexibility of US capitalism: “It is like steel: anything can become anything else,” he says.The research centre set up by the aluminium giant Alcoa a short drive from the centre of town confirms that impression.Instead of plumes of smoke and metal-bashing equipment, visitors are greeted by manicured lawns, staff developing lightweight bus frames and solar panels, and a windowless facility for top-secret assignments for the government.Aside from manufacturing, and companies with strong allegiances to the city such as the food group Heinz and GSK, the other pillar of Pittsburgh’s corporate edifice is financial services.PNC and Bank of New York Mellon – two of the largest financial groups in the US – dominate the city’s financial landscape.And although the 2007 merger between Mellon Financial and Bank of New York saw Pittsburgh lose out to the Big Apple as the headquarters of the combined group, its executives say they will continue to add jobs in the area.Barrie Athol, who oversees the post-merger integration, says the high-level academic institutions, lower cost of living and the company’s scale in the region will ensure Pittsburgh remains a key centre for the company.“Why would I want to have a fund accountant in midtown Manhattan when I can have it here?” he says. “We do have other options around the country but the difference is that in Pittsburgh we have scale.”Still, not every corporate leader is an unabashed Pittsburgh-lover. One executive dismisses the city as “having New York’s attitude and hassles without the amenities”.And most business people complain about the lack of direct flights to the rest of the country and the world, a problem caused by the financial issues that beset US Airways in 2005 and forced it to abandon a pledge to turn Pittsburgh into one of its hubs.But even without a high-calibre airport, Pittsburgh has come a long way from the days when Aris Candris, now chief executive of Westinghouse, was a schoolboy in Greece: “My geography book had a picture of Pittsburgh in the middle of the day with the lights on: things are very different now,” he says.
562;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-16T23:08:17Z;Hedge funds forced to rethink customer base;;In September 2008 wealthy customers at a UK private bank were offered the alternative investment opportunity of the year: a chance to put money into a portfolio of five of Europe’s most-prominent activist hedge funds, including The Children’s Investment Fund, Atticus, Toscafund, Hermitage and Centaurus.The bank reasoned that activist strategies, which typically involve taking stakes in companies and lobbying their boards for change, were set to outperform. So much so that it offered its customers a significant margin: for every pound they invested, the bank would lend them another four.One year on and Atticus and Centaurus have announced the liquidation of their flagship funds. Toscafund, run by former Credit Lyonnaise banking analyst Martin Hughes, saw its leveraged investments in financials cause a staggering 67 per cent fall in its portfolio.Hermitage Capital, meanwhile, was the single largest investor in the Russian stock market, which in the fourth quarter of 2008 fell 45 per cent. Even TCI, the largest and best-known of the funds in the basket ended 2008 down 43 per cent.Those clients that took up the banks’ attractive offer, with leverage, now owe it more money than they invested.It is on the back of such experiences that high net worth individuals, via private banks and funds of funds, have been the single largest investor group to exit the hedge fund sector over the past 12 months.Bank of New York Mellon and the US consultancy Casey Quirk concluded in research this year that wealthy individuals had pulled $500bn from hedge funds since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, accounting for the bulk of the industry’s huge outflows.While many hedge funds say high net worth investors will also be the quickest to return to the industry, they are also planning for a longer-term shift.An increasing number of fund managers are focusing on how they can attract and keep investment from institutional investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, which manage huge pools of capital and are under increasing pressure to deliver higher returns.Institutions account for about 43 per cent of the money invested in hedge funds. But according to the research by BoNYM and Casey Quirk, this will rise to about two thirds by 2013, with pension funds alone set to allocate $252bn. Talk of “institutionalisation” is now commonplace. But the change is not necessarily being looked forward to.The industry is growing up and getting more “boring” according to one London manager: “Private banks and high net worth didn’t ask so many questions and didn’t tie up so much time with paperwork.”“More paperwork” is the starting point for a more dynamic, demanding and exacting relationship with clients that leaner, performance-driven hedge fund outfits are finding hard to embrace.Funds are facing longer periods of due diligence, greater demands on transparency and in some cases, even reviews of their underlying terms and fund structures. “The ‘I am a genius, give me your money and get lost’ days are over,” said one London hedge fund partner, from a firm that has courted institutional clients for the past few years. “You can’t just hire some asset manager from xyz investment bank and then expect money to come in.”The stiffest competition among funds for staff is nevertheless no longer simply for trading talent, but for relationship managers and salespeople.Several UK funds have specifically hired salespeople in New York, while US-funds that previously had little footprint in the UK and Europe, have begun to make inroads.One significant uncertainty for both is what the European market will look like in a few years time.The European Commission’s draft directive could cut off European institutions from alternative asset managers and withdraw a significant investor base from the global market, say its opponents.As many hedge funds are finding, it is increasingly client, and not just asset, management that counts.
563;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-15T17:49:30Z;Dollar becoming top carry trade currency;;For years, the yen was the currency of choice to fund international carry trades. But is the dollar starting to take its place?Analysts say negligible US interest rates, its quantitative easing measures and little sign that the country is set to withdraw from its ultra-loose monetary policy anytime soon leaves it in a similar position to Japan at the start of the decade.“This puts the dollar in exactly the same position as the yen back in 2001 and makes it naturally attractive as a carry trade funding currency,” says Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon. “The dollar is the new yen.”The carry trade strategy, in which low-yielding currencies are sold to finance the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets, was widely used in the years prior to the eruption of the financial crisis.The low-yielding yen, and to a lesser extent the Swiss franc, were the most widely used as funding currencies, pushing them down to multi-year lows against a raft of currencies as risk appetite was supported by an abundance of liquidity and rallying asset markets. Indeed, both currencies rallied sharply as turbulence on global markets erupted last autumn and forced investors to unwind their positions.But rather than lose their value as asset markets have shown renewed signs of strength and risk appetite has improved in recent weeks, both the yen and the Swiss franc have rallied against the dollar.Indeed, the dollar fell to a seven-month low of Y90.18 against the yen earlier this week and on Tuesday hit a one-year low of SFr1.0318 against the Swiss franc.The dollar has not just been weak against the yen and Swiss franc, however. After trading in a relatively narrow range over the summer months, the dollar was pushed out of its comfort zone last week, dropping to its lowest level for a year on a trade-weighted basis as trading volumes on the world’s currency markets moved higher.Some analysts point to a change in dynamic that has made the dollar a more attractive funding currency to explain its recent fall.While official US interest rates, such as those in Japan and Switzerland, are moored at levels close to zero, it is the rates on offer in the interbank market that are crucial in determining the profitability of carry trade strategies.Last month, three-month dollar Libor lending rates fell below those of the yen and last week dropped below those of the Swiss franc for the first time since November, effectively making the dollar the cheapest funding currency.Indeed, at just 30 basis points, three-month dollar lending rates are falling towards levels that led to two waves of yen-funded carry trades that weighed on the Japanese currency between 1996 and 1998, and then between 2001 and 2008.The usual explanation for dollar weakness over recent months has been an improvement in risk appetite.This weighs on the dollar as emboldened investors sell the currency to fund investments in higher-yielding assets elsewhere.But some analysts believe this fails to adequately explain the secular drop in the dollar in recent weeks.Indeed, Mitul Kotecha at Calyon says it is not clear that there was actually much further improvement in risk appetite last week.The S&P 500 recorded its biggest weekly gain since July and equity volatility also declined, but other indicators painted a different picture.Gold prices registered further gains above $1,000 a troy ounce. US Treasuries saw their strongest demand in almost two years for the $12bn 30-year note auction, while the earlier 10 year note auction also saw solid demand as well as strong interest from foreign investors.Thus it has been a shift in funding rather than increasing confidence that has weighed on the dollar.“A likely explanation for the drop in the dollar is that it is increasingly becoming a favoured funding currency, taking over the mantle from the yen,” says Mr Kotecha.He says this is likely to continue to put pressure on the dollar: “Ultra-low interest rates suggests that the dollar will remain under pressure for a while yet, especially as the Federal Reserve continues to highlight that US interest rates are not going to go up quickly.”Speculative positioning data seem to back up the shift against the dollar, revealing the extent of recent deterioration in dollar sentiment.According to figures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which are often used as a proxy for hedge fund activity, aggregate bets against the dollar versus the euro, yen, Swiss franc, sterling and the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars last week rose to their highest levels since July 2008, when the dollar hit a record low against the euro.But analysts say tracking the size of the carry trade, or whether or not risk appetite has improved sufficiently for it to return as a trading strategy is notoriously tough given the opaque nature of the currency markets.Steve Barrow at Standard Bank says the fact that high-yielding currencies have rallied for most of this year while the traditional carry trade funding currencies – the yen and the Swiss franc – have not weakened throws up one of two conclusions.“Either the carry trade has not returned and high-yielding currencies are strong in spite of any yield attraction, or another currency has supplanted the yen and the Swiss franc as the funding currency of choice,” he says. “If this is the dollar it could imply that the greenback is in real danger.”Mr Barrow says it is certainly possible given the dollar’s weakness, negative positioning, and the fact that short-term US interest rates are down to Swiss and yen levels that the dollar has assumed the position of the carry trade funding currency of choice.“It’s notoriously hard to find real data to determine the size of carry trades funded out of any currency, let alone the dollar. Hence, it has to remain the subject of conjecture,” he says. “Nonetheless, we feel that it is advisable to assume that this funding switch is happening.”
564;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-13T07:14:02Z;Securities lending is back but looks different;;"Once upon a time, lending securities to all and sundry seemed a sure fire way to top up returns from an equity portfolio, a no-brainer if you will.Large investors could simply lend their stock to hedge funds, pocket a fee and reinvest the cash they received as collateral, turning a steady, if unspectacular, profit.Then the credit crisis intervened to end the party.The collapse of Lehman Brothers meant loaned stock was not necessarily returned as promised, introducing an unwelcome bout of counterparty risk; asset owners were vilified for helping short-sellers bring a swathe of financial companies to their knees; and, worst of all, some lenders suffered losses on mortgage-backed securities and other toxic assets in which they had reinvested their cash collateral.“It’s the reinvestment side that, for most beneficial owners, has created the problems. They have had illiquidity and in some cases even losses,” says Kathy Rulong, global head of securities lending at BNY Mellon.A study of 34 North American pension plans, foundations and endowments by BNY Mellon and Finadium, a consultancy, found that, as of January, 17.5 per cent had stopped lending permanently as a result of the problems.The downsizing of the hedge fund industry, combined with lower leverage, also reduced demand for borrowed stock. According to Finadium, loan volumes of US equities have fallen from $717bn in 2007 to just $300bn (£181bn, €207bn).Yet the banks involved in servicing this activity remain upbeat, arguing that the worst has passed and some of those that recoiled from lending stock at the peak of the crisis are once more playing ball.“The vast majority of beneficial owners are reviewing their programmes based on their experiences within the industry in the last couple of years, but most are staying in lending, particularly the larger clients that have a staff that is large enough that they can oversee a programme adequately,” says Ms Rulong.Paul Wilson, global head of sales and relationship management for securities lending at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, adds: “We saw a small number of clients decide to leave the lending programme and a small number decide to suspend new loans going forward.“But all of those that temporarily suspended lending have returned to our lending programme and a high proportion of those that exited have returned.”Paul Lynch, head of trading, risk and portfolio strategies for securities finance at State Street, says of the 15 per cent or so of his bank’s clients that stopped lending – mostly US mutual fund houses worried by the “headline risk” around the practice – more than half have now returned.“Reinvestment risk is back to normal levels and headline risk has gone away dramatically. We are not expecting to see that next investment bank bankruptcy coming down the line,” he adds.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Finadium reports that loan volumes for S&P 500 stocks have risen by 40 per cent since March.But the revitalised securities lending industry will look a little different to its pre-2007 shape.According to Ms Rulong, the “utility model”, in which a lender loans as much of its stock as possible in order to maximise its revenues, is, to some degree, being supplanted by the “intrinsic value model”, under which asset owners restrict their lending activities to those “hot” stocks most in demand, earning almost as much as is available under the utility model while minimising exposure to counterparty and reinvestment risk.The BNY Mellon/Finadium study reported “substantial” momentum towards the intrinsic value approach in the six months to August.“We have concentrated on maximising intrinsic value,” says Ms Rulong. “We look to extract the maximum value from each individual security that is put out on loan. You can still maintain a good portion of your revenue, but by taking in less cash you don’t have the sheer number of investments to make.”Mr Lynch reports a similar trend, saying many of the State Street clients that have returned to the market are choosing only to lend “specials” – those stocks in most demand that command the highest prices – and remain unwilling to hire out lower value securities.This reluctance to lend across the board has helped support pricing in the stock lending market, even as the travails of the hedge fund industry have reduced demand.Concerns over reinvestment risk might also be expected to increase lenders’ desire to take non-cash collateral, such as government bonds or even equities, which does not need to be reinvested, but here the picture is far from clearcut.According to Mr Lynch, usage of non-cash collateral among State Street’s clients has edged up from 5-10 per cent before the crisis to 13 per cent now, with this figure higher in Europe than in the US.However JPMorgan’s Mr Wilson believes this trend has already started to reverse. “It has gone in cycles,” he says.“Post Lehman we definitely saw a reduction in the proportion of cash collateral. Now hedge funds and prime brokers are long cash, it has swung back the other way. We are probably doing more cash collateral than four or five months ago.”Mr Wilson also sees a partial unwinding in lenders’ desire to focus on very short term, liquid instruments in which to invest their cash collateral, a desire that peaked following the collapse of Bear Stearns.Against a backdrop of steepening yield curves, “many of our clients are allowing us to look at investments in the three to six months credit maturity range, as opposed to one week or one month,” he says.But not all the changes in train in the depths of the crisis are likely to be erased so quickly. Mr Wilson says the level of focus from beneficial owners on oversight of their lending programmes has “just exploded”, and lenders’ heightened desire to customise their activities to meet their own unique requirements and risk parameters is going to be an ongoing trend. “It is not going to be temporary,” he says with certainty."
565;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-13T07:14:02Z;Administrators feel the heat as hedge fund profits fall;;"Critical best describes the condition of the hedge fund market. Global assets slumped by more than 30 per cent last year, at least 150 European funds were axed, and new launches were few and far between.Unsurprisingly, hedge fund administrators have had to share some of this pain. “The impact has, and is going to be, generally quite severe for administrators,” says David Aldrich, managing director, alternative investment services at BNY Mellon.“The average fund administrator’s assets have fallen by about a third, which means revenues have fallen by about the same amount. At the start of 2008, average profitability was about 20 per cent, plus or minus 5 per cent, and so we have a massive problem – people are losing money.”The upshot, it seems, is that some smaller players will disappear from view. Huw Williams, segment head for hedge funds at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, says: “The fee pressure is considerable and some of the smaller hedge fund administrators are giving way to consolidation. Like some of the smaller hedge fund managers, smaller administrators are under threat of being wound up.”Mr Aldrich finds it hard to disagree: “A number of hedge fund administrators will leave the business through consolidation or will disappear completely,” he says, citing examples such as the tie-up between Fulcrum and Butterfield and the merger of Custom House with Equity Trust. “There is always room for independent administrators but with a limited number of solutions to offer they might suffer through down markets,” adds Maria Cantillon, global head of sales at BNP Paribas Securities Services.But it is not just smaller players at risk. The credit crisis has meant some bank-owned administrators are no longer core to their parent groups, and clients – experts say – are cognisant of this.“Some banks need to raise capital and divest themselves of non-core activities and that is going to influence who a client does business with. Clients are going to choose an administrator that will be there for the long haul,” says Mr Aldrich.Jack Klinck, global head of State Street’s Alternative Investment Solutions team, agrees: “There are definitely some larger players out there having strategic discussions about whether or not they want to remain in this business, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a big name disappear.”Mr Klinck is more reticent on whether this divestment will create any opportunities for State Street.He says the firm is always looking at potential deals in the marketplace but would not provide specific details.“We will see how this plays out,” he says. “We have nothing to report, but within the industry I am sure we will see more deals being done.”BNY Mellon’s Mr Aldrich adds: “We are interested in acquisitions and are always keen on having discussions. But to make an acquisition attractive we must get one or all of the following three: people, technology and assets. If a firm such as that pops up then we are interested in talking to them.”Problems persist for the industry; Union Bancaire Privée, one of the biggest fund of hedge fund operators, recently said it would cut 10 per cent of its work force this year after suffering a 19 per cent decline in assets under management. But there are signs of improvement.The pace of hedge fund closures has slowed while start-ups have increased, with the number of hedge funds liquidating assets falling by half to 376 in the first quarter from a record 778 in the fourth quarter last year, according to Hedge Fund Research.“Inflows are now greater than outflows and things have come back at a faster pace than was anticipated,” says Ms Cantillon. “The industry has had a great few months with some players enjoying performance up at around 9 per cent.”Mr Williams agrees: “There has been a lot of turmoil, no doubt, but there has been somewhat of a lift in the market. Redemptions have eased and new fund launches are beginning to come through.”Whether this pick-up will be enough to save some of the smaller players from extinction remains to be seen. SEI’s new business development and client services head, David Morrissey, thinks not.“The smaller providers that don’t have the capital available to invest in their business will struggle. Our annual expenditure hits $10m and whether or not some of the smaller players are able to make such a commitment to the business – even during good times – is questionable.”"
566;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-13T07:14:01Z;Depositaries balk at rules change;;The European Commission’s decision to include rules on depository banks in the forthcoming alternative investment fund managers directive, and to dust-off the 25-year old vague Ucits text book, have sparked fears the industry’s business case is in jeopardy.In a post-Lehman Brothers and Bernard Madoff world, Brussels’ general idea – as it conducts a consultation on Ucits depositaries – is to increase depositaries’ duties and responsibilities. It particularly wants to look at assets given to sub-custodians, which are increasingly used in an investment universe that always includes new markets and asset classes.The question is how liable a depository bank should be when clients’ asset losses occur as a result of the sub-custodian going bankrupt or being the object of fraud.“If legal responsibilities for depositaries are increased, it would change “the whole wiring diagram” of the industry, says Tim Keaney, co-chief executive at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.He says: “Banks may say they are happy to take on duties but at a significantly higher price. Or it could also be that we take on more work internally.“After the appointment of the manager, we are the clearing agent, the depo bank, the custodian, the trustee, the fund administrator. That’s the only way we would take on that risk.”In the most extreme scenario, depositaries would have to return assets held by a third-party agent whatever the circumstances.Global custodians warn such an insurance-scheme scenario goes too far. “Due to the tremendous level of risk induced . . . it could lead the depository bank, and even its group, to bankruptcy,” says Alain Closier, global head of Société Générale Securities Services.BNY Mellon, the fourth largest custodian in Europe, could exit the industry, it says. “Our company would look very hard at whether we remain in the depo bank business,” says Mr Keaney.If guaranteeing assets altogether would not make sense, depositaries believe there is an urgent need to clarify European rules. The events of the past 12 months have highlighted diverging views between member states, and between judicial powers and regulators.Mr Madoff’s fraud revealed Ucits’ outdated rules. Investors, especially French ones, were unable to get back assets invested in the US swindler’s Luxembourg feeder funds, sparking outrage in France, which said the Grand Duchy had below-the-grade rules.The Commission later stated there was an unlevel playing field between member states in the implementation of Ucits. But the statement was made on the basis of a review by Cesr, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, which was never completed.More worrying to custodians – they can always adapt to domestic rules, they say – was a ruling in April by a Paris court of justice. It said that two depository banks – RBC Dexia and SGSS – had an obligation to return clients’ assets which they had put in sub-custody with Lehman Brothers.Depositaries say it has created uncertainty. “What came out of France is a concern because it shows there are differences between the regulatory decision-makers and what a court might act upon,” says Mr Keaney.Furthermore, the decision of the French court could lead to depositaries avoiding the country.Banks may decide, if the situation is not clarified, to centralise their activity in countries “having a more favourable legislation to the detriment of more stringent markets”, says Mr Closier.Sandrine Leclercq, General Counsel at Caceis, says: “Regulation was done at a time when the depository banks’ job was not as complex. It wasn’t common to invest in an emerging country, in private equity or in alternatives.“The sub-custodian came later to provide access to remote markets. The prime broker was not intervening either. Today, the landscape has totally changed. There is a need to redefine clearly what we understand by safekeeping and custody.”But the need for clarification and – admittedly – harmonisation should not amount to revolution, depositaries argue.Jean-Michel Loehr, industry and government relations chief at RBC Dexia Investors Services, says: “We advocate a continued recognition of the existing standards of due care for depositaries and oppose its replacement with any form of absolute liability.“Well executed, enforced and monitored, it achieves a very high level of protection, leaving only a low level of marginal risk, essentially of a systemic, fraudulent or force majeure nature.”Ms Leclercq believes the duty of the depositary to do due diligence on the quality of the sub-custodian can only be “technical”. Risks linked, for example, to immature banking infrastructure are down to the manager who wants to invest in that particular market. “If this risk cannot be reduced [by choosing another sub-custodian], it is an investment risk,” she says.This is a view that some fund managers, not surprisingly, disagree with. Investor protection should be the only parameter when the cursor of regulation eventually stops, says Francis Candylaftis, chief executive of Eurizon Capital.He says: “Ucits funds are not risk-free insurance policies, but a retail customer will not accept to have all the assets of a fund blocked, unavailable or lost, because a sub-custodian he has never heard of has gone bankrupt. There is necessity to harmonise their responsibilities, but these have to be levelled up, not levelled down.”
567;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-06T08:14:25Z;Overlay launches volatility forex fund;;Overlay Asset Management, the currency management arm of BNP Paribas, will today launch an innovative fund focusing on volatility in the $3,200bn (£1,958bn, €2,249bn) a day foreign exchange markets.The fund provides an alternative to traditional directional currency trading at a time when the most common strategy, the carry trade, has suffered from strong correlation with equities and other mainstream asset classes.The launch of the SingleHedge Currency Option Fund forms part of Overlay’s expansion strategy. The Paris-based company, which has £11.3bn under management, will shortly open a London office.While volatility trading is relatively commonplace in equity markets it is much less advanced in other asset classes, although Bank of New York Mellon does offer a fund designed to exploit “extreme” market conditions in forex markets.“While we are not necessarily going to preclude the fund taking directional positions on spot rates, our idea is really to trade currency volatility,” said Elizabeth Para, currency investment strategist. “We expect the fund to display quite low correlation with the market.”The “highly leveraged” Dublin-domiciled Qualifying Investor Fund, primarily aimed at fund of fund managers who may already have currency exposure, is targeting returns of 20 per cent a year.
568;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-04T10:40:41Z;The bank that should have detected the fraud;;"Bernard Madoff had two primary bank accounts set up for him in New York. One account was with the Bank of New York Mellon, account number 866-1126-621 (referred to as BONY 621). This account was supposed to be the primary cash account for the legitimate broker-dealer business he and his brother Peter had in the late 1960s. Madoff also had an account at JPMorgan Chase, account number 140081703 (referred to as JPM 703), which investors used when wiring money or sending cheques to what would turn out to be a fake advisory business – a hedge fund, they thought at the time.This was also the account investors used when clients withdrew money from the fund. Many were able to withdraw funds within days, and Madoff always had the money ready, no matter how large the amount. It was one of his biggest selling points.After his arrest, Madoff would claim in court that the legitimate brokerage firm and the criminal hedge fund were completely separate. However, in 2001 money began to slosh back and forth between the two bank accounts regularly. Money was transferred from both the Bank of New York and the JPMorgan Chase accounts to Madoff’s London office; Madoff personally wired roughly $500m over to London and then back again between 2001 and 2008, according to copies of the documents filed by the Madoff trustee, Irving Picard. Over those seven years Madoff also withdrew cash from the broker-dealer’s account with Bank of New York, sometimes as much as $2m in a single day.It was this sort of cross-over that got some people on Wall Street wondering about the legitimacy of Madoff’s operations as early as September 2008.Madoff was close friends and business associates with a long-time over-the-counter trader named Aldo Parcesepe, a senior managing director and head of Nasdaq market making at the investment bank Bear Stearns. Parcesepe regularly traded with Madoff’s broker-dealer firm, and between 2005 and 2008, he served on the board of the National Stock Exchange (NSX), an electronic exchange for equities and options that the Madoffs had subsidised in the late 1970s.Madoff owned 10 per cent of the NSX, and Bear Stearns regularly traded through the exchange. Brokers who traded at Bear Stearns used the firm’s automated equity order system to buy and sell stocks. A broker would enter the stock symbol and the number of shares he or she wanted to trade. The system was supposed to do the rest: work to find the best counterparty to trade with from among the many market makers that traded with Bear Stearns.But for Nasdaq stocks, Bear Stearns had an unwritten code: the system automatically defaulted to trade with Madoff. Madoff reportedly paid Bear Stearns substantial fees for this default setting on their equity order system, and he may have paid other customers to do the same. Between 2000 and 2008, Bear Stearns’ 400 or so brokers all used this system, and all their Nasdaq trades defaulted to Madoff. It was a big source of revenue for Madoff and vaulted Bear Stearns to the largest counterparty trading with Madoff.The arrangement was in place when Bear Stearns went under in early 2008, and it continued under JPMorgan Chase, which took over Bear Stearns’ operations in the spring of 2008. It may have seemed an unfair system for Bear Stearns customers, but such agreements are common and legal.* * *On the illegal side, however, Madoff was busy building his Ponzi scheme. By 2006, Madoff had billions of dollars in cash on deposit in Chase Bank, and between 2006 and 2008, Chase Bank’s accounts from Madoff averaged several billion dollars. However, in 2008, as the stock markets began dropping precipitously, so did Madoff’s cash balance. Between September 2008 and December 11 2008, the Chase account often dropped near zero. In November, this forced Madoff to transfer roughly $160m from Madoff Securities International in London to the Chase Bank account. He was juggling payouts to investors demanding their money back and moving money from different offices and bank accounts around the world.He also continued to take in new investors. In the month of November, investors deposited $300m worth of new cash in the Chase account while Madoff withdrew $320m. And he was hitting up an old friend, Carl Shapiro, for a new investment—of $250m.Chase, meanwhile, was doing other business with Madoff besides banking. In 2006, JPMorgan Chase developed a derivative product for its wealthy clients. It was linked to the Fairfield Sentry Fund offered by a Madoff feeder fund, Fairfield Greenwich. The bank offered investors—mostly in Europe—a note that paid three times the earnings of the Sentry Fund. The note matured in five years. To hedge against the risk, JPMorgan Chase deposited three times the face value of the Fairfield notes into the Sentry Fund. This way, if the Sentry Fund did well, the bank’s returns would offset its obligation on the notes.By the summer of 2008, JPMorgan Chase had deposited $250m with the Sentry Fund. With the financial meltdown on Wall Street and around the world in full swing, most of the markets were down 30 per cent or more, and yet the Sentry Fund reported gains of 5 per cent. JPMorgan Chase began to grow suspicious. Representatives from the commercial banking side met with Madoff. They wanted to discuss his cash flows to know what percentage of his portfolio was leveraged, or invested using borrowed money, and to find out with whom he traded options contracts.The simple math showed that the options market was too small to handle the size and capacity of trading Madoff was claiming to manage using his supposed hedge fund strategy – an options-based strategy called the “split-strike conversion”. Moreover, it was implausible that Madoff could be generating substantial positive returns when the S&P 500 index was down 30 per cent.Madoff wouldn’t tell JPMorgan Chase any of the key information. Managers from the bank’s London office and colleagues in New York decided they would go through the back door: Aldo Parcesepe. Parcesepe’s trading desk had people who regularly traded with Madoff, and they knew the number of trades executed through Madoff. Through this route, JPMorgan Chase learned that Madoff’s trades with Bear Stearns—by then a part of JPMorgan Chase—could not possibly sustain a portfolio returning 10–12 per cent a year on what the bank knew from the commercial banking side had to exceed at least $7bn. It should have been obvious: Madoff was a fraud.* * *In September 2008, JPMorgan Chase quietly liquidated its entire $250m position in the Sentry Fund, even though it remained liable on the derivatives it had sold to the wealthy clients. At the time, the Fairfield Sentry investment notes were showing a 5 per cent gain for the year. Had the bank suspected Madoff was a phony, and the only way to protect itself was to liquidate anything connected with Madoff?Not only that, but by September 2008, Chase should have suspected that if Madoff’s hedge fund was a fraud, he was likely diverting his advisory side funds. Still, according to one lawsuit filed against the bank, Chase continued accepting wires and checks from Madoff’s latest round of investors. Throughout the fall of 2008, the bank “continued to work in partnership with Madoff despite being privy to information that the fraud was collapsing and therefore consuming more and more of the victim proceeds.”Kristin Lemkau, a JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman, told the New York Times earlier this year that the bank withdrew from the Madoff-linked funds after “a wide-ranging review of our hedge fund exposure.” She said the bank also “became concerned about the lack of transparency to some questions we posed as part of our review”. Investors weren’t told, she said, because under sales agreements the issues did not meet the threshold necessary to permit the bank to restructure the notes. Under those circumstances, she told the paper, “we did not have the right to disclose our concerns”.After Madoff’s fraud was found out, Michael Bienes, one of the men who first passed potential investors Madoff’s way – a sort of proto-feeder fund – explained why he never questioned how Madoff was making his returns:“I was gonna walk in and say, ‘Bernie, let me see your books’? He’d show me the door. He was my income. He was my life. How could I do such a thing?…And I knew that the SEC investigates brokerage houses, and I knew that Nasdaq did. So who am I? Who am I to say, “Bernie, show me your books’? And if he did, what would I know? What would I see? How could I judge? How could I figure it out? I had no way.”Years later, a team of bankers and traders at one of the world’s biggest banks trod where Bienes felt he couldn’t – yet still failed to warn the victims. The tragedy of the Madoff fraud is not of one man gone awry, for whatever his reasons, but of hundreds more who could have stopped him, and failed to.This is an edited extract from Erin Arvedlund’s ‘Madoff: The Man Who Stole $65 Billion’, published this week by Penguin, £9.99.

569;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
570;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-03T15:18:38Z;View of the Day: Concerns over Aussie dollar;;The outlook for the Australian dollar looks uncertain in spite of data pointing to unexpectedly strong domestic growth, says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.“There can be no question of Australia’s position at the vanguard of those economies emerging from the global downturn,” he says. “But whether this is sustainable is largely inconsequential as far as the dollar is concerned.”Given Australia’s status as a big commodity producer, the dollar’s fortunes are more closely linked to those of the global than of the domestic economy, Mr Mellor says. “There is an 86 per cent correlation between the performance of the Australian dollar against the US dollar and the CRB commodity index since 2002. The CRB has fallen 7.5 per cent since last month, and we doubt there will be any meaningful rebound in commodity prices in the near term.”Mr Mellor says China’s dominant role in a number of commodity markets and the fact that it constitutes Australia’s largest export market means it is a strong influence on the dollar. “Recent news flow from China certainly raises concerns about support for the currency.“Moreover, figures on Thursday highlighted that a combination of waning competitiveness and falling overseas demand is hitting Australian exports.“Overall, we believe the odds of some retracement for the Aussie dollar have grown considerably of late.”
571;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-09-01T19:42:11Z;Clients pull $4bn from HSBC arm;;"HSBC’s Geneva-based private bank saw clients withdraw more than $4bn from its hedge fund portfolios in the first half of the year, underlining the acute pressures facing the industry.The bank, which caters primarily to high net-worth individuals, said in a statement it had seen investors pull about SFr4.2bn ($3.9bn) from hedge funds in net terms between January and the end of June.The pull-back will have exacerbated problems at HSBC Alternative Investments, the fund of funds business run by the private bank that is now estimated to have about $22.27bn in assets under management.At its peak in September 2008, the division had an estimated $46.28bn in assets under management.The 52 per cent decline has made HSBC Alternative Investments, in absolute terms, the single largest casualty of the redemptions crisis in the hedge fund industry.The redemption rate over the first half of this year has been considerably shallower than that experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008, however.Then, fears over liquidity, exposure to troubled funds, frauds such as the Madoff scandal and the parlous state of many prime brokerages after the collapse of Lehman Brothers led investors to flee funds of hedge funds en masse.Alongside HSBC Alternative Investments, many of the largest and most established fund of funds managers, such as Man Investments; Permal Asset Management; and Notz, Stucki & Ci, saw assets under management plummet.According to research by the US consultancy firm Casey Quirk and the Bank of New York Mellon earlier this year, about 53 per cent of redemption requests lodged with hedge funds and funds of funds over the past 18 months have come from private bank platforms such as that run by HSBC’s Swiss bank.A further 27 per cent of all redemption requests came directly from family offices and individual investors.Management at HSBC’s private bank attributed continuing redemptions from their clients in the first half to the bank’s decision not to chase market share or deposits by increasing rates and lowering margins.Alexandre Zeller, chief executive, said that risk appetite among wealthy clients was beginning to return, however, and many were now looking to reinvest, having moved into cash a year ago.Total assets under management at the bank are up 4 per cent to $176bn year to date."
572;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-08-16T19:06:16Z;Capital gained from culture;;Gordon Nixon makes a point of escaping Canada’s frigid winter each January for a Caribbean cruise. But the excursion is more work than pleasure for Royal Bank of Canada’s chief executive. His 700 fellow passengers are RBC tellers, administrative staff, junior employees and middle managers who are being rewarded for superior performance.Mr Nixon joins the cruises to put into practice the teamwork and mutual respect he has tried to foster among RBC’s 73,000 employees in eight years at the helm of Canada’s biggest bank.As he sees it, that culture has played a crucial role in RBC’s ability – rivalled by only a handful of other large banks – to ride out the storms that have battered the financial services industry during the past two years.“We don’t tolerate fiefdoms and so forth,” Mr Nixon says. “Those are the sort of things that brought down a lot of organisations.”Teamwork and “doing the right thing for the organisation” are non-negotiable elements of RBC’s culture, Mr Nixon says. “We can have the hottest-shot trader in the world, but if he doesn’t comply with the culture and values of the organisation, we don’t want that person being part of the [bank].”None of Canada’s big five banks – the others are Toronto-Dominion, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce – has escaped the turmoil unscathed.RBC itself has taken billions of dollars of writedowns in the past two years on holdings of toxic securities and other asset impairments. Its expanding US retail network, now comprising about 441 branches centred on south-eastern states, has taken its share of knocks from the housing market and the weak economy. Analysts expect loan losses to continue rising in coming months as the recession takes its toll.Even so, the Canadian banks are emerging from the crisis in better shape than most of their rivals elsewhere in the world. They have survived without any infusion of government money, and have relied far less on liquidity support than US and European lenders. All five have maintained their dividends.RBC and Toronto-Dominion are two of just six banks worldwide that are still clinging to a Moody’s triple-A credit rating. (The others are Bank of New York Mellon, Luxembourg’s Banque et Caisse d’Epargne, Rabobank Nederland and Zuercher Kantonalbank in Switzerland.) RBC has posted net income of C$5.7bn ($5.2bn, €3.7bn, £3.1bn) during the past 18 months, in spite of C$3.8bn in writedowns and rising loan-loss provisions. It will report third-quarter results on August 27.Helped by a combination of fresh capital from private investors, retained earnings and shrunken balance sheets, the Canadian banks boast an average tier one ratio of capital to assets of almost 11 per cent, compared with 10 per cent in the US and less than 9 per cent in the UK.Estimating RBC’s excess capital at C$7bn-C$8bn, Mr Nixon says: “We’re now clearly over-capitalised.” But, he adds: “I’d much rather be criticised for that than being under-capitalised or over-leveraged. We have the flexibility in this environment to invest in our businesses, to grow our asset base at a time when many banks in the world are having to continue to increase their capital levels and to shrink their balance sheets.”Mr Nixon, 52, has a reputation as a level-headed manager. He joined Dominion Securities – at the time Canada’s biggest brokerage firm – 30 years ago and stayed on after RBC acquired it in 1987. He has spent most of his career in investment banking, including a three-year stint in Tokyo.He is “very comfortable” with the balance he has “between work and family and social and sports”. He has a passion for golf and enjoys the occasional Saturday-morning game of ice hockey with “a bunch of old farts”. And his family has a lakeside cottage north of Toronto.RBC is gearing up to take advantage of its strong position. “I think we’ve got a period here that’s going to last at least two to five years where banks around the world are going to be shrinking their balance sheets when we have the ability to invest in all of our businesses,” he says.Asked what RBC will look like five years from now, Mr Nixon is noncommittal. “In many ways that’s a dangerous question because it was at the root of some of the problems that some banks had in the early part of this decade,” he says.“There’s no hurry because there are going to be lots of opportunities and lots of restructuring in the financial services industry over the next five years. So if you do something, you want to make sure it’s very sensible and very strategic.”He rules out some options, such as a move into retail banking outside RBC’s established markets in Canada, the US and the Caribbean. “We are going to go into markets where we actually have a franchise, where we have a brand, where we have an ability to generate a reasonable return,” he says.Those criteria apply in wealth management and capital markets too. RBC is already among the world’s top 20 money managers, and almost three-quarters of its capital markets business is outside Canada.On the capital markets side, however, Mr Nixon says: “We’re not going to make an acquisition. We’re going to grow it by continuing to do what we’ve been doing for the past five years – which is to hire people, hire teams, extend our balance sheet, build our customer base.”The turmoil south of the border has created an opening for RBC and other Canadian banks to cherry-pick the casualties of the financial crisis without considering acquisitions.RBC has recruited more than 100 senior bankers who used to work for Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and UBS, among others. Its US wealth management arm has hired 300 consultants so far this year. The bank’s total headcount grew 13 per cent last year.“There are a lot of options that we have that are non-transformational that will make a big difference in terms of how we perform,” Mr Nixon says.He is more cautious about what he describes as a “transformational” acquisition.Mr Nixon does not rule out a blockbuster deal, but he says: “If you too aggressively say that you want to do that transformational transaction, then you end up making decisions that are not necessarily the right decisions for the organisation.“You saw a lot of that in the early part of this decade.”
573;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-08-16T17:56:37Z;Fears over lack of transparency in region;;"Gulf-based banks may have largely avoided the initial stages of the credit crunch, but the subsequent economic fall-out is increasingly impacting financial institutions across the region.Analysts have also started to warn of potential trouble hidden in a previously safe part of banks’ loan books: exposure to large family groups and conglomerates.The Gulf’s wealthy merchant families dominate the region’s private sector, and were considered safe and reliable borrowers, until troubles emerged at two major Saudi groups earlier this summer.The financial problems of two of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent companies – Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi & Brothers and Saad Group – have raised issues of transparency in a region where accurate and timely data is limited and many family companies – which dominate the private sector – are notoriously secretive.Between them, the Saudi groups are thought to owe about $20bn to more than 100 local and international banks, and concern over exposure has hit the share prices of leading banks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.“There is a big question mark over the quality of loans to large, family-owned groups – known as name lending – and there isn’t a lot of transparency on this,” says Raj Madha, a banking analyst at EFG-Hermes.The UAE has been particularly affected by rising loan delinquencies.Specific provisions for impaired loans have risen by a fifth this year to $6.5bn by the end of June, while general provisions have nearly doubled to $2.5bn, according to the central bank.“Times are rough for banks,” says Hani Kablawi, chairman of Bank of New York Mellon in the Middle East.“We haven’t seen the end of it, and the jury is still out on how much they will have to provision for bad loans later this year.”Local banking earnings were down 23.7 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year, according to EFG-Hermes, a regional investment bank.However, the rich Gulf governments have acted robustly to safeguard their domestic financial sectors.In the UAE, the federal government has guaranteed deposits and interbank lending, set up an emergency liquidity mechanism for cash-strapped banks and injected about Dh50bn ($13.6bn) of extra deposits.Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab economy, cut reserve requirements for the first time since 1980 and markedly increased government spending to stimulate the economy and ensure vital projects go ahead.Small but gas-rich Qatar has been particularly active in propping up its financial system.It has committed to taking up to 20 per cent stakes in all local banks and bought up nearly $10bn worth of real estate and local equity investment portfolios, to prevent potential writedowns from
crippling lending in the ambitious state.“From a capital adequacy and liquidity point of view the Gulf banks have enough of a cushion,” says Chris Niehaus, a managing director at UBS in Dubai. “There will be more and more non-performing loans throughout the year, but the banks are in general well-capitalised.”However, local banks are still reluctant to lend,
preferring to park cash at central banks.After years of brisk expansion, credit growth has slumped in 2009, and net new lending is running at a third of the level it was before Lehman Brothers collapsed, according to Caroline Grady, an economist at Deutsche Bank."
574;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-08-12T20:49:55Z;Bargain hunters drive Wall St higher;;"US stocks bounced on Wednesday, recovering most of the previous day’s losses as buyers were tempted back into the market following two days of falls.Financial stocks were heavily bought after dragging the market lower on Tuesday.Citigroup, shares in which have been volatile recently, shedding over 6 per cent on Tuesday following a 20 per cent surge over the previous seven sessions, gained 7.9 per cent to $3.98.Wells Fargo advanced 1 per cent to $27.17 and JPMorgan rose 2.4 per cent to $42.21.Bank of New York Mellon was also higher after it announced its plans to buy Insight Investment Management from Lloyds bank. BNY Mellon’s shares picked up 2.3 per cent to $28.71.Insurer Allstate was one of the steepest climbers in the financial sector, rising 6.3 per cent to $28.42 after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recommended buying the shares, saying the company’s fundamentals remained strong and that the shares were undervalued following recent falls.Equities saw a turbulent afternoon as investors responded to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).The announcement that there would be no increase in quantitative easing and that the Fed saw economic activity “levelling out” saw stocks slip, before jumping, and then selling off shortly before the close.“The language was pretty optimistic, although with a note of caution,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, said: “I think ‘levelling out’ confused the market a little bit, and it points to a divided Fed.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,005.81 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,361.61 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,998.72.“We may be in for some bouncing around as investors decide whether to trust in the recovery and take the plunge into equities,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.Homebuilders were especially strong after Toll Brothers, which builds luxury houses, said cancellations fell and orders rose during the previous quarter, although it added that its units were selling for cheaper prices.Toll Brothers’ shares jumped 14.4 per cent to $23.42 and gave a boost to others in the sector.DR Horton gained 2.6 per cent to $13.45, while Lennar rose 4 per cent to $13.52.There was some optimism on consumer activity after department store Macy’s kicked off the retailers’ earnings season by beating earnings estimates and raising its full-year forecast.The shares were volatile, however, with some concern over the company’s warning of a “very difficult” trading environment as well as the fact its forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations.After a brief fall during the pre-market session, the shares rose 6 per cent to $16.40 during the day.Shares inSara Lee also bounced around after the company made a narrower loss than expected after one-off charges. There was strength in North American sales, which helped boost the shares before the bell, but they subsequently fell and finished 10 per cent down at $9.72.Meanwhile, Applied Materials, which produces equipment to make microchips, reported a narrower loss than predicted on relatively strong sales. Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $13.66.The IPO market has shown signs of life in the past few days, culminating on Wednesday with what is likely to become the biggest US offering this year from Starwood Property Trust. The trust, which will invest in real estate, offered its shares at $20 and held on to that to close the day unchanged.But Emdeon,a healthcare services company, jumped on its first day of trade and the shares, which were priced at $15.50, climbed
6.6 per cent to $16.52.Imax, the cinema chain that shows films in 3D, entered the market on Tuesday priced on the Nasdaq at $8.50.Strong buying during the day saw the shares rise to $9.11 and they continued to build on that on Wednesday, strengthening 1.5 per cent to $9.25."
575;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-08-12T17:57:42Z;Lloyds sells Insight to BNY for £235m;;Lloyds Banking Group has agreed to sell its Insight asset management business to Bank of New York Mellon for £235m.BNY is taking on £80bn in funds managed by Insight for clients outside the Lloyds group, as well as the Insight management team led by Abdallah Nauphal. The £235m price tag consists of £200m in cash and the remainder in equity.Analysts say the deal may mark the start of a phase of consolidation and disposals among mid-sized asset management groups facing increasing margin pressure.Before HBOS’s merger with Lloyds TSB, Mr Nauphal was chief executive of Insight and led its expansion into so-called liability-driven investment – funds that seek to match pension scheme assets more closely to promises. That was Insight’s fastest-growing business and, according to Barclays Capital, made Insight the UK’s fastest-growing institutional asset manager last year. Mr Nauphal is known to have wanted to sell Insight as an autonomous unit, keeping the business intact.Insight’s remaining £57bn of in-house funds – Clerical Medical branded insurance policies and the Bank of Scotland wealth management division – are being transferred to Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, based in Edinburgh, increasing Swip’s assets under management from £83bn to about £125bn.BNY Mellon beat several rivals in the auction for Insight, including Schroders and Hellman & Friedman, the US private equity group that owns Gartmore, a rival UK fund management group. BNY Mellon has about £600bn in funds, of which £170bn is managed by a series of UK investment management boutiques, including Walter Scott & Partners and Newton Investment Management.Jason M. Goldberg, analyst at Barclays Capital, said: “The purchase price equates to 0.3 per cent of assets under management, at the lower end of recent transactions, though these look to be lower fee generating assets.”Insight’s revenues in 2006 and 2007 were about £127m. However, the business was lossmaking until it made pre-tax profits of £11.8m in the year to December 2007.The sale is likely to be the first of a series of large disposals by the Lloyds group, which is 43.5 per cent owned by the taxpayer and is shrinking its balance sheet. The bank is in talks with the European Commission about state aid approval, which is likely to require hefty disposals.● Pakistan’s privately owned Muslim Commercial Bank, the country’s biggest lender by market value, has agreed an $87m (£53m) deal to buy a 99.4 per cent stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland’s Pakistan branches, according to a statement given to the Karachi stock exchange, writes Farhan Bokhari in Lahore.The deal still requires regulatory approval, al­though analysts said that approval was a formality.RBS is selling or shutting down its businesses in two-thirds of the 54 countries where it operates, including Pakistan, after suffering the largest losses in British corporate history last year.
576;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-08-11T23:01:00Z;US court to hear Lehman Brothers swap case;;A US court is to consider, under US bankruptcy law, a dispute involving Lehman Brothers and the unwinding of a complex structured vehicle in what is being touted as a landmark case for the derivatives and securitisation industries.A US bankruptcy judge on Tuesday rejected a motion by the Bank of New York Mellon to dismiss a complaint by Lehman, the collapsed bank, seeking priority in the repayment of claims related to a special purpose vehicle called Dante.Investors who bought notes issued by Dante have argued they should be paid first and the UK courts have agreed, but have stayed any enforcement until appeals have been heard.Lawyers for the Lehman estate want the case heard in the US where Lehman’s main bankruptcy proceedings are being held. The US case has the potential to support or contest the UK court decision.The dispute centres on the priority of claims for the Dante SPV. Dante is one of a string of SPVs created to issue credit-linked notes to investors and to which Lehman was a swap counterparty, an arrangement known as a synthetic collateralised debt obligation. The case is drawing attention because swap counterparties are normally repaid ahead of other creditors, unless the counterparty is in default.“The subordination of the swap termination payments due to counterparties in default was a long-standing feature in securitisations,” said Kevin Kendra, a managing director in the structured credit group at Fitch Ratings. “The enforcement of that feature is now being tested because this is the first time that we have a major derivative counterparty going through bankruptcy.”With Lehman in default, investors in that SPV represented in the UK case by Perpetual Trustee Company, believe they should be paid ahead of Lehman, as is set out under the English law governing the transaction.But lawyers for Lehman Brothers Special Financing believe the subordination of Lehman’s claim is contrary to US bankruptcy laws, which do not allow forfeiture of assets on bankruptcy. Analysts believe the case could have important implications for the securitisation market.“A ruling against the investors would be hugely negative for the credit markets as the concept of bankruptcy remoteness will most likely not be valid for any transaction if the swap counterparty has a US connection,” said analysts at Creditsights in a report last month ahead of the UK decision. They believed such a decision could lead to further rating downgrades for similar collateralised debt obligations.The case also highlights the difficulties in unwinding the structured vehicles that were set up during the credit boom and without failure in mind.
577;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-08-11T18:31:26Z;Speculation grows over dollar’s turning point;;"Just a week after the dollar hit its lowest level for 10 months, the main talking point in FX markets is whether the US currency is about to strengthen.The change of sentiment has been sparked by last week’s US payrolls report, which saw far fewer job losses in July than expected. This strengthened the view that the US is past the worst of its recession and that its economic recovery could precede that of Europe and Japan.“Markets are in a flurry of debate about whether Friday’s US payrolls data marks an inflection point for FX, whereby good US economic news starts to benefit rather than hurt the dollar,” says Ray Farris at Credit Suisse.Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas says there are signs that the US economy has responded positively to the massive US fiscal and monetary stimulus, thus reducing the risk premium for holding US assets.“The introduction of quantitative easing in March has let the performance of the dollar diverge from the guidance of real interest rate differentials,” he says.“Now, as the economic outlook has stabilised, the relative yield and interest rate differentials should regain their impact on currency markets.”Others are hesitant to call an end to the trend of dollar weakness, given that the currency’s rebound has been based on its reaction to a single piece of economic data.“If there is a shift, it’s at a very embryonic stage,” says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.But if the dollar does continue to rise, it would mark a very significant development given the pattern of trading that has tended to characterise the currency markets since the onset of the financial crisis.This has seen the dollar benefit from haven demand when equities, and hence risk appetite, have fallen.In contrast, the dollar has lost ground when stocks and investor confidence have risen as investors abandon the relative safety of the US currency in search of higher returns elsewhere.Thus as equities hit their highest level of the year last week, the dollar index, which tracks its progress against a basket of six major currencies, fell to its lowest level since October.This correlation has led to the perverse situation where the dollar has fallen on better US economic data and rallied when news from the US has disappointed.This pattern seemed to break down last Friday after the US employment report. The positive surprise generated a predictable rise in equity markets and a surge in US Treasury yields. The dollar also strengthened.Todd Elmer at Citigroup says this was a rare event indeed, since over the past 18 months, S&P gains of 1.7 per cent or more were associated with moves higher in the dollar index of 1 per cent or more on fewer than four occasions.One key reason for the dollar rebound was that US interest rate expectations surged on the jobs data, moving to price in 130 basis points of monetary tightening over the next 12 months.But the question for investors now is whether this is the start of a more concerted trend in which a rebound in US growth supports the dollar.“We have argued for some time that higher US bond yields, as long as they are associated with stronger growth rather than increasing worries about the US fiscal position and potential for the monetisation of debt, were good for the dollar,” says Adarsh Sinha at Barclays Capital. Several factors will determine whether this happens, he says.First, the dollar’s rise last week came at a time when oil prices were moving sideways. Mr Sinha says the dollar remains vulnerable to any rise in the price of oil.Second, the outcome of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting will be crucial to the dollar’s fate.If the Fed remains dovish, the strength of the dollar may prove temporary, says Mr Sinha. Conversely, it might continue to strengthen if the central bank announces no extension to its asset purchase programme and sounds more upbeat on the US economy.“This would likely be dollar positive and may herald a period where positive news for US yields continues to support the dollar as long as it is associated with stronger activity data and a muted response in commodity markets,” he says.But not all analysts are convinced of the significance of Friday’s move, especially since it was not the first time in recent months that the dollar had rallied following a stronger-than-expected US jobs report. Indeed, it last occurred following the release of the US employment report for May, which was released on June 5.On that occasion the dollar’s gains proved short-lived, partly because talk of an early increase in Fed interest rates quickly faded.Callum Henderson at Standard Chartered believes the move this time is just
a short-term phenomenon reflecting stretched positioning prior to the figures.Bets on further dollar weakness – short dollar positions – were at their highest level since June 2008, according to positioning data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, going into the jobs report. Thus when the dollar pushed higher, the move was exaggerated as traders were forced to cover their losses and buy dollars.“Clearly, the market was short of dollars going into the figures, but there is no case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates,” says Mr Henderson.He says the fact that the present crisis started in the US means the US economy is likely to emerge last from the present downturn and the Fed the last
to tighten monetary policy.Mr Henderson believes US interest rates are likely to remain on hold until 2011, keeping the dollar under pressure in a repeat of the price action that followed aggressive Fed easing in 2001. “The dollar fell sharply from 2002 to 2004,” says Mr Henderson. “The dollar is going to grind painfully lower over the next couple of years.”"
578;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-08-04T22:44:47Z;BNY Mellon in talks over manager Insight;;Bank of New York Mellon is in advanced talks to buy the bulk of Insight Investment Management, one of the UK’s biggest fund managers, in a deal that could be valued at up to £235m.BNY Mellon beat several rival bidders in the auction for Insight, which was acquired by Lloyds Banking Group when it merged with HBOS last year. The rivals included Schroders and Hellman & Friedman, the US private equity group that owns Gartmore, a rival UK fund management group.The Insight management team headed by Abdallah Nauphal, chief executive until the merger with Lloyds, was keen to sell the business to a bidder that would keep the unit intact, people close to the situation said.Mr Nauphal was instrumental in the group’s move into funds that match pension scheme investments more closely to their liabilities, Insight’s fastest-growing business which along with fixed income makes up the bulk of funds managed for non-Lloyds and HBOS clients.BNY Mellon is poised to buy this third-party business, which has about £74bn or two-thirds of Insight’s total £117bn in assets under management, for between £220m and £250m.Insight’s revenues in 2006 and 2007 were about £127m. However, the business was lossmaking until 2007. It made pre-tax profit of £11.8m in the year to December 2007, against losses before tax of £3.5m in 2006, according to Companies House.Insight’s remaining funds – in-house Clerical Medical insurance policy funds – are being merged into the £80bn of funds managed by Scottish Widows Investment Partnership.The sale is likely to be the first of a series of large disposals by the Lloyds group, which is 43.5 per cent-owned by the taxpayer and is shrinking its balance sheet. The bank is in talks with the European Commission about state aid approval. The Commission has indicated that Lloyds will have to make hefty disposals to gain approval for its plan.Lloyds will today report first-half results, which are expected to show a jump in bad debts of £11bn-£13bn due to escalating losses on commercial property and corporate loans originating from the HBOS loan book.However, Lloyds could report a statutory profit of £3bn to £4bn bolstered by one-off gains and exceptionals including a gain relating to the write back of goodwill from the HBOS deal. Analysts expect, stripping these out, that the bank will report an underlying loss of £6.3bn.
579;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-30T20:46:13Z;Tarp banks award billions in bonuses;;Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, which lost $55bn in 2008, between them paid 1,400 employees bonuses of $1m or more each, according to a New York state report, released on Thursday, on banks propped up with taxpayer funds.The study, compiled by Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney-general, showed that JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which both finished in the black last year, paid the most million-dollar bonuses - 1,626 and 953, respectively.However, the totals at a profitable bank such as Goldman were nearly matched by two of the year’s biggest losers on Wall Street. Citi, which suffered a $27.7bn loss, paid million-dollar bonuses to 738 employees. Merrill, which lost $27.6bn, paid 696 bonuses of $1m or more.“There is no clear rhyme or reason to the way banks compensate and reward their employees,” Mr Cuomo said. “Compensation for bank employees has become unmoored from the banks’ financial performance.”Representative Edolphus Towns, head of the House committee on government oversight and reform, pledged to hold hearings in September on the matter, suggesting the controversy over bankers’ bonuses is likely to continue later this year.Earlier, Mr Cuomo had detailed the number of million-dollar bonus payments made at Merrill in the last days of 2008, before it was acquired by Bank of America. In his new report, sent to Mr Towns’ committee, Mr Cuomo detailed the number and size of bonuses at eight other banks that received billions from the federal troubled asset relief programme fund last October.JPMorgan, which earned $5.6bn in 2008, set aside a total of $8.7bn for bonuses. The report shows that JPMorgan paid out bonuses in excess of $3m to more than 200 employees The bank received $25bn in Tarp funds last year and paid the money back last month.At Goldman, the bonus pool last year was $4.8bn, more than twice the $2.3bn it earned for the year. Goldman paid $3m or more to 212 employees. The bank paid back $10bn in Tarp funds last month.Citigroup set aside $5.3bn for its bonus pool, and paid bonuses of $3m or more to 124 employees. Like Bank of America, Citigroup received a total of $45bn in Tarp funds in 2008 and has recently converted some of that funding into common equity.BofA paid bonuses of $3m to 28 employees and million-dollar bonuses to 172. The Charlotte, North Carolina, bank reported a profit of $4bn in 2008 and set aside $3.3bn for bonuses.Morgan Stanley earned $1.7bn last year and set aside $4.5bn for bonus payments. The firm paid bonuses of $3m to 101 employees and million-dollar bonuses to 428. Morgan Stanley received $10bn in Tarp funds last year, and paid back the money in June.Among the other banks in Mr Cuomo’s report, Bank of New York Mellon paid 74 million-dolllar bonuses, Wells Fargo paid 62 and State Street paid 44.
580;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-30T18:00:39Z;Beijing’s dollar trap;;China is caught in a dollar trap that has prompted a concerted effort to “internationalise” the renminbi and promote its use outside the country.Fears over the value of China’s massive dollar holdings, accumulated over the past decade as the country pursued an aggressive policy of export-led growth, have been the trigger for the move.The market’s focus thus far during the financial crisis has been on China’s call for less dependence on the dollar as a reserve currency and repeated calls for the US to avoid debasing its currency through aggressive monetary and fiscal easing.But many analysts believe China’s calls for a change to the international monetary regime – earlier this year it suggested using the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing right as a reserve currency – are merely a distraction.Indeed, China has little incentive to talk down the dollar and such calls are regarded as little more than pleas to the US authorities to keep their finances in check.Simon Derrick, at Bank of New York Mellon, says China is not in a position to sell a significant portion of its dollar holdings in the open market without causing considerable damage to itself. This means that it must explore a number of different short- and long-term strategies to deal with the problem.“Developments this year indicate that China now believes that its best long-term strategy is to increase the international role of the renminbi, including its use as a reserve currency,” he says. “This might be the first signal that China is now considering a potential timetable, presumably over years rather than months, for moving towards capital account convertibility.”It is no wonder the Chinese are concerned about their exposure to the US.China announced its foreign exchange reserves, the world’s largest, had risen by a record $178.3bn to $2,130bn in the second quarter. Although the exact breakdown of the stockpiles is a secret, analysts estimate that 65-70 per cent are held in dollars.The largest increase in reserves was in May, when the dollar weakened sharply as Treasury yields in the US rose. Fear of a weaker dollar contributed to inflows to China, sparking offsetting intervention by the Chinese authorities to stem strength in the renminbi.Clearly more dollar weakness – it hit its lowest level against a basket of six leading currencies this week – is not in China’s interest. Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, says this has prompted Chinese policymakers to rethink the root causes of the “dollar trap” they find themselves in.“There is a growing consensus in Beijing that one of the fundamental reasons the country has fallen into this trap is that its own currency is not yet an international currency,” he says.This means Chinese exporters and importers have to rely on the dollar for invoicing more than 70 per cent of the country’s $2,600bn annual trade flows.With China’s exports surging nearly 30 per cent annually from 2002 to 2007, and government controls on overseas investment by domestic corporations and households, most of the dollar receipts can be recycled out of the country though just one channel: the central bank’s reserve accumulation.“To find an ultimate solution to this issue, apart from gradually loosening controls on capital outflows, Beijing has realised that it is time to push the internationalisation of the renminbi,” says Mr Qu.Mr Qu says this move is long overdue, given China’s rising economic power relative to the limited use of the renminbi overseas.China’s nominal gross domestic product topped $4,300bn last year and is estimated to reach $4,700bn this year, implying that China may overtake Japan as the world’s second-largest economy in 2010. HSBC says China was already ranked as the world’s third-largest trading country last year, and is likely to overtake Germany as the world’s second-largest trading nation by the end of this year.In order to kick-start the process of internationalisation, China has begun an ambitious scheme to raise the role of the renminbi in international trade and finance and reduce reliance on the dollar.Earlier this month, China announced a pilot initiative that expanded settlement agreements between Hong Kong and five big trading cities, including Guangzhou and Shanghai.On top of this, to provide seed money to its trading partners, this year the People’s Bank of China has signed a total of Rmb650bn ($95bn) in bilateral currency swap agreements with six central banks: South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Belarus and Argentina.HSBC says China is still in talks with other central banks to form additional swap agreements and was likely to expand them to cover all the country’s trade with Asia, excluding Japan.This would be followed by an expansion to take in other emerging market countries, including those in the Middle East and Latin America, that needed renminbi to pay for their imports of Chinese manufactured goods.Mr Qu believes the process of internationalising the renminbi may be quicker than many expect, estimating that more than half of China’s total trade flows, primarily bilateral trade with emerging market countries, are likely to be settled in renminbi in the next three to five years.“This means that nearly $2,000bn worth of cross-border trade flows would be settled in renminbi, making it one of the top three currencies used in global trade,” he says.But not all analysts believe that China can solve its dollar dependency so quickly.Indeed, Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman describes China’s efforts so far in providing currency swap lines as a “drop in a bucket” compared with its trading volumes.He says China’s dollar dependency is a problem of its own making, given that its reserve accumulation has sometimes been larger than its trade surplus as it sterilises foreign direct investment and speculative inflows into the country.“I don’t see how use of the renminbi, even if it could be foisted on other countries would solve any of China’s problems,” says Mr Chandler.He says a more flexible currency will help the Chinese authorities avoid painting themselves deeper into a corner, but it will not change China’s competitive position very much, given the way it really competes is cheap labour costs. I think the talk of international monetary regime change and the renminbi as an invoicing currency is largely political posturing.”
581;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-26T09:19:19Z;BNY Mellon urged to make acquisition;;BNY Mellon must acquire another asset management house if it is to compete effectively with State Street and the new BlackRock/BGI monolith, according to independent research group CreditSights.The research firm also names Legg Mason as an ideal target.It says the US house would benefit from buying a manager that specialises in equities because it has “a lower proportion of equity assets under management than its peers”.BNY Mellon, which was itself linked to a possible bid for BGI, has €50bn (£43bn, 71bn) of European retail assets under management.In a report entitled Scale Acquisitions, CreditSights says: “We believe the company (BNY) could look to address the gap in its product mix by acquiring an asset manager with equity products, and we believe Legg Mason is the most attractive target.”Legg Mason’s stock, it says, has underperformed (-53 per cent) the asset management sector, which has itself declined by 37 per cent during the past 12 months.“Largely due to the asset manager’s performance during the current cycle, BNY Mellon could improve its earnings by almost 15 per cent by acquiring Legg,” says David Hendler from CreditSights.Legg Mason’s net outflows were $30bn for the quarter ending June 30, 30 per cent lower than in the first quarter and 61 per cent lower than in the fourth quarter of 2008.BNY Mellon says it does not comment on “market rumour and speculation” and refused to answer questions on any potential tie-up with Legg Mason, but Ronald O’Hanley, the company’s chief executive, said earlier this year the group was on an acquisition drive, and he hoped to add to BNY Mellon’s 18 fund management boutiques.“From a distribution perspective we would like to add to our business and Asia is something we are especially interested in looking at. Now is not a bad time to make additions because valuations are so cheap,” he said.BNY Mellon is said to be one of three remaining contenders to buy Nikko, the Japanese asset management unit of Citigroup, although Sumitomo Trust and Banking is in pole position. Nikko Asset Management is Japan’s third-largest fund manager with around $90bn of assets under management. It is expected to be sold for more than $1bn.On the general topic of mergers and acquisitions, Jamie Brookes, global head of asset management communications at BNY Mellon, said in May the group was “often linked with potential M&A deals and receives a lot of interest from parties wanting to sell their businesses”.CreditSights says: “We note there were media reports that BNY Mellon was interested in acquiring BGI but seemed to have bid less than BlackRock was willing to pay. We believe BGI should have fetched between $7.5bn and $10.5bn, which is considerably lower than the $13.5bn BlackRock paid for the unit.“Given that more actively managed fund companies sold for premiums of 2 per cent and an index fund is a lower-margin business, we believe a price tag of 50 basis points to 70 basis points of assets under management is more suitable in this case.”BGI was eventually priced at 89 basis points.BlackRock will pay $6.6bn in cash and the rest in shares for BGI, with Barclays taking a stake of almost 20 per cent in the merged company. The UK bank’s chairman Bob Diamond and chief executive John Varley will both sit on the board of the new group, to be called BlackRock Global Investors.The transaction is expected to be finalised in the fourth quarter of this year. At close, BlackRock will have more than 9,000 employees in 24 countries.The BlackRock/BGI tie-up will create an asset management powerhouse with about $2,700bn of assets under management. BNY Mellon’s global assets are $880bn, while Legg Mason has $656bn under management.Chris Newlands is editor of Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
582;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-22T20:32:50Z;Wall Street fluctuates on mixed signals;;US stocks fluctuated on Wednesday as investors reacted to signs of strength in the housing and consumer sectors and mixed messages on banks’ future bad debts.Banks opened lower as Wall street reacted to warnings by several companies of loan losses to come.But they turned around after Andrew Cecere, chief financial officer of US Bancorp said he saw credit write-offs stabilising.US Bancorp rose 3.8 per cent to $18.96, while Morgan Stanley, which made a wider loss than expected after making a $700m writedown on its commercial real estate portfolio, rebounded after heavy early losses to end 0.1 per cent lower at $27.54.Mr Cecere’s words also helped other regional banks enjoy a strong afternoon in spite of mixed earnings.SunTrust, which made a narrower loss than expected, ended 6.7 per cent up at $16.19 while KeyCorp, which missed analysts’ estimates, was 7.1 per cent higher at $5.16.“Right now the market feels good about itself, and is focusing on signs of stabilisation rather than the negatives,” said Paul Miller, a managing director at FBR Capital Markets.Wells Fargo remained resolutely lower however as the prospect of further credit losses negated the impact of encouraging revenues, with analysts warning much of the income from mortgage refinancing would not be repeated. Its shares ended down 3.6 per cent at $24.45.Bank of New York Mellon also lost ground after reporting earnings slightly below expectations, falling 6.2 per cent to $27.32.The markets followed several banks and bounced back during the day.“Even if you have a few people hitting the “sell” button on results, there are others underneath willing to buy the dips,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The markets were also helped by optimism on housing after figures showed an unexpected rise in home prices in May.Mr Bernanke told the Senate he saw a “levelling-off” in house prices, although he added that foreclosures could yet pressure them again.KB Home gained 6.1 per cent to $15.03 while Lennarrose 7.7 per cent to $10.62 and DR Horton climbed 5.6 per cent to $10.38.Starbucks led the consumer sector higher after cost cuts helped it swing to a profit and beat analysts’ forecasts. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $17.39.Resilience in consumer spending helped Applereport much better earnings than expected, with sales and profit margins both beating expectations. The stock picked up 3.5 per cent to $156.74.“The consumer is responding to Apple’s product introductions as well as price cuts, which is a good sign for the rest of the market,” said Bill Shope, an analyst at Credit Suisse.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent lower at 954.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 8,881.26. But the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 1,926.38.Newspaper stocks performed well after Media General reported a quarterly profit and said declines in advertising revenue were beginning to ease. The company’s shares rose 84.3 per cent to $4.33.Of the blue-chip newspaper publishers, the New York Times Company, which reports results today, rose 3.1 per cent to $6.62.PepsiCo slipped as its quarterly revenues disappointed. Even though the company topped earnings expectations, the shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $55.89.In the technology sector, the shine from Apple’s results was dulled by disappointment over results from AMD, the microchip maker.Sliding sales saw the company miss estimates, and the shares gave up 13 per cent to $3.55.But Yahoo was able to overcome weak advertising revenues and beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings. Its shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $17.37.Boeing was the latest Dow component to beat its earnings estimates as it saw growth in its defence programs, but the shares fell 2.4 per cent to $42.Eli Lilly and Pfizersaw mixed fortunes even after both drugmakers reported better earnings than expected and raised their full-year forecasts.Eli Lilly fell 1.9 per cent to $33.79 while Pfizer picked up 1.1 per cent to $15.87.
583;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-16T21:14:42Z;Overview: Investors receive mixed economic messages;;Amid uncertainty across financial markets on Thursday, Wall Street rallied in late trade, as further earnings reassurance from the banking sector tempered mixed economic data and unsettling news for hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized US companies.“It appears that reports of commercial lender CIT Group probably not receiving a federal bail-out in the US has led to a slight pause in the recovery in risk appetite witnessed in recent trading sessions, or at least provided some cause for profit-taking,” said Samarjit Shankar, director of global strategy at Bank of New York Mellon.Analysts at Strategas Research said the US government’s decision was grounded in a belief that CIT did not pose a systemic risk to the financial system or the broader economy.“The assumption underlying this action is that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Treasury have enough tools to support the credit market,” said Daniel Clifton at Strategas.“However, the risk is for significantly higher unemployment if this calculation is wrong – but if correct, and there’s an orderly bankruptcy, it would likely be viewed as very bullish in the short term.”There was better news from JPMorgan as the US bank unveiled a jump in second-quarter earnings, underlining the brighter picture in the sector painted by Goldman Sachs’s sparkling figures this week.Further encouragement came from fresh signs that China was rebounding from the global downturn as the country’s stimulus package helped bolster domestic demand in the face of sliding exports.China’s economy grew by 7.9 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 6.1 per cent growth in the first three months of the year.But many analysts remained concerned about asset bubbles developing, which might push the central bank to tighten policy.“Chinese policymakers have succeeded in reversing the slowdown in growth, but looking forward the main question is how long Beijing will continue to keep policy very accommodative,” said Brian Jackson, senior emerging markets strategist at RBC Capital Markets.“The accelerator is clearly working well, but at some stage the brake will need to be used.”The forecast-beating Chinese data followed on from an upbeat assessment of the US economy by the Federal Reserve late on Wednesday.But figures yesterday painted a more mixed picture of the US as the Philadelphia Fed said factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region had contracted for a tenth successive month, offsetting a broadly positive report on claims for jobless benefits.The uncertain mood among US investors left riskier assets showing mixed performances.US equities had a choppy morning, but rallied into the close with the S&P 500 gaining 0.9 per cent.European stocks gained ground for a fourth successive session as the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.4 per cent to its highest close for a month.Asian stocks were helped by the Chinese growth data, with the Nikkei 225 Average rising 0.8 per cent.Credit spreads came under some early pressure amid concerns about the impact of a potential bankruptcy at CIT. The investment-grade Markit CDX North America index was unchanged 131bp late yesterday.In commodities, the benchmark US oil price eased back slightly but held above $61 a barrel, although base metals retained a firm tone.Gold ended the European session barely changed.Risk appetite was also mixed in the currency markets as the dollar index touched a six-week low, before rallying modestly, but the yen – widely seen along with the dollar as a haven in times of turbulence – broadly gained ground.The New Zealand dollar fell back after Fitch Ratings downgraded its outlook on the country’s long-term sovereign credit rating.US government bonds rebounded strongly after three days of selling, supported by the concerns about CIT.The yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 4bp at 3.56 per cent. In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield fell 6bp to 3.32 per cent.

585;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-10T16:13:11Z;BNY Mellon caught up in $4bn Jakarta lawsuit;;Bank of New York Mellon and Indonesia’s Bank Danamon are being sued for $4bn in Jakarta, and for an unspecified amount in London, for their actions in a $125m dispute between Thailand’s prominent Chearavanont family and international bondholders.The case highlights the perils international investors face protecting their legal rights in Indonesia.The country has this year become extremely popular for Asia-focused capital market investors due to its first quarter 4 per cent economic growth and stable political environment.Four Jakarta court filings, obtained by the Financial Times, show four companies controlled by the Chearavanont family are each suing the banks, and thus effectively the bondholders, for $1bn for “causing very large losses to the claimants” for seizing their assets after allegedly deciding without proof that the companies were in default of their obligations to the bondholders.The companies – Red Dragon, Regent Central International, Charm Easy and Surya Hidup Satwa – are also each seeking $1m per day for late payment of any damages.The defendants, who say the action is “unwarranted”, are unlikely to have to pay any damages if they lose. According to someone close to the case, the banks have indemnity from the seven bondholders, who are international entities, mostly based in Asia.The case began in July 2007 when the four companies pledged about $1bn worth of shares in Central Proteina Prima, a Jakarta-listed company that owns one of the world’s largest shrimp farms, to guarantee $200m in secured exchangeable bonds.Their troubles began last year when CP Prima’s share price plunged.Efforts to restructure the deal failed and bondholders ordered Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee, and Danamon, the security agent, to seize the collateral because they believed the companies had defaulted.The bondholders then owned 70 per cent of CP Prima. But they have been unable to take control of the shares. In May CP Prima completed a rights issue, which diluted the bondholders’ stake to below 40 per cent.This occurred in spite of the four companies and CP Prima promising in agreements seen by the FT not to do anything that would undermine the bondholders’ stake. CP Prima said it believes it is not party to the case.Lawyers representing the plaintiffs declined to discuss the case.Todung Mulya Lubis, the bondholders’ Jakarta lawyer, said the lawsuits are “ridiculous”.Bank of New York Mellon told the FT: “We believe [the case] is unwarranted and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”Danamon said the bank would follow the US bank’s lead.Red Dragon and Pertiwi Indonesia, another Chearavanont-owned company, are suing in London. Peter Laskey, the lawyer representing them, said he was not authorised to discuss the case.
586;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-09T15:07:07Z;European bank tensions threaten euro;;Worries over the European banking sector have risen to their highest level since March and could put increased pressure on the euro according to the world’s leading custodian bank.The Bank of New York Mellon, which looks after funds for central banks, pension funds and asset managers, said its own flow data showed net outflows from German bonds for the first time since mid-March.Indeed, the pace of outflows from German bonds seen over the course of the past week has been similar in size to that seen in early March when concerns over the European banking sector were at their height.BoNY Mellon said it also tracked outflows from Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Belgian and Greek bonds.Concerns over the eurozone banking system were triggered in February after a report from Moody’s, the ratings agency, argued deteriorating economic conditions in emerging Europe would place downward pressure on local banks and was likely to spill over to their parents in western Europe. The report said the countries most at risk as Austria, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and Sweden, which together accounted for 84 per cent of the exposure to a slowdown in emerging Europe.Although those fears subsided as global equities rallied from multi-year lows in March, Simon Derrick, head of currency research at BoNY Mellon, said it was clear that worries over the European banking system had not gone away.Indeed, on Tuesday Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an executive board member of the European Central Bank, said European banks were facing difficulties in their medium to long-term funding because confidence in the markets had not returned.Mr Derrick said in the past, it was easy for investors, such as reserve managers, to allocate funds towards the eurozone because they did not have to worry about the credit risk involved.“Investors are clearly having second thoughts about their exposure to the region,” he said. “We are become increasingly bearish on the euro.”
587;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-08T11:03:56Z;Nordic clearing house drives Nasdaq OMX changes;;Nasdaq OMX plans to expand its Nordic clearing business into the rest of Europe as the transatlantic exchange group seeks to take advantage of the increasing appetite for clearing amid the re-regulation of the financial sector.Bob Greifeld, chief executive, said the group aimed to expand into pan-European derivatives clearing using its existing Nordic clearing house, part of Nasdaq OMX Derivatives Markets, which offers trading in Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Icelandic, Russian and Baltic derivatives.“We really want our derivatives clearing capability to be European. It’s important for our Nordic clearing house to become a European clearing house,” Mr Greifeld said in an interview at Nasdaq OMX’s London office.He said the aim was to have “5 per cent of European [derivatives] clearing” by early next year.OMX is already withdrawing from EDX, a joint venture derivatives exchange operated with the London Stock Exchange, and which trades Scandinavian derivatives.“We certainly have plans to introduce additional products,” Mr Greifeld added.Nasdaq OMX has launched a series of clearing ventures in the past 18 months, including IDCG in December last year. “That’s [clearing] really our major focus,” Mr Greifeld said.The group is also working on a new US equities clearing house, to compete with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the sole US clearing house for equities.LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearer, is already the dominant clearer of interest rate swaps.Its SwapClear unit clears more than half of all interest rate swaps in 14 different currencies, of which 36 per cent is denominated in euros, 33 per cent in dollars and the rest in yen and other currencies.Nasdaq rival the IntercontinentalExchange is already working with a group of key banks that use OTC credit default swaps on a clearing mechanism for such contracts.Industry experts say that for an exchange-driven OTC clearing mechanism to be successful, exchanges should bring in the biggest users of OTC products as co-investors.Nasdaq paid $85m last year for its stake in IDCG. It has so far cleared few contracts.Last week, Nasdaq agreed to sell a minority stake in the venture to Bank of New York Mellon.Mr Greifeld said IDCG was open to other investors.Asked why it was taking time to grow volumes on IDCG, Mr Greifeld said: “We are in the process of aligning with our customers. We are taking an OTC product and putting it in a futures wrapper. The clearing and settlement systems are not accustomed to this.“We will be in a position to be properly connected with our customers by the end of the third or fourth quarter.”
588;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-07T22:23:12Z;Bank’s decision a bonus for City;;Canary Wharf and the City of London have not been spared the impact of the recession as vacancy rates have risen rapidly and rents have fallen. So Nomura’s decision this week to consolidate its 4,000 employees in the Square Mile was a much-needed bonus for the City and a blow to Canary Wharf’s leasing market.Almost 1.7m sq ft of office space is available for letting across the 15m sq ft Docklands estate, according to property agent Knight Frank. This represents a vacancy rate of 11.6 per cent, a sharp jump from 7 per cent last quarter.The official occupancy rate of the Canary Wharf Group remains at just under 96 per cent but additional space is available to be let directly from occupiers and other owners of buildings on the estate. Knight Frank said a similar vacancy rate of about 11.6 per cent applies to the City of London office market, amounting to 13.4m sq ft.According to a survey by Drivers Jonas, the property consultants, this will increase significantly following the completion of about 4m sq ft of offices now under construction.Just 300,000 sq ft was let in the first quarter, although the second quarter was boosted by a large letting to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, taking the half- year total to more than 1m sq ft.Average prime market rents in the City are about £42.50 per sq ft, a decline of more than third from the peak in 2007. Equivalent space in Canary Wharf has been valued at £35 per sq ft, according to Drivers Jonas, down from a peak of £47.50 per sq ft.The Canary Wharf Group has generally been able to keep supply more in line with demand, normally letting buildings before beginning construction but the severity of the downturn has caused problems.Morgan Stanley surprised the market In January, by announcing that it would vacate one of its three buildings, losing 345,000 sq ft, but keep two others of 1m sq ft. That is dwarfed by the loss of the Lehman Brothers teams, although the rent is guaranteed for four years by AIG, the insurer.Agents said other banks seeking to sublet parts of offices include Citigroup, Bank of America, Bank of New York and JPMorgan, which owns the empty Bear Stearns building.Bank of America is also said to be debating a move to the City headquarters of Merrill Lynch.The estate is still building and striking deals. Sources said there was interest in the Morgan Stanley building, while construction has started on a new skyscraper for JPMorgan.
589;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-07-06T12:59:24Z;How far can sterling run?;;"Back in January when the pound stood at a 23-year low of $1.39, Jim Rogers, the Singapore-based investor, said the UK economy was finished and expected sterling to fall to parity against the dollar.But less than six months later, sterling has hit $1.67, an eight-month high against the dollar, feeling the benefits of renewed appetite for investment risk amid hopes the global economy is about to turn the corner back towards growth.Can the pound continue this resilient path given fiscal, financial and political uncertainties surrounding the UK economy?Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon answers your questions on the dramatic rally in sterling, its likely impact on the UK economy and its relation with other currencies below.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Given the overwhelming response, it was impossible to answer all questions received, but we hope the selection presented here covers most areas of interestWhat is your view on the UK ever joining the euro. Is it any more likely under a new administration and any views on the level, higher or lower than current rates around 85p?
Craig Black, MonacoSimon Derrick: Craig, As you rightly highlight, UK membership of the euro will ultimately come down to a political decision. Moreover, given that there are high profile supporters of membership in each of the three main political parties, there are a number of possible pro-membership outcomes from the upcoming general election.As one example, a poll in The Independent at the start of June indicated that if Alan Johnson had replaced Mr Brown as PM, the Conservative Party would have found itself six seats short of a majority in a hung parliament (were the election to have been held then). Such an outcome would, in turn, have raised the prospect of a deal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats to keep the Conservatives out.Although Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable has said he does not back joining the euro for the moment, leader Nick Clegg told the FT at the start of this year that joining the single currency would ”anchor” the UK economy and protect it from ”dangerous” currency flows. Given this, I could certainly imagine that one of the outcomes of a Lib/Lab pact could have been a decision to push for euro membership. I’m pretty certain that the readers of this Q&A could put together a number of other potential outcomes from the upcoming general election themselves that could have a similar outcome.As for the entry level, following the UK’s experiences in the mid-1980s (when sterling was shadowing the deutschmark) and early 1990s (when sterling was briefly a member of the Exchange Rate Mechanism), politicians and advisors are aware of the dangers of joining at the wrong level. Given this I would argue that the long-term average against the euro of around 69p would be the most appropriate entry level. I have an important additional point to make, however, before we leave this topic. It seems to me that the current level of euro/sterling now has more to do with unwarranted euro strength than sterling weakness per se (the pound is trading around its long run average against the dollar). As a result, this doesn’t seem to be a particularly appropriate time to be considering membership.More generally, it also seems to me that the UK has benefited considerably over the past two years from standing outside the euro. Not only have we been able to craft a monetary policy that was tailored for the particular needs of the UK economy but also, sterling was able to weaken on the currency markets at exactly the point that it was needed to provide a competitive boost. In contrast, it is all to easy to see the problems that euro membership has brought for nations such as Ireland and Spain. I therefore remain to be convinced of the positive economic benefits of joining the euro."
590;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
591;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-30T18:30:14Z;DTCC looks for central role in clearing trades;;At the sharp end of Manhattan island, near Wall Street, an important player in the business of clearing and settling trades is fighting for a large role in the planned revamp of the financial system.Last year, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, settled a staggering $1.88 quadrillion – a million billion – in transactions across a range of asset classes.Indeed, so large are its operations the DTCC uses eye-catching images to convey their size. A recent annual report notes that a one-mile stretch of beach, 100ft wide and 1ft deep, contains close to a quadrillion grains of sand.But while the “quadrillion” tag might seem more than enough to guarantee the DTCC a central place in the future shape of the US financial system, the current political environment is leaving it – like almost every institution – gearing up for a fight.With the Obama administration having recently released a blueprint for reforming the financial system, it is clear that a tussle is breaking out between exchanges, dealers, politicians and investors about who should control trading and settlement flows.And while the DTCC could benefit from some of those battles, it could also potentially lose out from some of the proposals floating about. One idea is that credit derivatives should be placed on a central clearing platform that is not automatically linked to the DTCC.This month, the DTCC expressed concern in Congressional testimony about regulatory efforts to impose a central counterparty, or CCP, for standardised over-the-counter derivatives trades at the expense of the DTCC’s warehouse.“In the event of a firm failure, a central repository ensures that regulators can see the underlying position data from a central vantage point,” says Donald Donahue, chairman and chief executive of the DTCC. “We support the idea of central counterparty clearing of OTC derivatives … but we still want clearers to feed back these trades into the warehouse.”In many respects, this proactive lobbying role is not something that comes naturally to the DTCC. The body was set up 1999 through the merger of the Depository Trust Company and the National Securities Clearing Corp – two companies that emerged in the 1970s as Wall Street struggled with the paperwork of processing equity trades.The DTCC is owned by banks, broker/dealers, mutual funds and other financial institutions, and excess revenue from transaction fees are returned to its member firms.Partly because of that complex ownership pattern – and its near-monopoly position in many corners of the US market – the DTCC has often been perceived as a sleepy, bureaucratic organisation, rather than a nimble business.In the past two years, however, the group’s activities have suddenly shot into the spotlight in a manner that few inside – or outside – the DTCC foresaw. That was partly because it played a crucial and stabilising role last year in the wake of Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy, the collapse of AIG, the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the demise of Bernard Madoff Investment Securities.For example, the DTCC unwound more than $500bn in open trading positions across equities, mortgages and Treasuries between Lehman and a multitude of other banks and investors, without incurring losses for the various counterparties.“DTCC is a firewall to stop contagions, in the event of a firm failure, across each of the financial asset classes we support,” Mr Donahue says.However, it was arguably the DTCC’s move in November 2006 to start warehousing a record of credit derivative trades that played the most significant role in bolstering the teetering financial system last year. The trade information warehouse for credit derivatives provided regulators with a record of trades.Last October, the DTCC decided to inform the market that, based on its warehouse records, the exposure to Lehman’s was close to a net notional value of about $6bn. This was done to stem speculation that the credit derivative exposure from Lehman was $400bn.Subsequently, when the Lehman exposure was closed out, the actual value was $5.2bn.“The move to publicly disclose the gross notional values of outstanding credit default swap contracts in the wake of the Lehman bankruptcy last October played a critical role in calming the financial markets,” said Mr Donahue.Mr Donahue says the move was a “transformative moment” for the organisation. “We realised that creating this type of transparency would be an important tool in helping regulators and the public at large better understand the OTC derivatives market.”In spite of that seeming success, the DTCC fears that efforts to create a plethora of central clearing houses could undercut its position. Consequently, it is trying to convince US politicians that it is essential to ensure that any future clearing house remains tightly entwined with the DTCC.At the same time, the group is trying to spread its wings by moving into another crucial area of infrastructure, the tri-party repurchase or repo market.During the credit boom, US investment banks relied heavily on overnight repo funding. Lenders of cash, including money market funds, used the custodial clearing banks, the Bank of New York Mellon and JPMorgan, to provide dealers with cash in exchange for collateral.As the New York Fed, in conjunction with the clearing banks and dealers, looks at ways of improving the system, Mr Donahue says having the buy side as members of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation will allow the DTCC to extend the benefits of a CCP to all parties in tri-party repo transactions.“We are looking at how to expand the safeguards of our existing structure for both tri-party and bilateral repos,” he says.
592;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-30T18:21:21Z;BoNY Mellon takes stake in IDCG;;The Bank of New York Mellon announced on Tuesday that it had taken a stake in a derivatives clearing house in a sign that the push by regulators for tougher standards governing over-the-counter derivatives is shaking up the industry.BoNY Mellon has taken a strategic minority investment in International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), which clears and settles interest rate swap contracts and other fixed-income derivatives contracts.IDCG is a majority-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq OMX.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Besides the equity stake, BoNY Mellon will extend its securities servicing products, including margin and collateral management, to IDCG.BoNY Mellon is a substantial global clearer of securities and plays a significant role in custodian services between investors and other banks.”This strategic partnership with Nasdaq OMX provides our buy side and sell side clients with a flexible platform that meets their derivatives trading, clearing and servicing needs,” said Gerald Hassell, president of BoNY Mellon.The investment and collaboration comes at a time when the OTC derivatives market is undergoing close scrutiny by regulators.The recent proposals for reform by the Obama administration envision that OTC derivatives be cleared though a central counterparty, which is seen as boosting transparency.Last week, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said the regulator wanted to mandate the use of central clearing and exchange venues for all standardised derivatives.“The timing of this strategic investment reinforces the strength of our clearing house model,” said Bob Greifeld, chief executive officer of Nasdaq OMX.Last month, NYSE Euronext and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation announced a joint venture to clear US fixed income derivatives, which they hope to be operational in the second quarter of 2010.
593;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Recession worries rattle world markets;;Equities, commodities and emerging market currencies suffered hefty losses on Monday as risk averse investors shifted to the perceived safety of the dollar, the yen and government bonds.“Risk aversion has resurfaced as market participants take profits on riskier exposures amid the World Bank’s downward revision of its global growth forecast for 2009,” said Samarjit Shankar, director of global strategy at Bank of New York Mellon.“Renewed concerns about the extent of the ongoing global recession and the sustainability of the green shoots of recovery have combined with the instability unfolding in Iran and North Korea to lend an air of pessimism to investor sentiment.”The World Bank said it expected the global economy to shrink by 2.9 per cent this year, compared with a previous estimate of a 1.7 per cent contraction.The cautious mood among investors was intensified by uncertainty ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting.The downgrade overshadowed further signs of ­optimism from surveys of corporate sentiment in Germany and Japan.Germany’s Ifo institute said that its business ­climate index rose to 85.9 this month from 84.3 in May, ahead of expectations and the highest reading since November. The Ifo expectations index rose to 89.5 from 85.9, although the current conditions reading slipped from 82.5 to 82.4.“A sharp increase in Ifo expectations has never failed to be accompanied by a sharp increase in German industrial production growth rates,” said Frank Øland Hansen, senior economist at Danske Bank. “We are confident that it will happen this time too.”Gabriel Stein at Lombard Street Research said: “It is difficult to escape the feeling that German businesses may be too optimistic in their expectations that the rest of the world once again will pull Germany out of recession,” he said.Leading manufacturers in Japan were much less pessimistic about business conditions in the three months to June as exports improved, according to the government’s Business Outlook Survey.Capital Economics said the report had allowed it to firm up its forecast for the second-quarter Tankan confidence survey from the Bank of Japan, released on July 1.The BOS report offered some support to Asian equity markets, with the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo edging 0.4 per cent higher and Hong Kong rising 0.8 per cent.But there was a much more bearish tone in Europe and the US.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index tumbled 2.8 per cent to its lowest close since mid-May.The S&P 500 closed down 3.1 per cent, below 900 for the first time this month, and under its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a highly bearish indication of sentiment.Credit spreads widened sharply, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits rising 27 basis points to 765bp.Commodity prices fell across the board, with oil sliding below $67 a barrel and copper falling to a three-week low. Gold eased 1.2 per cent to $920 an ounce.Emerging market stocks and currencies suffered broad losses, with the Russian Micex index sliding 7.8 per cent – taking its fall from its 2009 peak to more than 20 per cent.The Brazilian real fell 3 per cent to trade below the R$2 per dollar mark for the first time since late May.As riskier assets retreated, the safety appeal of government bonds, the dollar and the yen was enhanced.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell 9bp to 3.70 per cent as dealers focused on the risk trade and not a record $104bn of note auctions this week.In Europe, the yield on the 10-year Bund fell 5bp to 3.45 per cent and that on the 10-year UK gilt lost 6bp to 3.75 per cent.On the currency markets, the yen rallied across the board, even gaining ground against the broadly firmer dollar.The euro retreated ahead of the European Central Bank’s first-ever 12-month liquidity operation on Tuesday amid talk of foreign banks tapping the auction and converting the proceeds from euros into other currencies.
594;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-21T21:31:33Z;Lehman creditors in fight to recover collateral;;Leading hedge funds have been buying up Lehman Brothers’ debt in the hope that the bankrupt investment bank’s estate will be able to win court battles to recover billions of dollars in collateral held by competitors with whom it did business.The bulk of the potential claims stems from JPMorgan Chase’s role as a clearing bank for Lehman in the repurchase – or repo – markets. Lehman borrowed heavily in the repo markets – in which banks receive overnight loans in return for pledges of collateral – a practice that left it susceptible to a loss of confidence.Lawyers for the Lehman estate and for unsecured creditors are trying to determine whether Lehman surrendered too much collateral, at the expense of other creditors, to JPMorgan and other lenders. The Lehman estate has already filed a complaint against Bank of America for allegedly improperly seizing $500m collateral. Lehman and the other banks declined to comment, citing confidentiality concerns.Lawyers say it is not unusual for unsecured creditors, such as hedge funds, to pursue secured creditors, such as the banks, in the courts. Unsecured creditors hold Lehman debt that once had a face value of $80bn but now trades at about 15 cents on the dollar.The Lehman saga shines a light on the complicated relationship that existed between Lehman and JPMorgan. JPMorgan served as the clearing bank for Lehman in the repo market and as one of the two clearing banks – the other was Bank of New York Mellon – for the New York Federal Reserve Bank’s credit facility for securities firms.In addition to serving as its clearing agent, JPMorgan was also Lehman’s biggest counterparty on billions of dollars of derivatives trades. In such transactions, each side tots up its net exposure every night, demanding additional collateral when the amounts owed exceed a certain threshold. If Lehman defaulted, according to the agreements, the value at which these trades were automatically closed out was determined by JPMorgan.These multiple activities exposed JPMorgan to potentially massive losses if Lehman failed. Unsurprisingly, in the days leading up to Lehman’s bankruptcy filing on September 15 there were a series of crisis meetings between the banks.On August 26, JPMorgan reworked its existing credit agreements with Lehman so that the parent guaranteed the obligations of the broker-dealer and also provided collateral to secure that guarantee. Because the collateral the parent supplied JPMorgan involved very customised structured securities, which did not trade, JPMorgan relied on Lehman’s own values “initially”, a person familiar with the thinking at JPMorgan says. Lawyers familiar with the matter say about 30 per cent of the collateral Lehman pledged was illiquid, hard to trade and therefore hard to value.Then, on September 4, JPMorgan was briefed on Lehman’s upcoming earnings results and was told it expected to report a $4bn loss, according to people familiar with the matter.Five days later, JPMorgan signed another agreement with Lehman in which the Lehman parent’s guarantee covered not just its failing broker-dealer but all Lehman entities and covering all transactions, including the large book of derivatives trades.After Lehman filed for bankruptcy at the holding company level, it lost its ability to trade with most counterparties in the repo market. The Fed stepped in to provide it with emergency funding in exchange for collateral, the value of which was estimated by JPMorgan. JPMorgan advanced an initial $87bn to Lehman to help it unwind repo arrangements on the day it filed.People familiar with JPMorgan say the bank gave the Fed access to its internal values for most of the securities pledged by Lehman, although some of those estimates reflected third-party input. In cases involving collateral unique to Lehman – for example customised and non-traded securities – Lehman provided price estimates to the Fed. Several people familiar with the matter say the overall values for the Lehman collateral reflected JPMorgan’s calculations.The creditors’ committee now alleges that JPMorgan had collected about $17bn in collateral from Lehman in the first two weeks of September 2008. A filing on behalf of unsecured creditors states that as of the Friday before the bankruptcy petition, the Lehman holding company had “at least $17bn in excess assets in the form of cash and securities” that were held by JPMorgan and subsequently frozen by JPMorgan.“JPMC’s refusal to make those assets available to [Lehman] and its subsidiaries in the days leading up to the bankruptcy filing may have contributed to Lehman’s liquidity constraints,” the filing claims.People familiar with JPMorgan say the bank is unsure how the $17bn figure was arrived at. JPMorgan’s own calculations suggest the bank received only $13bn in additional collateral payments, according to people familiar with the matter.A bank spokesman declined to comment.Separately, creditors are looking into whether banks and other counterparties including JPMorgan closed out derivatives transactions with Lehman at values that were unfavourable to the bankrupt investment bank.
595;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-21T21:31:33Z;Fed plans repo markets revamp;;The US Federal Reserve is considering dramatic changes to the giant repurchase – or repo – markets where banks around the world raise overnight dollar loans.The plans include creating a utility to replace the Wall Street banks that handle transactions, people familiar with the matter say.The Fed’s deliberations are partly motivated by concerns that the structure of the US overnight repurchase market may have exacerbated the financial turmoil that accompanied the failure of Lehman Brothers in September last year.Fed officials plan to meet next month with market participants to discuss reforms.People familiar with the Fed’s thinking say it is looking into the creation of a mechanism to replace the clearing banks – the biggest of which are JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon – that serve as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders.“The Fed is raising questions about whether the system really protects the interests of all participants,” says one person familiar with the Fed’s thinking.In the repo markets, borrowers, such as banks, pledge collateral in return for overnight loans from lenders, such as money market funds.The clearing banks stand between the parties, providing services such as valuing the collateral and advancing cash during the hours when trades are being made and unwound.Fed officials fear this arrangement puts the clearing banks in a difficult position in a crisis. As the value of the securities falls, clearing banks have an obligation to demand more collateral to avoid losses. But in doing so, they could destabilise a rival.“The clearing banks fear the positions of the investment banks are so large that a default would be difficult for them to manage,” the person familiar with the Fed’s thinking said.“[Everyone] is thinking about how to remove conflicts of interest of the clearing banks and the investment banks so that the investment banks aren’t vulnerable to a sudden restriction of credit.”The system’s complications were evident during Lehman’s collapse. JPMorgan, one of Lehman’s biggest trading partners, acted as its clearing bank in the repo market and – along with BoNY Mellon – served as the clearing bank for the New York Federal Reserve’s credit facility for securities ­companies.Lawyers for the Lehman estate and for creditors have raised questions about whether JPMorgan acted too aggressively in seizing and marking down Lehman’s collateral.Hedge funds have bought Lehman debt on the theory that the estate can claw back some of that collateral in court.Citing confidentiality concerns, JPMorgan declined to comment.The Fed hopes to have a new repo system in place by October, when its credit facility for securities companies is to close.
596;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-14T22:06:31Z;Who’s watching the chest-beating CEOs?;;It is survival of the fittest in the M&A jungle and the sound of chief executives beating their chests is reverberating through the markets.Too scared to overpay for acquisitions during the leverage bubble, these CEOs are emerging from their caves to hunt down deals. But who is watching them? It seems regulators have stress-tested everything except chief executives’ urge to merge.Take Bob Kelly. Less than a month after passing the US government’s stress test, the chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon is planning to do deals.Already in charge of the world’s biggest custody manager, Mr Kelly wants BNY Mellon to become even bigger and now is the time to pick up a bargain.That is when dangerous decisions are made. Yet, there is no stress test for this.Research published on Monday by the Cass Business School shows that buying distressed companies does not necessarily lead to higher returns. So, short of testing CEOs for their hormone levels to see how high their testosterone gets before doing a deal, independent directors of predatory companies need to educate themselves about M&A.In trying to understand the collapse of the banking system, regulators have focused on the excessive risk-taking by traders, the crazy compensation packages of CEOs, and the apathy of investors. They have not looked at the governance surrounding deals – largely because this should be the job of the acquirer’s independent directors. They don’t dig deeply into the future cash flow of the acquisition target. Or demand a timeline for achieving the targeted synergies.So few non-executives understand M&A enough to know the right questions to ask their CEOs, that they automatically default to rubber stamping deals.It is no good relying on the bankers advising on the deal. Their job is to map out various routes a CEO can take, but the ultimate decision rests with the board.Nor should asking for a fairness opinion be enough to approve a deal. Banks that carry deals out only get paid if they complete, and they can only complete if they say a transaction is fair.At the end of last year, the components of the S&P 500 had $654bn of cash to spend. CEOs who thrive on running large companies are hardly likely going to elaborate on the risks of spending that on deals.It is the job of those around them to tame that beast.lina.saigol@ft.com
597;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-12T20:00:51Z;Fink finally realises his strategic dream;;For Larry Fink, persistence paid off. Eight years after he first approached Barclays with the idea that his BlackRock group could buy Barclays Global Investors and turn itself into the biggest money manager in the world, Mr Fink has realised his dream.It was a logical deal in strategic terms – following a pattern in recent years for banks to seek to sell off their asset management businesses.But it was also a deal of its day. The truth is that BlackRock’s chief executive has the turmoil in the banking sector – and Barclays’ need to boost its capital strength – to thank for triggering this transaction.Back in January, two months before the rest of the world, Mr Fink heard that Barclays was looking to sell iShares, the exchange-traded fund arm of BGI.On a business trip to the Middle East, he put in calls to both Bob Diamond, the head of Barclays’ investment banking and asset management operations, and John Varley, Barclays’ chief executive. The snag was that Mr Fink wanted the whole of BGI, not just iShares.The project to sell iShares, which firmed up during the first quarter of the year, coincided with an intense period of scrutiny from the Financial Services Authority, the UK regulator. The FSA was conducting an extreme stress test to satisfy itself that Barclays did not require extra capital and did not need to be pushed into the government’s Asset Protection Scheme, an insurance vehicle to ringfence losses on toxic assets.Determined to keep the bank free of government influence, a fiercely independent Mr Varley pointed to the fact that it had already embarked on a sale of iShares, potentially boosting its capital ratios by realising a multi-billion dollar gain.By mid-March, Barclays was able to announce that it had already “held discussions with a number of potentially interested parties” – enough, apparently, to convince regulators that the bank had the capacity to build a sufficient capital buffer. It passed the stress test.It was CVC, the private equity firm, rather than BlackRock, that by early April had struck a $4.2bn deal to buy iShares. But the transaction was ill-fated.Under a “go-shop” provision of the CVC-iShares deal, Barclays had given itself an opportunity to do better. “When we signed the go-shop deal, we already had it in mind to go back to BlackRock,” said one person involved in the negotiations.By last weekend, it was clear that its inkling had turned into a near-certainty. Mr Fink had spent the previous week in the Middle East, lining up funding from sovereign wealth contacts.Back in New York, talks with Barclays, which had first emerged only a couple of weeks earlier, were progressing well, helped by a long-standing relationship between Mr Fink and Mr Diamond.Both men have been leading Wall Street figures for years. Both were considered for the chief executive job at Morgan Stanley in 2005, when John Mack ultimately took the job.Although both sides had agreed the broad terms of the deal, it proved tricky to finalise. A 10 per cent-plus spike in the BlackRock share price helped delayed the sign-off by a day.Bank of New York Mellon’s presence as a stalking horse also played a part in helping inflate the final deal price from $12bn early in the process to $13.5bn, according to people involved in the talks.When the negotiating team – Messrs Diamond and Fink in New York and Mr Varley and Rob Kapito, BlackRock’s president, in London – finally signed off on the deal late on Thursday, Mr Fink was able to celebrate nailing an asset that he admits to having “always coveted”.Meanwhile, an exhausted Mr Varley rubberstamped the deal at a late-night board meeting at Barclays’ Canary Wharf headquarters. At 2am he made his weary way home to Hammersmith, west London, confident that, whatever the strategic merits of BGI, he had turned an undervalued asset into a £5bn ($8.2bn) capital cushion.
598;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-09T21:46:44Z;Pound responds to upbeat housing data;;The pound advanced yesterday as UK housing data provided a further sign that the worst of the economic slowdown might be over.Figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors revealed that house prices fell at the slowest annual pace since November 2007, echoing other recent indicators that the UK housing market might be stabilising.Sterling also benefited from signs that political turmoil in the UK was easing. Parliamentarians from the Labour party gave beleaguered prime minister Gordon Brown their backing in spite of the ruling party’s heavy defeats in recent local and European elections.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said that given the pound historically reacted poorly to changes of leadership in the UK’s ruling party, sterling’s rally was understandable.He said, however, that Mr Brown’s weakened political position had raised the risks for the pound in the longer term.“The risk is that a fresh leadership challenge could emerge in the latter part of this year, when members of parliament have potentially much less to lose,” said Mr Derrick.“In light of this, we are starting to find ourselves questioning our longer-term bullish stance on the pound for the first time in quite a while.”Late in New York, the pound was up 1.7 per cent to $1.6321 against the dollar, gained 0.6 per cent to Y159.03 against the yen and climbed 0.4 per cent to £0.8624 against the euro.Meanwhile, the dollar came under pressure, giving up some of the sharp gains it made in the wake of Friday’s stronger-than-expected US jobs report.The employment data had boosted Treasury yields, lifting the dollar as expectations increased that the Federal Reserve would start increasing interest rates as early as the year-end. However, the dollar’s rally stalled yesterday as investors questioned the likelihood of a change in US monetary policy so soon.“The view that the market may have been premature in pricing in Fed rate hikes before the end of the year has been circulating,” said Jane Foley at Forex.com.The dollar fell 1.3 per cent to $1.4079 against the euro, lost 1.3 per cent to SFr1.0778 against the Swiss franc and dropped 1.1 per cent to Y97.43 against the yen.Elsewhere, the Swedish krona rallied as Latvia indicated that it was prepared to make painful budget cuts to appease the International Monetary Fund.The Swedish krona rose 1.1 per cent to SKr10.7987 against the euro and gained 2.3 per cent to SKr7.6709 against the dollar.Central and eastern European currencies also gained on the news. The Hungarian forint rose 1.7 per cent to Ft281.28 against the euro, while the Polish zloty climbed 0.6 per cent to 4.4910 zlotys against the single currency.
599;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-09T20:51:29Z;US investors turn to materials and energy stocks;;"US equities edged upwards but stayed within the narrow range of the past six sessions as rising commodities and a slipping dollar failed to spark significant buying.Metal producers fared well as prices for their products rose. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 4.4 per cent to $58.96 while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, advanced 3.5 per cent to $11.15.Steel makers were also helped by rising metals prices, as well as analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded shares in US Steel and AK Steel but downgraded those of larger rival Nucor.Shares in US Steel rose 7.9 per cent to $37.82 and AK Steel jumped 9.8 per cent to $19.10. Nucor’s gains were limited to 2.1 per cent at $47.76.But the strength in materials stocks was countered by weakness from the consumer sector, where Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer company, warned that the short-term environment remained challenging. P&G’s shares dropped 1.4 per cent to $52.41.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent up at 942.43, close to its highest finish of the year, and the Nasdaq Composite index finished 1 per cent higher at 1,860.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction lower at 8,763.06.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford, said investors were looking at the dollar and commodities prices for signs of inflation to interpret the future direction of interest rates.“The market can only focus on one thing at once, and all week that has been whether interest rates will rise,” she said.Texas Instruments provided a boost for the technology sector after the microchip manufacturer said demand for its products would drive second-quarter sales and profits higher than previously forecast. The shares gained 6.3 per cent to $21.02.Bank of America added to the optimism in the sector when it said Microchip Technology‘s orders from China had improved, causing the bank to raise its price target on the company to $23. Microchip Technology’s shares picked up
6 per cent to $23.07.Other microchip manufacturers also benefited. Texas’s larger rival Intel advanced 3.1 per cent to $16.42 while Applied Materials gained 1.6 per cent to $11.03.News that the government will allow 10 of the country’s largest banks to repay a total of $68bn from the troubled asset relief programme failed to give the sector a lift, even though banks that repay the money will free themselves of some government involvement in matters such as hiring and executive pay.Several banks confirmed that they were on the list and some said they planned to repay the money soon. Morgan Stanley said it would repay its $10bn infusion in full but its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $30.98.Capital One, the credit card company, said it expected to repay its Tarp money “within weeks” and its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $24.05. American Express said it had also received approval, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $26.93.US Bancorp lost 0.9 per cent to $18.18 after it said it would also repay Tarp money but that the process of doing so would cost the bank $153m in second-quarter earnings.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said: “Financial stocks have been held back by the threat of inflation. We are seeing the negative effects of too much good economic news.”Some of the positive effect on financial stocks from the Tarp news was also damped by the congressional panel overseeing the Tarp process, which said the stress tests should be repeated on tougher terms.BlackRock continued its gains of the previous session as the company closed in on the purchase of Barclays Global Investors for a sum of $12bn-$13bn to create the world’s biggest money manager.The purchase would mean BlackRock has beaten off late competition for the unit from Bank of New York Mellon, and the company’s shares lifted 7.6 per cent to $182.14.BoNYM’s shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.79, as it confirmed it was also on the list of those allowed to repay Tarp funds."
600;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-08T20:44:29Z;Wall Street recovers losses in late trade;;US stocks staged a late recovery on Monday to end roughly where they were at the end of the previous session after a day spent almost entirely in negative territory.The equities markets opened lower on worries that interest rates might rise later in the year and stall an economic recovery.“Bond yields have been on the rise and that spells weaker than average performance,” wrote analysts at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch. “We found that stocks deliver below-average performance when interest rates rise dramatically.”Don Galante, senior vice-president of fixed income at MF Global, agreed, saying: “The risk is that such a rise could shut the economic recovery down.”But financial stocks, which were the only sector to perform well throughout the day, led a late reversal while the market waited to see which banks would be first to be allowed to repay money from the government’s troubled asset relief program.The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs would be named on the initial list. But while JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $35.39, Goldman gave up 0.4 per cent to $148.35. Citigroup rose ahead of an expected swap of preferred shares into common stock.The Financial Times reported over the weekend that the bank’s plan to raise $33bn in capital had been postponed after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threatened to lower a crucial financial health rating as part of the regulator’s drive to replace Vikram Pandit, chief executive. Citigroup shares closed 1.2 per cent higher at $3.42.The paper also reported that Bank of New York Mellon and BlackRock were competing to buy Barclays Global Investors.BlackRock, which Reuters reported was the frontrunner with an offer of about $12bn, gained 3.4 per cent to $169.36, while BNY Mellon picked up 1.1 per cent to $28.54.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 939.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on which Travelers and Cisco made their first appearance, replacing Citigroup and General Motors, edged a fraction up to 8,764.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,842.40.Materials were the biggest drags on equities markets as the price of oil and metals dropped.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 1.2 per cent to $56.48, while Nucor, the steelmaker, dropped 1.6 per cent to $46.76.Multinationals felt the effect of the strengthening dollar. McDonald’s was a particularly heavy faller as the company warned that exchange rates could cost the company 20 cents per share for the year.The warning negated the impact of a stronger-than-expected rise in global sales for May and the company’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $58.72.General Mills, which makes food brands such as Cheerios, gained 4 per cent to $54.22 after the company said 2009 earnings would be several cents better than forecast.Apple shares lost 0.6 per cent to $143.85 even though the company unveiled a new iPhone and a new Mac operating system at its annual developers conference.There had been early rumours that Steve Jobs, chief executive, might make an unexpectedly early return from ill health at the conference.However, the company said his return was not expected until the end of June.Meanwhile Palm, Apple’s latest competitor in the smartphone market, retreated 6.5 per cent to $12.16 in spite of reports that the company’s Pre phone had sold out at some stores during its launch over the weekend.Investors were concerned the new iPhone would reassert Apple’s position in the market.Verisign, which operates internet domain names, fell more than any other on the S&P after a court on Friday allowed an antitrust suit against the company which claims its pricing of the .com and .net domain names is artificially high.The company’s shares slumped 14.2 per cent to $19.90.
601;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-08T07:24:12Z;BlackRock seeks to beat BNY Mellon to BGI;;BlackRock is scrambling to seal the purchase of Barclays Global Investors and see off an 11th-hour challenge from Bank of New York Mellon.Barclays is expected to take a decision early this week on who should buy the BGI unit. If BlackRock did succeed, people in London briefed on the deal said Barclays was likely to take a stake of up to 20 per cent in the US money manager.The UK bank has long sought a stalking horse as it tries to maximise value and raise badly needed capital.It has resisted taking government money and has passed UK regulatory stress tests without official aid.Larry Fink, BlackRock’s founder and chief executive, was understood to have been in the Middle East last week to arrange possible commitments to help fund the deal from sovereign wealth funds, including the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Qatar Investment Authority.If successful in the auction, BlackRock would already have all the equity and debt financing in place with no rights offer planned, people familiar with the company said.BlackRock is still considered the most probable buyer, but if it fails to come up with an attractive price within the next few days, BNY Mellon could step in.BNY Mellon was formed in 2007 from the merger of the Bank of New York and Mellon and is already one of the world’s largest institutional money managers, with $1,200bn in assets under management.Bob Kelly, chief executive of BNY Mellon, said last month the bank’s acceptance of US government money under the troubled asset relief programme did not preclude it from making acquisitions.Talks of a full takeover of BGI follow Barclays’ decision to sell iShares, part of its asset management business that specialises in exchange traded funds.Barclays last month agreed to sell iShares for $4.2bn to CVC Capital Partners, the private equity group. But as a provision of that deal, it can seek counter-bids for iShares and other related businesses until June 18.Barclays is keen to attract higher bids for BGI, with suggestions that the $10bn price tag for the business could ultimately be closer to $13bn.If BlackRock does succeed, Bob Diamond, president of Barclays, plans to join the board of the US group.Barclays confirmed in a statement on Monday that it has had discussions with a number of parties, including with BlackRock, about both iShares and BGI.“The discussions are not yet concluded and there are a number of significant open issues which could affect the nature and terms of any transaction,” it said.Barclays said it would update the market further upon the conclusion of the ”go-shop” process it agreed with CVC and in any event no later than 19 June 2009BlackRock confirmed that it was in discussions with Barclays about a potential purchase of BGI, including iShares, but cautioned that “the negotiations are ongoing and there is no certainty that any transaction will be agreed upon or, if agreed upon, completed.“Shares in Barclays opened 0.6 per cent higher on Monday at 285p.
602;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-07T08:24:57Z;Depositary banks in protest over EU plans;;"Investors in Ucits funds will face the prospect of higher fees if European Union plans to tighten up the rules surrounding safekeeping of fund assets become law, industry figures believe.In one of his last acts as EU internal market commissioner, Charlie McCreevy dropped a bombshell when he said “stringent proposals” to regulate the depositary banks that service hedge funds could also be extended to cover the Ucits mutual fund
universe.The proposal has provoked a storm of protest in the arcane depositary world. “The whole thing is frankly confused,” says Bob Penn, a partner at Allen & Overy, a law firm closely involved with the industry.“It is wrong to take a piece of hedge fund legislation that has not been consulted on and is, at best, badly drafted and, at worst, unworkable, and apply it to Ucits. This is classic Trojan horse tactics by the European Commission.”Like much of the confetti of legislation being dropped on the financial services industry, the roots of this particular regulatory escapade lie in the twin tremors of Lehman Brothers and Bernard Madoff.Investors in a hedge fund run by Paris-based Day Trade Asset Management were no doubt perturbed to learn that €3.2m (£2.8m, $4.5m) of their assets were held by Lehman, the fund’s prime broker and sub-
custodian, when it collapsed last autumn.Fortunately for them, French law was on their side. In April, a French court ordered Société Générale Securities Services, which acted as the depositary bank for the fund, to reimburse Day Trade AM, ensuring investors did not lose out, a ruling that sent a “shudder” through the European custody industry.“The markets were horrified,” says Mr Penn. “People had not believed for a moment that a depositary would be held liable for failure of a prime broker appointed by the fund, as they ultimately were.”In contrast, investors in the Luxembourg-domiciled LuxAlpha Sicav, which not only acted as a feeder fund to Mr Madoff’s Ponzi scheme but used a Madoff entity as sub-custodian, were left empty-handed. The Grand Duchy’s legal framework did not require the depositary, UBS, to bail out investors in the event of the sub-custodian’s failure.Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, complained at the time that supposedly EU-wide rules were being interpreted differently in different member states.These sentiments have clearly wheedled their way into the mindset of the European Commission, which is complaining of an “unlevel playing field”, meaning “some EU investors in Ucits funds are better protected than others”.In essence, the Commission says the proposals it outlined in its recent draft alternative investment fund managers directive should be extended to Ucits.This would mean depositaries would have to be credit organisations, based, authorised and supervised in the EU; there would be clear provisions on the extent to which they can delegate their task; and there would be strict conditions under which assets could be entrusted to depositaries outside the EU.The existing Ucits directive merely says that the depositary must be liable in accordance with national law in the event of “unjustifiable” failure to perform its obligations, wording described as both “flawed” and “probably quite deliberately unclear” by Mr Penn.Depositary banks are worried about the new proposals, which they say would render them liable for losses outside their control.“As a depo bank we have to make sure that we do our job and if we outsource some of the work we make sure that that entity is a reasonable entity to perform that duty,” says Paul Bodart, executive vice-
president responsible for the operations of Bank of New York Mellon in Europe.“Asking me to replace securities that have gone bust or to replace fraudulent securities – I think this is not my responsibility and certainly I’m not paid for that.”The nub of the problem is that even the giant “global” custodians are present on the ground in relatively few countries; no bank is believed to have custody operations in more than 40 jurisdictions. This means they are often forced to outsource to non-affiliated organisations.Although the custodians freely accept they have a due diligence role to perform in selecting these sub-depositaries, they argue they should not be held liable for any failings by these entities, especially as the thin margins in the depo industry– typically 2 to 10 basis points of assets – leaves little fat to cover any unexpected claims.If the current proposals see the light of day, Mr Bodart says: “I would have to review whether this business would make sense for us, given what we get as revenues. I may have to do more to protect my risk and liabilities. I might not service all the funds that are investing in difficult assets.“What if a prime broker goes bust and derivative contract cannot be acted upon. Why should I, as a depo bank, be responsible for that?” asks Mr Bodart. “To go beyond oversight responsibility is not realistic. The industry will resist this change.”Mr Penn believes depositaries would have to find other ways of indemnifying their exposure.“The best thing would be to try and find an insurance policy and charge that to the fund…that would be a cost that would be passed to the investors,” he says.There are other concerns too. Deb Yamin, senior vice-president of State Street’s alternative investment solutions business, is worried about potential changes to the role of the valuator.At present, custodians work with investment managers to determine the value of the assets, but the asset manager takes the final decision and retains the legal liability in case of disputes. This may change in the new regime.“We help our clients but the ultimate responsibility is with the investment manager or the board of directors. It needs to be clarified who has the liability. We believe it should be, as now, the fund,” says Ms Yamin."
603;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-05T20:04:53Z;Diamond eyes seat on BlackRock board;;Bob Diamond, the high-profile president of Barclays, plans to join the board of BlackRock if the US money management group reaches agreement to buy Barclays Global Investors, the UK bank’s asset management business.BlackRock was on Friday night in the final stages of agreeing a $10bn-plus (£6.3bn) deal to buy BGI from Barclays, which would allow the UK lender to strengthen its balance sheet. However, the talks could yet stall after Barclays demanded at least $12bn.Two people familiar with the bidding process suggested there had been tension between Barclays and BlackRock over the price.That delayed the finalising of a deal, with one person warning it could take several days to strike a compromise.Barclays could end up retaining a stake in BGI.Mr Diamond, who is also BGI chairman, would stay at Barclays and would join BlackRock as a non-executive director. He has been active in talks with BlackRock, even though he is in line for a big payout if the deal goes ahead. He stayed out of talks to sell iShares, an exchange-traded funds business that is part of BGI, due to conflicts of interest.A person familiar with the talks said Mr Diamond was the “father of the strategy”, and that “it would be odd if Bob was not involved in the talks” to sell such an important part of Barclays.However, another person involved in the deal questioned why Mr Diamond could take part in talks over the whole of BGI when he had not been able to do so on iShares alone.Barclays is keen to attract bids for BGI to improve on the $4.2bn sale of iShares it agreed last month with CVC Capital Partners, the private equity group.The bank can seek counter-bids for iShares and other related businesses until June 18, under a “go shop” provision of that sale, but it must pay a $175m break-up fee to CVC if it chooses another bid.Other asset management groups rumoured to be examining an approach for BGI include Bank of New York Mellon. People familiar with the talks said there were still “multiple parties” considering bids for BGI.Larry Fink, chief executive and founder of BlackRock, has built the company into one of the world’s biggest money mangers with $1,280bn of assets.Mr Diamond has 200,000 BGI shares, which could be worth $23.9m if BGI were sold, although the strike price at which he bought them is unclear.

604;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-03T22:07:39Z;Dollar fights to regain lost ground;;The dollar on Wednesday clawed back some of the heavy losses suffered in recent sessions as some of the world’s largest reserve managers lent support to the US currency.Concerns over the dollar’s reserve status have increased in recent weeks, with some observers predicting a fundamental shift away from the US currency.“It appears to us that we have entered a new era in financial history: an era in which certain governments are seriously deliberating the dollar’s hegemony as a reserve currency and even its stability over the longer term,” said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.But analysts said reports that officials in India, Japan and South Korea saw no alternatives to the dollar as a reserve currency, and that the Chinese central bank saw US Treasury holdings as “a partnership”, supported the dollar yesterday.Geoffrey Yu at UBS said it appeared efforts by Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, to preserve the current detente between the US and its largest creditors had succeeded.“Markets are still trading off the debasement theme but expectations of a mass exit away from the greenback need to be scaled down,” he said.The dollar’s rally came ahead of a visit by Barack Obama to Saudi Arabia, where the status of the dollar and its relation to oil prices are expected to be on the US president’s agenda.Late in New York, the dollar was up 1.2 per cent at $1.4138 against the euro, had gained 1.8 per cent to $1.6278 against the pound and climbed 0.2 per cent to Y95.91 against the yen.The dollar also benefited as equity markets were driven lower by profit-taking, forcing investors to shy away from risky strategies and fuelling haven demand for the currency.The dollar rose 2.8 per cent to $0.7976 against the Australian dollar, climbed 2.7 per cent to C$1.1103 against the Canadian dollar and gained 0.9 per cent to SFr1.0713 against the Swiss franc.Meanwhile, the Swedish krona moved sharply lower as worries intensified concerning the exposure of the country’s banking system to problems in the Baltic region.The krona lost ground after a Latvian government debt auction failed, which raised concerns over the sustainability of the country’s currency’s peg to the euro.Elisabeth Weise at Action Economics said the market remained on tenterhooks about potential currency devaluations in the Baltic region, particularly given the exposure at Swedish banks.“The auction result brings this event risk closer to fruition,” she said.The Swedish krona lost 1.8 per cent to SKr10.9176 against the euro and fell 3 per cent to SKr7.7202 against the dollar.
605;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-06-01T15:32:56Z;Insight: Geithner must reassure China;;US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner’s first official visit to Beijing comes at a critical time for both the US credit markets and the US dollar. After a nine-month period that saw an unambiguous reaffirmation of US government debt and the dollar as the haven assets of choice, the recent relaxation in market tensions has seen a marked deterioration in the performance of both.Indeed, May saw the largest monthly decline in the dollar index in nearly a quarter of a century while the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note has risen to the highest level seen in nine months. It is against this backdrop that Mr Geithner faces the task of persuading his hosts to continue investing a healthy proportion of their ever-expanding foreign exchange reserves in the US.The relationship between Mr Geithner in his current role and the Chinese authorities started on a low note in January, when he informed senators that: “President Obama – backed by the conclusions of a broad range of economists – believes that China is manipulating its currency.” China’s response to this was unambiguous, with Premier Wen Jiabao making it clear over the next month and a half that he was increasingly concerned about its exposure to the US. This culminated in his comments at the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress that “we have lent a massive amount of capital to the United States, and of course we are concerned about the security of our assets. To speak truthfully, I do indeed have some worries. So I hope through you to again call on the United States to maintain its creditworthiness, abide by its commitments and ensure the security of China’s assets”.Since then both sides have softened their tone somewhat, likely realising they would both end up losers if the situation were to deteriorate further. The final publication of the US Treasury’s FX report in April saw the US backing away from labelling China as a “currency manipulator” while Chinese officials have refrained from making further comments about US creditworthiness. Nevertheless, with the US fiscal deficit projected to hit 12.9 per cent of gross domestic product this year and the dollar under pressure, Mr Geithner needs to assure his hosts that the Obama administration will help protect the value of China’s investments. More particularly, he will need to convince them that the new administration truly believes in its “strong dollar” mantra and that it will shrink the budget gap as quickly as possible.This appears to be exactly what Mr Geithner has attempted to do this weekend, highlighting on a number of occasions over the past few days his commitment to a strong dollar and to bringing “our fiscal deficits down over the medium term to a sustainable place, to a sustainable level”. Whether these assurances will prove sufficient for the Chinese authorities remains to be seen, although Mr Geithner must hope that the response is a little more positive than the laughter that yesterday greeted his assertion to a student audience in Beijing that: “Chinese financial assets are very safe.”So far the response from the financial markets to Mr Geithner’s comments have been roughly the same as that of the audience of Chinese students, with the dollar coming under increasing pressure against a wide range of currencies while Treasury yields have moved higher. Moreover, with equity markets continuing to rise, it is likely that international investors will further unwind the haven positions they built up in US Treasury instruments and the dollar unless they are given a convincing reason to do otherwise.In the absence of rather more robust verbal support from the US Treasury (possibly implying the threat of intervention as Mr Geithner’s predecessor Hank Paulson did so effectively last summer), the Federal Reserve and, perhaps, even other members of G7, the dollar may find itself back where it was last summer against a wide range of currencies. The knock-on effect for the export-oriented sectors of the equity markets in nations such as Germany and Japan would, presumably, be just as negative.The writer is head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon
606;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-05-28T21:58:32Z;BNY Mellon to repay Tarp fast;;Bank of New York Mellon wants to be among the first round of US banks to repay Tarp money to counter concerns that clients could think the aid is a sign of weakness, and because it does not want restrictions on compensation.Bob Kelly, chairman and chief executive, said: “I think [Tarp] . . . helped shore up the banking system, but the reality is for most players in the US, you don’t need the Tarp money anymore. It did its job, let’s repay it and get it over with.”He hoped to return the money in June or July, he said, joining the line of banks, led by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, clamouring to return the money.BNY Mellon is one of the world’s largest asset managers, and also one of the largest custody banks.“We never actually needed the . . . money in the first place, we’ve been profitable every quarter and we have the strongest debt ratings in the nation by Moody’s, and second highest by S&P. So . . . even if we repaid the preferred stock, we would still have one of the highest capital ratios in the nation,” said Mr Kelly.BNY Mellon, which had $3bn in Tarp money, recently raised $1.2bn in equity. It also cut its dividend, in part to repay Tarp, Mr Kelly added.“It was actually a competitive advantage for us last fall, particularly outside of the United States. Then that slowly changed over the course of the winter and spring of this year, as the requirements became a little more onerous.“First, our clients, particularly outside the US, see it as a negative to still be a Tarp recipient. They view all Tarp recipients as weak, and perhaps vulnerable to future Federal government actions that could affect profitability, or the competitiveness of the industry.“Second, we would actually make more money, the Tarp money is relatively expensive because it’s 5 per cent after tax, and our earnings and EPS (earnings per share) would actually go up slightly by repaying it.“Third, I worry about retaining the best people, and if we were going to have artificial constraints upon compensation, that could affect people joining us, or potentially leaving us. I don’t want to take that risk,” he said.He said the bank would also like to return its FDIC-guaranteed funds, for the same reason.The bank, which had put half of its short-term assets in liquid instruments during the financial crisis, began in March shifting some into longer-dated securities as markets and confidence began to recover, he said.However, he said he did not see what the future drivers of growth would be, because consumers still had too much debt, and the government had large deficits.Mr Kelly said the US mortgage system was the worst in the English-speaking world, and needed to be overhauled before the next financial downturn.National standards and national registration of mortgage brokers were among the changes that would help clean up the system, he said.www.ft.com/vftt
607;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-05-15T17:39:35Z;An offer US banks could not refuse;;It was an offer the banking titans gathered in Washington could not refuse.As the chief executives of the nine biggest financial groups in the US, including Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, sat in a conference room of the Treasury building last October, the message was loud and clear.After outlining the government’s plan to purchase up to $250bn in the preferred stock of banks, Hank Paulson, then-US Treasury secretary, was quick to emphasise that dissenters would not be tolerated.“We don’t believe it is tenable to opt out,” he told the bank executives, according to official documents released this week. His comments pre-empted opposition from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo that regarded themselves as healthy enough not to need government money. “If a capital infusion is not appealing, you should be aware that your regulator will require it in any circumstance.”The strategy devised by Mr Paulson – a former Goldman chief who had known many of the executives in that room for years – was simple: all nine institutions had to take the money to minimise the stigma that came with a government bail-out.A month earlier, Mr Paulson had used similarly forthright tactics to “persuade” BofA and Merrill Lynch to merge and, before the end of the year, he would again have to call upon his tough streak to convince BofA not to walk away from that deal.But in October, the matter was settled within hours.The nine – Citi, BofA, JPMorgan, Wells, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, State Street and Bank of New York Mellon – all signed up for the federal aid with each chief executive filling in the blanks on the Treasury’s templates by scrawling his institution’s name and the amount it would receive.That hastily-arranged meeting on October 13, when funds from the troubled asset relief programme (Tarp) were first earmarked for stakes in the country’s banks, was a milestone in the crisis, and maybe, US financial history.The government’s direct intervention in some of the largest publicly-traded companies sparked fears of a “creeping nationalisation” and underlined just how troubled many of the banks were.In the ensuing months, as public outrage at Wall Street’s “fat cats” mounted, Congress imposed draconian pay curbs and greater oversight on Tarp recipients, prompting many of them to scramble to repay the money. The events set in motion by that one-hour meeting will take years to unravel but the preparations for such a momentous event appeared to have been less than thorough.The documents, obtained by the conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act, offer a glimpse of the chaos.As of the morning of the meeting, key staffers did not even known which banks were supposed to attend. “Can someone tell Michele Davis [Mr Paulson’s spokesperson], [Kevin] Fromer [the then head of legislative affairs] and me who the ‘Big Nine’ are?” James Wilkinson, Treasury’s chief of staff wrote to colleagues.The logistics of the meeting were also troublesome. Early in the morning, Lew Kaden, a senior Citi executive, e-mailed Treasury officials to ask what the meeting was about. “If this is a briefing of industry group, I don’t think VP [Vikram Pandit, Citi’s chief executive] can go back to DC.” Mr Kaden was given no details other than to get his chief over to DC.At least one executive appeared eager to meet with Mr Paulson. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief, arrived at the building early, unsettling secret service agents trying to clear the area.
608;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-05-12T20:46:30Z;Defensive stocks stem bank losses;;Defensive stocks helped Wall street erase early losses on Tuesday as investors repositioned themselves following the dramatic recent rises in some of Wall Street’s most beaten down sectors.Healthcare and consumer staples companies, which are traditionally more stable during a recession, were the biggest winners as investors sold riskier assets, which have enjoyed a steep run up in the past two months.Healthcare stocks were led higher by Pfizer, which gained 5.5 per cent to $14.93, after Credit Suisse said the company may boost its dividend in the future following its purchase of rival Wyeth.Other coroporate giants such as Coca-Cola and Philip Morris also performed well, rising 3.9 per cent to $44.40 and 3.2 per cent to $41.84 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 908.35 points, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 8,469.11 points. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,715.92 points.The markets had been led lower by financial and retail stocks, but rallied as investors looked to take advantage of lower share prices.“Every time we’ve had a dip, we’ve seen people stepping over each other to get into the market,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams.Banks fell despite positive comments from Federal Reserve governor Ben Bernanke on the results of the tests on balance sheets and a major asset sale by Bank of America to help cover its capital shortfall.The bank was reported to have raised $7.3bn by selling a large stake in China Construction Bank, helping to plug the $33.9bn capital shortfall revealed by the tests. But its shares continued to lose ground as investors took profits following the stellar rises in financial stocks over the past two months. BofA lost 5.3 per cent to $12.26.Other banks were also lower even though Mr Bernanke said the reception of the tests was “encouraging”, and the Financial Times reported that the subsequent share offerings would make banks hundreds of millions of dollars in underwriting fees. Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $3.66 and JPMorgan lost 1.3 per cent to $35.36.Bank of New York Mellon also dropped after it became the latest bank to announce a rights issue following last week’s tests. The bank said that it would look to raise about $1bn in order to pay off government bail-out funds, even though the tests revealed no capital shortfall. Its shares slid 3.8 per cent to $28.43.It was the fifth bank to go to the equity markets this week after similar announcements by BB&T, Capital One, KeyCorp and US Bancorp on Monday.US Bancorp said it raised $3.5bn from selling equity and debt on Tuesday, and may sell an additional 20.5m shares to accommodate for extra demand. Its stock fell 3.3 per cent to $17.89.“Share prices have got ahead of fundamentals, and while that feels uncomfortable right now, it usually happens when the market is coming up from the bottom,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.Banks were not the only ones to tap the market for funds.Ford announced it would issue 300m common shares and use part of the proceeds to pay off its healthcare obligations to the United Auto Workers union as part of a recently agreed deal. The company tumbled 17.6 per cent to $5.01.Its rival General Motors slumped 20.1 per cent to a historic low of $1.15 after six executives sold their shares in the carmaker. Its market value is now only $702m.Meanwhile, the telecoms sector continued to gain ground the day after Virgin Mobile’s US business reported much better than expected profits and said average revenue per user would rebound in the second half of 2009.Other companies gained from the optimism surrounding the sector, with Verizon rising 2 per cent to $30.40 and AT&T climbing 1.5 per cent to $25.73.Elsewhere, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, called stories the company was look to purchase German software company SAP a “random rumour” and said his company had nearly finsihed making job cuts.The company issued debt for the first time on Monday to take advantage of its current low price. Its shares gained 3 per cent to $19.89.
609;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-05-07T23:27:34Z;Stress tests separate sick from healthy;;A not-so-stressed Wall Street executive recently said the US government’s insistence that none of the 19 banks involved in its stress tests should fail was like a Starbucks’ menu.“There are no shorts, just talls, grandes and ventis,” he said, putting a sarcastic gloss on the authorities’ attempts not to single out the weakest links in the US financial chain.Yet when the widely leaked outcome of the tests was released on Thursday, it crystallised the yawning gap between the healthy and the sick among US banks.The institutions found to be needing capital – which include Bank of America, Wells Fargo and several regional banks – will have to shed assets, sell shares and, possibly, accommodate the government as a main shareholder.Their travails will give an added edge to those that emerged as winners from the exercise – groups such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, American Express, US Bancorp, State Street and Bank of New York Mellon that do not need extra­ ­capital.Citigroup is somewhere in the middle, as its capital requirement of $5.5bn is lower than most, although only because it has already agreed to receive a $52bn equity boost from the government and other shareholders.Morgan Stanley was in limbo after the tests found it needed $1.8bn in additional equity but it moved quickly to close the shortfall, announcing a $2bn share sale and a $3bn debt offering on Thursday night.A clearer separation between the haves and have-nots could reshape the competitive landscape in US banking, at least in the short run. Many of the healthier banks plan to press home the advantage by repaying the government aid they received under the troubled asset relief programme as soon as possible.Executives at those banks are champing at the bit to free themselves from the federal shackles on pay and other issues that came with billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, has branded Tarp “a scarlet letter” for its recipients, vowing to return the funds “tomorrow” if allowed.The US Treasury and the Federal Reserve have imposed some conditions on Tarp repayment – namely, that banks raise debt that has not been insured by the government. But JPMorgan, Goldman and now Morgan Stanley have done that.Indeed, some bankers expect Goldman, which also raised $5bn in equity last month, could announce it is sending a cheque for $10bn to Treasury on Friday, when it hosts its annual investor meeting. Goldman did not comment.Regardless of the timing of Tarp repayment, Goldman and JPMorgan are likely to court corporate clients in an attempt to lure them away from weakened arch-rivals such as Citi and BofA, which now owns Merrill Lynch.“After the stress tests, there will be a blitz from banks keen to remind people they are open for business while their competitors are licking their wounds,” said a Wall Street executive.
610;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-05-07T21:22:00Z;US stress test results table;;The US government on Thursday directed the nation’s largest banks to raise just under $75bn overall, following a three-month “stress test” designed to measure each bank’s ability to withstand an economic downturn. The table below shows how much extra equity each bank must raise.The banks are listed by the size of their total assets, from largest to smallest.Sources: SNL, CreditSights, US government stress test resultsAll figures in US$bn.

611;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-05-06T20:30:27Z;US stocks jump ahead of stress tests;;"US banking stocks jumped on Wednesday amid a flurry of reports about how well companies had fared in the government’s stress tests on banks’ balance sheets, the results of which are due on Thursday.Reports said that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, American Express and Bank of New York Mellon would all pass the tests without needing to strengthen their balance sheets. That sent KBW index of banks up 10.8 per cent.Bloomberg reported that Citigroup needed $5bn, half the level reported on Monday. Its shares leapt 16.6 per cent to $3.86.Meanwhile, the New York Times said the government had asked Bank of Americato raise nearly $34bn, more than triple the figure previously reported.But the bank overcame this to find gains after Citigroup said it was unlikely to need to issue new shares. Its stock jumped 17.1 per cent to $12.69, taking its weekly gains above 45 per cent.Wells Fargo, which Bloomberg said would need $15bn, rose 15.6 per cent to $26.84.Regions Financial provided a microcosm of the volatility in the market, slumping 11 per cent in eight minutes after the Wall Street Journal said it also needed new capital. But its shares then surged, and closed
6.2 per cent up at $5.83.“The fact that Timothy Geithner [the Treasury secretary] waited three months after announcing the stress tests to give us more details worked out well. They have been able to come up with some solutions so banks are not going to have to go out and issue new shares,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers.But Robert Loest, fund manager at Integrity Mutual, said: “Investors are deluded. The stress tests were done by the banks themselves, and any rational person would be suspicious of that.”The reports helped extend early gains which came after labour market data from ADP said that companies laid off nearly 25 per cent fewer workers in April than expected.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Lincoln National, the life insurer, soared after its quarterly results. The company made a loss after writing off some of the value of its annuity business, but investors focused on unexpectedly strong operating profits, sending its shares up 33 per cent to $15.57.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 1.7 per cent higher at 919.53 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,512.28 points.But the Nasdaq Composite index, which has outperformed the other two this year, gained only 0.3 per cent to 1,759.10 points as some investors looked to bank profits.Energy companies were behind financial stocks as the day’s biggest gainers as the price of oil rose to new highs for the year. Chevron gained 3.6 per cent to $68.11.The better-than-expected data from ADP matched a report from outplacement group Challenger that also suggested the rise in unemployment was slowing.It also added to confidence the economy might be slowing its contraction after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week.But Pulte Homes and Centex, the rival homebuilders that are due to merge, announced heavier losses than expected amid rising unemployment and foreclosures. Pulte lost 8.1 per cent to $11.31, while Centex slid 8 per cent to $10.78.The homebuilding sector took another knock after a report from Zillow.com said nearly a quarter of US homeowners owe more than their properties are worth.There was some good news for consumer stocks however as Disney reported a narrower fall in earnings than expected. The company’s profits dropped as it had to offer discounts to attract visitors to its US theme parks, but the fall was not as bad as analysts had predicted, and its shares rose 11.8 per cent to $25.87.Dow Chemical also fell after it announced it was offering $1.63bn in common stock to pay back debt owed following its acquisition of rival Rohm & Haas. It slid 7 per cent to $15.19.General Motors was one of the day’s heaviest fallers ahead of its earnings report on Thursday. The company is expected to make an eighth straight quarterly loss, and is reportedly facing opposition to its restructuring plans from the United Auto Workers union. Its shares tumbled 10.3 per cent per cent to $1.66."

614;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rise in risk appetite hurts yen and dollar;Australian dollar near seven-month peak;Foreign exchange investors ventured from their havens this week as global equities rose more than 11 per cent in April, their best month in 22 years, and left the yen and the dollar weaker.Swine flu fears sent investors running to low-risk currencies, such as the Japanese yen, on Monday and Tuesday. But sentiment improved later in the week, driving investors to emerging markets and high-yield currencies.With Mexico at the epicentre of the flu outbreak, the peso was volatile. The first cases were discovered in the country’s capital causing the currency to drop more than 5 per cent against the dollar on Monday. But it recovered some poise and eventually stood 3.9 per cent lower on the week at 13.8450 pesos.The stellar performance on global equity markets during April drove risk sentiment higher and turned fortunes around on foreign exchange markets.“Once investors start to see consistent returns on equity markets on a day-for-day and week-for-week basis it encourages them to move [currencies] around more,” Simon Derrick, at Bank of New York Mellon, said.Strong stock markets paired with some better-than-expected US data led the dollar to fall 0.7 per cent against the pound to $1.4885, and 0.3 per cent against the euro to $1.3260.Robert Lynch at HSBC said: “The perceived improvement in economic and financial market conditions and the associated increase in risk appetite suggests currencies such as the dollar will underperform.”The yen, also a victim of improved investor sentiment, lost 1.3 per cent against the pound to Y147.53 and 0.8 per cent against the euro to Y131.48. The dollar rose 0.5 per cent against the yen to Y99.11.High-yield currencies rose in the later part of the week, with the Australian dollar nearing a seven-month peak. The New Zealand dollar gained also, following the decision by the country’s central bank to cut the main interest rate by 50 basis points to a record low of 2.5 per cent.The Aussie ended the week 0.8 per cent higher at $0.7293 and 2.8 per cent stronger at Y72.40. The Kiwi made a weekly advance of 1.6 per cent against the yen to Y56.48, but remained fractionally lower versus the dollar. Investors also sought out risk in central European and Asian emerging markets.The South Korean won climbed strongly on Thursday, gaining 4.4 per cent against the US dollar, the largest daily rise in almost six months. The movement came after a large capital injection into the nation’s banking system and stronger industrial production figures than expected. During the week, the won climbed 4.6 per cent to Won1,277 against the dollar and gained 6.6 per cent against the yen to Won12.8535.Meanwhile, the Taiwan dollar rose 2 per cent against the US dollar to T$33.144.Mr Derrick noted the recent performances of emerging Asian currencies relative to the strong rallies on their domestic equity markets. “China is the common theme, being either their first or second-largest export partner,” he said.The pound was boosted on Friday after the release of better-than-expected UK manufacturing data, with the pace of decline easing to its slowest in eight months.James Knightley at ING said: “While still a contraction, it does add to positive data seen elsewhere in the economy such as consumer confidence and housing data.”

The collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers alerted investors to the importance of counterparty risk, while the revelation that Bernard Madoff had made away with up to $50bn (£35bn, €38bn) in a giant Ponzi scheme thrust the importance of administrators and custodians into the spotlight as guardians of investors’ interest.In the US in particular, where many hedge funds have been self-administered without
question, the effect has been striking for hedge fund administrators and custodians.“The old system seemed to work pretty well as long as assets grew,” says Jack Klinck, head of global investment product services at State Street. “But now investors are really nervous. There’s a tremendous focus on ‘who’s your counterparty?’”Mr Klinck expects to see a number of large US hedge funds, which have until now done all their administration in-house, outsource this function in order to reassure their clients. “Self-administered hedge funds are looking like outliers now. They’re having to break their operating model.”The pressure for this change is coming from investors, according to David Aldrich, head of global investment services at Bank of New York Mellon. “They have institutional investors coming in saying ‘We want a known, credible fund administrator so if something goes wrong, we can sue them – and there’s some balance sheet behind that name’.”Mr Klinck concurs: “We’re getting questionnaires from the hedge funds’ clients. They’re doing site visits and due diligence – they want to come in and kick the tyres.”But giving away control of an internal process does not come easy to some hedge funds, used to playing everything close to their chests. Mr Aldrich says although investors are demanding some involvement of an independent administrator, the larger hedge funds are still not giving everything away.“Some want a parallel process,” he says. In effect, they allow an independent administrator to run the numbers in order to satisfy client demand, but keep on doing the work in-house as well.“They believe they understand the assets better than anyone else,” says Mr Aldrich. “The cost of doing this, while it is in the millions of dollars, is not material to their business.” He adds that even if a hedge fund were happy to outsource entirely “it’s not that easy to switch off all the accounting for $1bn”.However reluctant the hedge fund, however complicated the outsourcing operation, it seems a foregone conclusion that the vast majority of US hedge funds will move to some form of independent administration.“It’s not easy, but the alternative is a bleak one,” says Chris Adams, global product head for alternative funds at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “I wouldn’t want to be the person facing the trustees saying ‘it’s too difficult’.”Although European hedge funds have never had a tradition of self-administration, this does not mean they are unaffected by the events of the past year. They are also being scrutinised over the creditworthiness of their custodian, with implications for those
custodians.“We have a service model that’s now very much in demand,” says Mr Klinck. “We’ve gathered a lot of assets, although that’s against a lot of redemptions.“We see this as an opportunity to increase our market share. It’s about flexing our muscles a bit and taking market share from some of our weaker competitors.”Bank of New York Mellon is also licking its lips at the prospect of picking off some of the less solid competition. Mr Aldrich predicts the industry will see consolidation in the next few years, having grown at unsustainable rates for a while. “In the past, everything only went up. Profitability was there, assets were there, revenues were there. But when the value of assets falls by 40 per cent, what happens to the hedge fund administrators?“They’re struggling with the reality and perhaps looking for a white knight.” Mr Aldrich would like to see BNY Mellon in that role, but “it’s a question of timing”.He makes it clear the object of consolidation is likely to be the middle rank of administrators. Boutique HFAs, if they survive, will continue to serve a useful function for the smaller hedge funds whose business would be unprofitable for the larger companies.The industry may shift in other areas as well – there have been developments in the relationship between prime brokers and custodians, says Mr Aldrich."
616;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-21T20:39:42Z;Financials rise as Geithner calms bank fears;;US stocks rebounded on Tuesday as Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, allayed fears over the health of the banking industry.Mr Geithner told a congressional panel that “the vast majority” of banks had more capital than needed, which encouraged buyers to enter the market after Monday’s bruising sell-off, during which the financial sector dropped 11 per cent.Citigroup picked up 10.2 per cent to $3.24, helped by comments from its chief executive Vikram Pandit that it would “repay every dollar” of bail-out money. Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
617;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BGC in options hedging tie-up;;"BGC Partners, one of the largest interdealer brokers, on Tuesday highlighted how the lines are blurring between exchanges, brokers and interdealer brokers by agreeing a “strategic alliance” with BNY ConvergEx, a broker that is an affilate of Bank of New York.Under the arrangement, BGC – which acts as a broker in over-the-counter equity and index options, among other products – will use BNY ConvergEx to allow its customers to hedge their options exposures in equities.Hedging of OTC option positions in the cash equities markets is common practice but customers of interdealer brokers usually have to shop around to brokers to get their hedges done.Bryan Coyne, head of emerging market equities at BGC in London, said the arrangement meant that BGC’s customers would get access to ConvergEx’s connections with markets globally.“We will bring them clients and we share revenues; they bring us technology and infrastructure.”"
618;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-21T18:47:19Z;US custody banks hit by profits slump;;The fall in global markets during the past year has hit first-quarter profits at three large US custody banks and at BlackRock, the largest publicly traded fund manager.Custody banks hold stocks and bonds in safekeeping, and are responsible for settlement when they change hands.State Street, a custody bank but also the world’s largest asset manager after overtaking Barclays Global Investors following the sale of BGI’s iShares unit, saw profit fall 9 per cent to $476m.Assets under management fell 29 per cent to $2,000bn, while assets under custody fell 24 per cent to $11,300bn.Ron Logue, chief executive, warned that profits were likely to be down by at least 12 per cent in the coming year, indicating the worst was not over.Bank of New York Mellon cut its dividend to 9 cents a share, from 24 cents, saying that this would save $700m a year and help the bank quickly repay the $3bn it received under the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).BNY Mellon, which also has a large asset management division, said its profits fell 57 per cent to $322m.Rob Kelly, chief executive, said that “it feels like we’re at, or close to, the bottom” of the economic cycle, although he said loan losses could continue for some time.Northern Trust’s profits fell 58 per cent to $162m after its assets under management declined by 33 per cent – to $522bn – and assets under custody dropped by 29 per cent to $2,800bn.However, in the 2008 quarter it received $244m in proceeds from the initial public offering of Visa. Excluding that, its quarterly profit drop was 30 per cent. Northern Trust reiterated that it too wants to return its $1.6bn in Tarp money.Asset management firms almost never make a loss, because their revenue is derived from a fee on the money they manage. The 40 per cent drop in the Standard & Poor’s index compared with the same quarter last year has caused management fees to plunge.BlackRock’s profits fell 65 per cent to $84m. The drop was partly because of a loss of $153m from its co-investments and seed investments in its own funds.BlackRock attracted $138bn in new money in the 12 months to the end of March but its assets under management fell 6 per cent to $1,280bn, as a result of market falls. The drop was still much lower than other asset managers.
619;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-21T16:22:47Z;US earnings blunt hopes of recovery;;"A raft of US companies reported earnings on Tuesday with results that highlight how difficult the first quarter of the year has been for businesses ranging from financials to industrials, amid the worst downturn since the Great Depression.The banking sector continued to show signs of strain, dimming hopes that an end to the financial turmoil was imminent. Even after changes in accounting rules helped boost earnings at large US banks, including Citigroup and Bank of America, regional banks profits continued to suffer.“Some of the smaller banks don’t have the scale to withstand the strains in credit markets and global economic pressures,” said Joseph Brusuelas, analyst at Moody’s Economy.com, speaking generally.Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s biggest custodian of investor assets, said it was slashing its quarterly dividend as it reported profits fell by 51 per cent in the period and cut its dividend from 24 cents to 9 cents as it tried to bolster its capital base and take a step toward repaying Tarp funds.But the BoNY results left some analysts concerned about how the bank would fare in the Treasury’s stress test results. “Given that they had the lowest [tangible common equity] ratio of all 19 banks subject to the upcoming stress test, we think it is unlikely that the government will allow them to repay the [Tarp’s Capital Purchase Program funds],” said Mark Fitzgibbon, director of research at Sandler O’Neill and partners.Net income declined to $322m, or 28 cents a share, from $749m, or 65 cents, in the same period last year. The drop was worse than analysts had expected and came as fees and revenue fell 28 per cent in a volatile quarter for equity markets.But the bank had some success rebuilding its capital base during the last three months, improving its Tier 1 capital ratio to 13.8 per cent from 13.3 per cent at the end of last year, and boosting its tangible common equity ratio – a measure of financial health – to 4.2 per cent from 3.8 per cent.Earnings also suffered at US Bancorp, another large US regional bank. It reported a 50.8 per cent fall in first-quarter profits as it was hurt by higher credit costs, lower fees and more writedowns.Net income at the Minnesota-based bank fell to $529m, or 24 cents a share, from $1.09bn, or 62 cents. Revenue ticked up by 0.2 per cent to $3.88bn, but a big increase in US Bancorp’s allowance for credit losses disappointed analysts.“Credit costs continued to rise this quarter; an expected consequence of the weak economy and the primary contributor to the reduction in net income year-over-year,” Richard Davis, US Bancorp’s chief executive, said in a statement.The disappointing earnings come as Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told a Congressional oversight panel that evidence the bank bail-out had led to a credit thaw was ”mixed.”Although banks have been at the centre of the recession, industrial companies such as Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment, have been hit especially hard as the downturn spread to other parts of the economy.The Illinois-based company reported its first quarterly loss since 1992 and slashed its outlook for the year. The loss of $112m, or 19 cents a share, was fuelled largely by the costs of massive job cuts imposed during the last few months. In January, Caterpillar cut 20,000 jobs, or 11 per cent of its workforce, as orders plunged.Caterpillar’s revenue also fell sharply, declining by 22 per cent in the quarter to $9.23bn.The company, seen as a bellwether for the US industrial sector, took some comfort in the fact that its losses were due to the one-time costs associated with the job cuts. Excluding those, Caterpillar earned $237m, or 39 cents a share.Cutting its outlook, the company said it expected to earn 50 cents a share on $35bn in sales and revenues this year.”We will take action to keep Caterpillar lean, while at the same time making strategic product and operational investments to position Caterpillar for long-term success when the economy does recover,” said Jim Owens, chief executive.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks group, reported that its first-quarter profits were off by 10 per cent during the first quarter compared with the first three months of last year.Coke’s net income declined to $1.35bn, or 58 cents a share, from $1.5bn, or 64 cents. The company’s results were in line with analysts’ expectations.“While the global economic environment remains challenging, we are well positioned for long-term growth,” said Muhtar Kent, chief executive. “Our business was built for times like these.”Coke’s revenue declined by 3 per cent to $7.17bn during the quarter, but sales by volume were up by 2 per cent.In February Coke said it would raise its 2009 quarterly dividend by 8 per cent, making it the company’s 47th consecutive annual increase."
620;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-21T16:07:22Z;Icap hurt by banks’ platform;;London equity markets ended the session little changed on Tuesday after a turbulent afternoon led by the swings on US markets.The FTSE 100 closed 3.4 points, or 0.1 per cent, lower at 3,987.46. At its best level of the session the index climbed back over the 4,000 level to stand 0.7 per cent higher. At its lowest point, following poor results from Bank of New York Mellon, the FTSE 100 slid 93 points, or 2.3 per cent,Already-fragile sentiment deteriorated further in the wake of a raft of weak US bank earnings. A fresh forecast from the International Monetary Fund that financial institutions now face total losses of $4,100bn on toxic loans and other assets added to the unease.London-listed financial stocks crowded the bottom end of the market as investors continued to take news of rising bad debt levels, previously revealed in otherwise better-than-expected numbers from Bank of America.The IMF’s warning came as a powerful, fresh sign that the sector’s sustained rebound could yet be curtailed by fresh contagion from damaged balance sheets.Lloyds Banking Group was the biggest loser, down 9.1 per cent to 95p, while Royal Bank of Scotland fell 5.9 per cent to 30.6p and Barclays lost 4.8 per cent to 199p.Among insurers, Prudential lost 4.5 per cent at 363¼p, Aviva, the company behind Norwich Union, fell 7.5 per cent to 253½p, and Old Mutual shed 5.5 per cent to 56½p.Data that showed retail prices fell for the first time since 1960, underlined the perilous state of the UK economy. March’s reading on the consumer price inflation index eased to a one-year low of 2.9 per cent.But Tesco provided a little help with news that annual pre-tax profits topped £3bn, a record for the retail sector. It was also a bigger number than analysts had forecast, helping it raise its dividend by 9.7 per cent to 11.96p a share. Tesco’s stock rose 4.9 per cent to 348.3p.Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, said: “This is a red letter day for British retailing. However, the US operation is well behind on store openings with lessons having to be learnt fast and in the UK, Asda and Sainsbury’s are both growing faster.”Jonathan Jackson, head of equities, Killik & Co, said: “Tesco is a fantastic grocer, with industry-leading management.”This helped lift its rivals. J. Sainsbury was 1.6 per cent higher at 311¼p and Wm Morrison was 0.6 per cent stronger at 243p.Associated British Foods, owner of the Primark discount clothing retailer rose 4.9 per cent to 686p after it reported a lower-than-feared 2 per cent fall in interim profits of £275m and predicted better operating profit in the second half.Diageo, the premium drinks maker behind the Guinness and Johnnie Walker brands, was 1.2 per cent higher at 793½p after analysts at Bernstein raised their price target on the stock to £11.60 from £11.00.

In Hong Kong, China Southern rallied 14 per cent to HK$2.03 and China Eastern gained 16.9 per cent to HK$1.45.In Hong Kong, other shares benefited from the mainland optimism, and the Hang Seng closed 1 per cent higher at 15,750.91. Ping An Insurance gained 3.3 per cent to HK$52.70 and Bank of China rose 5 per cent to HK$2.95.Elsewhere in the region, gains were more muted. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 spent morning trading lower consumer lender Promise was under pressure after it surprised the market late on Friday by saying it was now expecting to post a Y127bn ($1.28bn) loss for the year ended March, having previously expected a profit.However, the mood improved after lunch, and the Nikkei followed the Hang Seng higher. The Nikkei 225 closed 0.2 per cent higher at 8,924.75, while the broader Topix gained 0.3 per cent to 848.30.Promise shares slid 14.4 per cent to Y1,338, and dragged its rivals shares lower as well. Takefuji lost 6 per cent to Y612, and Aiful fell 8 per cent to Y208.Toshiba’s rally on Friday after it said it would post a smaller-than-forecast loss for the year ended March was short lived. The stock fell 4.8 per cent to Y316. Nintendo dropped 3.9 per cent to Y25,110. The company is expected to raise between Y300bn and Y500bn including tapping the equity market.Autoparts maker Denso gained 4.6 per cent to Y2,380, after reports it may ask for US government guarantees on its account receivables to US automakers such as General Motors. Yorozo, another autoparts maker mentioned in the report, gained 1.1 per cent to Y855.Investors in Thailand largely ignored the apparent assassination attempt of Friday of Sondhi Limthongkul, one of Thailand’s most controversial political figures, just two days after calm was restored in Bangkok.Steelmakers gained on optimism about steel price negotiations, following reports that price cuts are smaller than initially expected. Nippon Steel gained 4.3 per cent to Y361 and JFE gained 6.9 per cent to Y3,190.The SET index gained 2.3 per cent to 467.50, its highest level since January 8.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.2 per cent to 3,769.00.

622;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-19T22:31:17Z;Europe’s rich rush for hedge fund exits;;Rich Europeans, who were the first to invest in hedge funds and once comprised the majority of investors, have been the first to exit in the downturn, according to a study out Monday.High net worth individuals last year accounted for 80 per cent – or more than $500bn – of hedge fund redemptions, though they only held two-thirds of the assets. The outflows were disproportionately European, the study by the Bank of New York Mellon and Casey Quirk, a research firm, said.“The result is not only a smaller industry, but a capital base that is more institutional and more North American,” the study said.The shift leaves US pension funds as the hedge fund stalwarts. They are likely to account for the single largest source of new capital in the next four years. Pension funds put net new money into hedge funds last year and plan to put more in again this year, according to the study based on a survey of 158 investors and industry members.Individual investors’ share of hedge fund assets has dropped from 67 per cent in 2005 to 57 per cent at the end of last year.“Future flows from European high net worth investors are highly sensitive to future returns and represent the greatest source of volatility,” the study said. “Asian high net worth investors also account for a very high redemption rate, in excess of 30 per cent, though the absolute outflow in dollars is smaller than those recorded in the larger European and North American high net worth markets. The widespread use of structured notes with automatic redemption triggers in the Asian and European markets drove these outflows.”Institutional investors led by Calpers and the Utah state pension fund have begun pushing for fee reductions and trying to renegotiate terms as they review commitments to the asset class.
623;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-12T10:38:29Z;Distressed portfolios up for inspection;;Bank of New York Mellon’s advisory business for distressed and illiquid assets has grown rapidly in its debut year.Set up last May, Global Workout Solutions had amassed $24bn (£16bn, €18bn) of assets as of March 31. All told, the Boston, Massachusetts, unit expects to be overseeing about $40bn shortly, including assets in the pipeline and the double counting of some assets common with other businesses of the bank.It has quickly become a significant component of Standish Asset Management, the bank’s fixed income cornerstone that runs $186bn of assets globally, including some shared mandates. Standish, in turn, is a part of the global franchise of BNY Mellon Asset Management.The catalyst for Global Workout was the deflating of the credit bubble surrounding the US housing market. This implosion resulted in the near-collapse of the banking system and triggered massive de-leveraging by both financial companies and consumers, leaving many asset classes in need of triage.“As the credit crisis unfolded, many investors found themselves cornered and had nowhere to turn,” says Desmond MacIntyre, president and chief executive of Standish. Commercial paper became illiquid and there was significant performance dispersion in the fixed income space. While most institutions were invested for the long haul, the pain became too much to bear for some, he says. Furthermore, valuation and pricing anomalies began to appear disconcerting to some.“We found our large and diverse client base coming to us with problems and wanted assistance to determine whether the assets they held were impaired for the short term or permanently,” says Mr MacIntyre, whose overall business has some 400 clients in 37 countries. Amid a backdrop of frozen global markets, the question became: if these assets cannot be sold, what should be done with them?Herein lay the genesis of Global Workout Solutions, a fiduciary advisor that services stressed, distressed and hard to value assets. And there’s no dearth of such paper, in the form of fixed income securities, collateralised debt obligations, structured investment vehicles and securities lending collateral pools, in the current market.Additionally, there are illiquid asset-transfers, known as payment-in-kind, that hedge funds and high-yield money market entities have made to redeeming investors.Global Workout’s client roster has expanded to include endowments, family offices, institutional investors, investment consultants and pension funds, as well as banks and insolvency practitioners. Thomas Graf, director of structured products within Standish, oversees the unit with help from 10 investment professionals.There are four components of its offering: valuation, risk management, surveillance and liquidation. From a macro perspective, here is how a workout mandate works: The unit would analyse a client’s troubled portfolio as part of what Mr MacIntyre calls “a look under the hood”. The group would scrutinise models on which assets have been valued and conduct independent pricing verification.The next step would comprise separating assets that are temporarily impaired from those that are permanently damaged. Depending on the client’s investment horizon and end goal, it would establish a multi-year management mandate, including surveillance, for those assets that can be held to maturity with the expectation of a market recovery. Finally, hopeless assets wind up in liquidation, also a process that the unit conducts.Standish’s involvement is not a mere opportunistic exercise to benefit from investors under duress, says Mr MacIntyre, but rather a process aimed at creating tailored, bespoke accounts that can meet the liquidity and investment needs of clients.As some credit markets continue to decline or remain frozen, investors face the dilemma and uncertainty of determining the true value of securities they hold, argues Mr MacIntyre. For instance, a broker may quote a price 15 points below that of industry-pricing vendors. Fair value analysis might infer another price altogether. “Our value-add is to put these prices into context and also highlight downside cliff risk and liquidity risk with securities so that clients can optimally manage their exposures,” he says.Looking ahead, Mr Graf says the advisory business continues to see significant inflows from clients who are drawn to it for its independent risk management and proprietary valuation capabilities.In its marketing pitches, it is telling prospective clients to take charge of portfolio risk by fully understanding today’s market reality. Its bottom line is: failing to act on permanently impaired assets can be catastrophic, while moving impulsively on temporarily impaired assets can be equally harmful.
624;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Tchenguiz pub group defaults on loan;;Globe Pub Company, the struggling operator owned by Robert Tchenguiz, is facing an uncertain future after the company defaulted on a £257m asset-backed loan.The default comes after the company, which owns more than 400 pubs, failed to remedy a breach of its banking covenants last month. As a result, bondholders can now seek the appointment of an administrative receiver to run the business.Should that happen, Mr Tchenguiz could face the risk of losing control of the business and see his investment wiped out.Analysts warned that it was too early to say whether the company would go the way of Laurel Pub Company, another pub business owned by Mr Tchenguiz which was put into administration last March.The Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for the bondholders, has just started the process of contacting bondholders to discuss the default. If holders of 25 per cent of the bonds agree, they can call in an administrator to run the company.A person close to Mr Tchenguiz’s camp said the Iranian-born property entrepreneur was still trying to negotiate a deal with creditors and that he had not ruled out injecting more money into the business.Globe was created four years ago after Mr Tchenguiz, through his R20 investment vehicle, acquired 360 pubs from Spirit for £345m.The estate, managed by Scottish & Newcastle’s Pub Enterprise division on Mr Tchenguiz’s behalf, is comprised mainly of pubs that are smaller-sized and less profitable than the average for portfolios of bigger rivals.Over the past year, trading has deteriorated to such an extent that the group’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the three months to the end of February stood at only £4.1m – a 35 per cent decline from the year before.Pre-tax losses nearly doubled from £2.4m to £4.6m during this period. Interest payments on the group’s debt, by contrast, was £3.4m for the quarter.The covenant breach was triggered last month after the group’s ebitda for the past two quarters fell below 1.25 times the cost of servicing its debt – the minimum allowed.The difficulties at Globe are the latest blow to Mr Tchenguiz’s pub interests. In addition to Laurel, Mr Tchenguiz is also nursing big losses on his investment in Mitchells & Butlers after he was forced to sell his 25 per cent stake in the All Bar One operator in a firesale in October.
625;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-05T07:58:38Z;Sector’s strong local links gain traction in a crisis;;"The global financial crisis has created opportunities for sub-custodians to expand their business and take market share, although they face increasing pressure to be more transparent.Colin Brooks, global head of sub-custody at HSBC Securities Services, believes, post-Lehman, sub-custodians have been able to show their worth. He says: “The strength of local presence and the value of local contacts has been particularly useful.”Having strong links with regulators and market infrastructure, such as depositories and stock exchanges, is crucial to sub-custodians. The value of such links was underlined during September and October, says Mr Brooks. Examples include being able to extend depository operating times because of transaction volumes, and working with regulators when Lehman went into liquidation.“We always talk about the value of local contacts [in the context of] bringing about change to markets, but last year we showed that you could also safeguard your client’s interests with those close contacts,” he says.Volatile conditions also create opportunities for sub-custodians to expand.Kevin Smith, head of global network management at BNY Mellon, says: “If a sub-custodian wants to expand quickly, they can fill the gaps that have been created by some institutions that are evaluating whether they want to stay in some markets, for example eastern Europe.”Ed Meulenbroek, head of financial institutions global banks and brokers at Kas Bank, agrees. He believes the crisis has made sub-custodians look at whether they are fully committed to a particular market.“We will see the lesser committed parties reconsider their strategy. Kas Bank is committed because we are a pure player, which also means we are never a competitor to our clients,” he says.Another firm to expand during the crisis is Citi Global Transaction Services. Satvinder Singh, head of direct custody and clearing, Emea, at the firm, says it has opened shop in five new countries in the past year, and may expand to further new markets this year.“We have seen a huge focus on using the crisis as an opportunity to get closer to our clients, win business, expand into new markets and expand product sets,” he says.“We are seeing smaller regional players scaling back. They are finding it difficult to compete with the global players.”Further opportunities to gain market share have arisen as global custodians look for alternative sub-custodians in a number of markets. This is in case something happens in that market and they need to move providers quickly.As a buyer of these services, Marshall Millsap, head of global market infrastructures, overseas network at JP Morgan Network Management, has been thinking about whether there is a need for alternative arrangements in certain situations.“We are having broader dialogue with some of our larger regional players about what else they may be able to do for us,” he says.Elizabeth Fortier, executive director at JP Morgan Network Management, adds: “The arrangements vary in the markets and banks we are working with, but ultimately the goal is to have a structure in place so we are prepared if a situation unfolds quickly.“We want to be positioned to get assets out of a bank into the back-up provider as quickly as possible, to preserve the liquidity of our client’s assets. This may not be practical in all cases, which is why we are reviewing our options on a market by market basis.”Pierre Jond, head of financial intermediary coverage at BNP Paribas Securities Services, says the firm has been organising these contingency networks or “plan B” structures for clients.“We have been engaging with a series of institutions to put arrangements in place for clients, which range from having preliminary conversations to having a major sub-custodian and a minor sub-custodian.“Clients are engaging with their providers to find out their capability to move and pull the plug on their sub-custodian,” says Mr Jond.However, the crisis has not only brought opportunities for sub-custodians; they too, like global custodians, are facing compressed fees. Assets, transactions and interest rates are all down, which means revenues for sub-custodians have also fallen.Sub-custodians say since the financial crisis began they have to spend more time with clients explaining processes and risks. Most argue that procedures have always been in place, they have just never been asked to demonstrate them.Kas Bank’s Mr Meulenbroek says his clients are much more focused on risk and ask questions on how those risks are being handled. He says: “This is a change of risk awareness in general. Before the crisis, the magic words were price and scalability.“Now the magic words are risk awareness, quality of services and pure play.”Citi’s Mr Singh believes since the Lehman crisis, there has been a better understanding of risk, including counterparty risk, documentation risk and market risk.“All of us have a better feel of the embedded risks, we have had frank and open discussions with clients to make sure we are all on the same page,” he says."
626;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-05T07:51:50Z;Evolving landscape sees complexity rise;;"What does the future hold for fund management? The question is important not just for fund managers but also for those whose business it is to provide support to them.“One assumes there will be fewer fund managers around, but the demand for funds will still be there,” says Paul North, head of product management for Europe, the Middle East and Asia at Bank of New York Mellon Securities Services. “It’s an ever-
evolving landscape.”This may sound as though life will be simpler for the custodians who safeguard the funds, but in fact complexity is likely to increase on the distribution end of the business, as open architecture and globalisation mean those fewer, larger fund manufacturers gain business from more distributors all across the world.These developments are only viable if every level of the fund value chain can be automated, a long-sought goal in the industry known as straight-through processing (STP). Trade orders and execution still frequently use fax or phone, expensive processes subject to human error at a number of points. Even where STP has been implemented, it uses one of a number of electronic messaging systems, none of which are interoperable.This can seem a daunting prospect for a fund manufacturer looking at green fields on the other side of the world.“You’re the manufacturer of a product – what do you want to do? You want to sell the product anywhere,” says Kevin Lee, chief executive of Calastone, a transaction crossing network that is attempting to make the STP gap easier to fill. “Fantastic, but if you implement that and the cost outweighs the benefit, you’re restricted from moving forward.“You need interoperability to bring the scale you need to make it efficient.”“It’s an ever-increasingly complex world, the distribution space,” says Mr North. “It’s becoming much more of a global space.” The globalisation of the industry is being driven partly by the search for business expansion by fund manufacturers but also by the near-universal popularity of the Ucits structure, the European fund structure that has also gained significant market share in Asia.“The Ucits product has been a fantastic platform for growth,” he says. “But there are still a lot of hurdles to get over in getting money into a Luxembourg fund.”For custodians being asked to provide custody services for example to funds manufactured in Europe and distributed in Asia, on a basic level, this means bridging language and time zone gaps. Then there are local reporting and regulatory issues. All this, plus global STP could seem daunting.The larger custodians such as BNP Paribas Securities Services and Bank of New York Mellon may already have the infrastructure in-house to manage whatever messaging system a distributor (or a manufacturer) is using, but nevertheless the development of Calastone is of interest to them as it provides opportunities for competition to come into the market from unexpected sources.“The sub-custodians perhaps could expand their market – would the custodian then retract?” suggests Mr Lee. “Then there is a question of the wrap platforms [which started as fund supermarkets for independent financial advisers]. Can a platform survive just providing domestic services?“Do the wrap platforms become custodians or do custodians become wrap platforms?” The question is not just whistling in the dark, as Calastone recently signed up Cofunds as a client. The UK-based Cofunds started as a platform offering IFAs access to a broad range of funds, but it now has an institutional offering that uses Calastone to provide the IT interface between itself and the investors.It is acting as an aggregator, a layer in fund distribution that is growing in significance, and therefore becoming a major consideration for the custodians.“More and more you have aggregation and the orders are bigger and bigger,” said Frédéric Perard, head of global fund services product at BNP Paribas Securities
Services.“The number of orders has strongly reduced, even if orders are coming in by fax.”Although fewer but larger orders may reduce the cost of processing funds, it increases the possible loss from input errors.“There is a strong movement to automate things,” says Mr Perard. “There is a strong incentive on the cost side, but also on the risk side.”Cofunds, says Mr Perard, has become a fully integrated fund distribution support service. “No one was really in that landscape before. There is a true convergence of business models.”Cofunds’ innovation has piqued the interest of the larger players whose sandpit it has entered. “We are looking at the same model,” says Mr Perard. “To make it work, you really have to look at the whole value chain.”The complexity in the value chain typically comes from the distributors, who “like to dream up all sorts of remuneration structures”, says Mr North. Since Cofunds is owned by asset managers, it could change the balance of power between distributors and manufacturers, with implications for the custodians who offer services to both sides."
627;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-05T07:46:02Z;Industry works hard to improve asset pricing;;The mispricing of assets is a problem that has not gone unnoticed.Last summer, on the same day the UK’s Financial Services Authority told investment companies to stop firing their valuation control staff and improve their pricing control checks, it also slapped Credit Suisse with a £5.6m (€6.1m, $8.1m) mispricing fine.Credit Suisse, the FSA found, had failed to “conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence”. The fine – one of the FSA’s largest-ever censures – came five months after Lehman Brothers had to suspend two of its equity traders for incorrectly valuing exotic equity derivatives. Negligence, as well as the ongoing financial crisis, has cast a shadow over the market’s ability to correctly price, not just illiquid, but liquid, assets – and the asset servicing industry is working hard to keep its clients happy.“It has changed the way we operate and has definitely put more pressure on us as a business,” says Kerry White, first vice president for global product management at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.“Clients want us to check, double check, and triple check our pricing. They want us to scrub, validate and find additional sources of price reference data – and that is what we are doing.”The head of the hedge and structured fund group at RBC Dexia Investor Services, Olivier Laurent, agrees: “Things are definitely now more difficult. Prior to the crash there was a move to more complex valuation models but that has stopped. The focus now is on simplicity: simpler models that people can understand and trust.”In spite of the warning from Hector Sants, the FSA’s chief executive, to investment companies to stop firing their valuation control staff, both BNY Mellon and RBC Dexia say they are adding to their pricing teams.“Firms’ valuation processes and controls have become increasingly stretched and in some cases have proven to be materially flawed or inadequate,” Mr Sants wrote in an open letter to chief executives. He recommended companies consider carefully any headcount reductions that will affect valuation control functions “at this sensitive time”.BNY Mellon and RBC Dexia are heeding that advice. “We have tripled the size of our OTC derivative team to manage the growth in demand for accurate pricing from our clients,” says Mr Laurent.“We are in an expanding business,” adds Ms White. “While we’re not hiring 20 new people into this area we are certainly redeploying staff from other areas of the business. We are changing the way we work.”That change means increasing pressure on the companies supplying price reference data to the asset servicing community.“Whilst we don’t create the prices – which we import from vendors – an enormous amount of time and energy goes into validating their quality,” says Ms White. “We are bringing serious pressure to bear to ensure that data is first class.“We have told our vendors to be on their game. It has been a painful exercise but has made them step up what they are doing – and they have done so because they know they can be replaced.”It is not just the quality of the data that has had to improve, however. The frequency with which it is provided has also changed.“Clients are certainly getting more data hungry,” says Mark Schoen, head of Emea product management, Northern Trust.“When you see household names like Lehman go out of business over a weekend you know you’re living in different times,” says Ms White. “As a result, clients want better information on a more regular basis.”On the OTC derivatives side, adds Mr Laurent, “clients only received weekly or bi-weekly valuations from the banks. The banks were very good at selling OTC products but the availability of regular pricing and liquidity was less satisfactory. That is now changing,” he says.Weaknesses identified by Mr Sants included inadequate checks on traders by senior front office staff, product control staff not challenging the trading floor and poor technology for verifying prices.The FSA says it will conduct checks in the first half of 2009 to make sure firms have improved their systems.The market believes it will like what it sees. “Opacity is a dirty word right now,” says Mr Schoen. “Improvements have and are being made.”
628;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-05T07:40:43Z;Cleaning up after the Madoff scandal;;"Billions of dollars have evaporated from European Ucits funds – reputed to provide the best protective legislation to investors – as a result of Bernard Madoff’s gigantic fraud.French or German, sophisticated and normal savers alike, hundreds have lost assets in the feeder funds – LuxAlpha, Thema, Herald – that nourished the US financier’s Ponzi scheme.It is no great surprise that regulators are taking the matter seriously. The European Commission has asked the Committee of European Securities Regulators (Cesr) to investigate how member states translated the Ucits textbook and how depositories interpreted these rules.Their conclusions are eagerly awaited by the industry; new regulation could be on the cards. “From that analysis, they [the Commission] have to take, after consulting the fund industry stakeholders, some decisions and probably some corrective actions. That is what the market is hoping,” says Paul Bodart, executive vice-president at BNY Mellon.On Cesr’s work list is whether the depository banks did their job properly. Could they have avoided the fiasco? The Luxembourg regulator, the CSSF, has been clear that, in its view, UBS, the depository bank behind the $1.4bn (£970m, €1bn) LuxAlpha fund, failed in its duties of due diligence as custodian of the assets.UBS gave sub-custody of the fund’s assets to the same entity that managed the fund. Madoff had become both manager and custodian, a situation Ucits rules have been drawn to avoid.There were also “red flags” that might have alerted observers that something was not quite right at Madoff Investment Services, such as the obscure auditor.“Depository banks, under their supervisory duties, have to make sure the professionals to which they give custody of assets are performing their duties,” Mr Bodart says.“So you have to go and visit the sub-custodian regularly and see if these guys are doing what they are supposed to do. That is where the difference is made.”Controls over Madoff’s quality as sub-custodian should have been particularly important because it was not its primary function, he adds.UBS does not accept it is guilty of anything and says it is “unfair” to blame it. It says marketing documentation addressed to the funds’ clients had stated it was delegating the safe-keeping of assets to a third-party.”The investors in LuxAlpha were sophisticated and explicitly agreed that the safekeeping of the securities was Madoff’s responsibility and not UBS’s,” it said.Cesr’s investigation could actually go much further than this case and could have far reaching implications for all depositories.The due diligence issues raised by LuxAlpha pose the question whether, under the Ucits regime, there is an obligation of means or an obligation of results when it comes to safe-keeping of assets.To answer that, Cesr is looking at how member states have implemented the Ucits directive in their own legislation. Most regulators say the text of the directive shows an “obligation of means”, where the depository must demonstrate it has performed its duties to the best of its abilities.In contrast, an “obligation of results” means only the outcome counts. In this case, the depository is responsible for assets under any kind of event, including bankruptcy and third-party fraud.France has repeatedly said the Madoff case was made possible because of differing interpretations of the directive, in spite of Luxembourg’s effort to say there were not any.The variety of opinions could at least lead Cesr to the conclusion that the text of the legislation left some place for interpretation in the past, experts believe.The European Commission has warned that in that case, it will tighten up the Ucits rules.Niall Bohan, head of the asset management unit at the European Commission, was asked at a recent Luxembourg conference: “Is the implementation of these [Ucits] principles in national law consistent with the expectations of investors, in particular, the interests of investors not to be prejudiced by the negligent performance of depositories, missions and responsibilities?He replied: “That is the test by which Ucits across Europe will be judged and I think we need to be very confident that the rules that we have in place as implemented in the member states deliver very clearly on that.”New rules for depositories could be bad news for the industry. If an “obligation of results” is imposed and banks are to bear more risks, such as a $50bn fraud, costs will undoubtedly rise.Mr Bodart says: “It is possible regulators could impose an obligation of results and quite honestly it would be frightening. If we are forced to have an obligation of results in the case of fraud or bankruptcy, we have to reconsider how we price the service we provide, given the exposure we are taking.”Regulators know, however, that when costs increase it is rarely the manufacturers that bear them. Investors, demanding the right to be protected from fraudsters, may have to pay the price of the Madoff scandal."
629;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-05T07:28:36Z;Providers in for rocky ride short term;;"The good news for at least some of the world’s securities services providers is that the medium- to long-term outlook is bright, despite the market dislocations experienced over the past 18 to 21 months or so.The not-so-good news is that the short-term outlook is distinctly cloudy, with many questions being raised about the likelihood of a new wave of consolidation that could change the face of the industry. The unease that lingers as a result of the storm that broke around the questionable reinvestment of cash collateral pledged by securities lending clients does not really help.“Over the next 12 to 18 months everyone in the industry has a lot of work to do,” says Conrad Kozak, chief executive of JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services. “The industry faces a hard slog.” He is not alone in expressing this view. Custodians and other providers of securities services are literally queuing up to tell a similar tale.“Some smaller niche players are getting hurt, and are taking a hit as clients worry about their underlying viability or their ability to continue to invest,” says Jay Hooley, president and chief operating officer at State Street.Andrew Gelb, head of Citi’s securities and fund services business in Europe, Middle East and Africa, says the capital market events of 2008 and the current economic climate mean financial services firms will naturally face a number of challenges, and securities services providers are no exception.It is something of a challenge in itself to decide where and how to begin painting the broad global picture of an industry that has already experienced one prolonged cycle of consolidation, which began in the mid-1990s and culminated in the merger that created the behemoth that is Bank of New York Mellon in July 2007. The question of whether or not any single individual institution will continue to offer securities services as a product line is arguably as good a place as any.If the flight to quality seen in recent months has only just begun, external pressure to capitulate and exit the business will add to the pressure being exerted by internal business reviews. “In these harsh economic times, everyone in financial services is taking a look at each business line they are in, and asking whether they can continue to make the necessary investment for future growth, or whether it is time to focus on a smaller number of more strategic businesses,” says Jim Palermo, co-chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.Giles Elliott, global head of product, Securities Services (Transaction Banking) at Standard Chartered Bank, believes the question of whether securities services is a core business will be a decisive factor for some institutions.He suggests that institutions for which it is a peripheral activity will question the logic of continuing to invest heavily in an information technology-hungry business and begin to formulate an exit strategy.But while the number of players in the industry will fall, competition will remain intense, he says. Consolidation will not be restricted to mergers and acquisitions, but will manifest itself in other ways too, as at least some clients consolidate down the number of relationships they have with custodians, moving greater volumes of assets to a smaller number of providers in search of greater efficiencies. Conversely, others will be taking the opposite approach, and spreading their eggs across a greater number of baskets. “Different clients have different needs, and some are more complex than others,” says Rajen Shah, head of global custody at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services.In an environment where the world has had the harshest of reminders that the collapse of a large financial institution is more than just a theoretical possibility, clients need to have a high degree of confidence that their service providers will remain in the business; a growing number are making contingency plans to protect themselves should their current provider(s) throw in the towel.The process that leads to the appointment of a custodian is an exhaustive one that takes place infrequently; no one undertakes it lightly, and those making the final decision need to be certain they are right. The financial strength of custodians has thus moved to the top of the desired requirements, knocking price off its pedestal. Price, though, remains important, even if it is only one component of the overall operating model.“Clients are concerned about value in relative terms, rather than price in absolute terms, and appreciate what is needed to deliver a high-touch, white-glove level of service,” says Rob Wright, global head product and client segments at RBC Dexia Investor Services.“If their provider is unable to continue to provide the necessary level of support, clients might be forced into changing provider at a time when they might not want to change,” says Mr Palermo.The extent of that support looks certain to grow, as the large falls in the value of many equities force an increasing number of clients to outsource functions. “Some of our clients have lost 50 per cent of their values, and I don’t imagine we will see markets rising by that much over the next two or three years,” says Mr Wright. “Many clients faced with re-examining their business model will concentrate their investment in the front office and sales, outsourcing more functions to external providers. It’s a tough climate, but we are feeling bullish about the opportunities, and are continuing to invest; business models are changing and we have to respond to that.”A number of the biggest custodians are reporting pipelines of potential new business that are looking unusually healthy, thanks to the much reported flight to quality. BNY Mellon Asset Servicing says it has been taking on a significant number of new relationships and mandates since last September, including responsibility for the administration of the US government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp). “This is clearly a validation of our strengths,” he says. “People have actually said: if it’s good enough for the US government, it’s good enough for us.”On a lesser scale, the change in mindset that has been forced upon hedge funds is having a beneficial effect for custodians. “Hedge funds are increasingly turning away from standalone prime brokers who have traditionally met all their needs,” says Jacques-Philippe Marson, chief executive officer of BNP Paribas Securities Services.Talk of change has spread well beyond the boundaries of the custodians. Gavin Gray, managing director of Dublin-based investment fund administrator Phoenix Fund Services, predicts hedge fund and private equity investors who have traditionally turned to custodians or prime brokers for off-the-shelf packages will turn to separate providers.“The one-stop-shop is no longer the preferred model for those looking to outsource,” says Mr Gray. “People liked it for the operational simplicity and the ease of risk analysis but investors are preferring to see a separation of roles.” A big welcome back please for unbundling, which was not dead after all, it seems, but only resting."
630;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US manufacturing data spur hope for economy;;The rapid contraction of US manufacturing activity ap­pears finally to be slowing, a survey showed on Wednesday, spurring tentative hopes that the country’s economy could be stabilising.Manufacturing output shrank again in March for the 14th consecutive month but the Institute for Supply Management index rose to 36.3 from 35.8 – slightly more than economists were ex­pecting. Any number of less than 50 shows a contraction.The sub-index for new factory orders rose to the highest level since August last year, giving stock markets a fillip on Wednesday.A scattering of better than expected data has emerged from the US economy in recent weeks, including rising mortgage applications and steadying retail sales. They have prompted cautious optimism among some US politicians, including Barack Obama, the president, who said last week there were “glimmers of stabilisation” in the economy.Wednesday’s data releases gave fodder to both optimists and pessimists. Private US companies cut 742,000 jobs in March, according to ADP’s closely watched monthly employment survey, as the recession continued to savage the labour market. Almost 100,000 more jobs were cut than economists were expecting.Revisions to February’s employment numbers showed 9,000 more jobs were lost than originally estimated, putting that month’s total job losses at 706,000.“It does suggest the labour market remains very fragile and that the outlook is dismal,” said Samarjit Shankar, director of global strategy at Bank of New York Mellon.The ADP numbers raised concerns that the US government’s monthly jobs data – seen as one of the most important indicators of the economy’s health – would also be dire when released on Friday.“It’s a terrible number. It is almost a loss of three-quarters of a million jobs, possibly the highest we have seen so far over the length of this crisis. Obviously [it is] foreboding ahead of [Friday’s] non-farm payrolls report,” said Matt Esteve, a foreign exchange trader at Tempus Consulting.A breakdown of the ADP data shows that the pain was spread throughout the economy, with large, mid-sized and small businesses all cutting a similar number of jobs. The goods-producing sector, including construction and manufacturing companies, cut 327,000 jobs, while service providers cut 415,000.ADP changed the methodology of its survey in December after it significantly undershot the US government’s labour report.●Sweden’s economy will contract by 4.2 per cent this year, pushing unemployment up to 11.7 per cent by 2011, writes Robert Anderson in Stockholm. The new government forecast represents a big revision from December’s prediction of a 0.8 per cent decline in gross domestic product and shows how the open economy is expected to suffer one of the worst recessions in western Europe. Industry has been severely hit by the collapse in global export orders and has reacted quickly by slashing production and jobs to maintain profitability.
631;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-04-01T21:16:04Z;Overview: Investors keep a nervous eye on G20 outcome;;"Fresh optimism about the US economy offered support to equity markets on Wednesday although the underlying mood remained cautious as investors awaited global and regional policy developments.“Real money investors remain wary ahead of the G20 meeting in London amid uncertainty about the policy direction thereafter,” said Samarjit Shankar at Bank of New York Mellon.Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, said G20 leaders must agree on a realistic redistribution of fiscal stimulus effort while avoiding a recurrence of imbalances. “If they fail to do so, market sentiment will be the first victim; the recent recovery in risk appetite will prove short-lived, and the current bear market rally could end quite quickly,” he warned.However, there was further evidence on Wednesday of the tentative rebound in the US economy that has helped to fuel the recent strong gains in equity indices.The Institute for Supply Management’s index of manufacturing activity edged up to 36.3 in March from 35.8, slightly above the consensus forecast but still the 14th successive reading below 50, which indicates contraction.“The continued improvement in the index, modest as it is, will fuel speculation that a recovery could, somewhat miraculously, already be under way,” said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics.He added that some of the other US data released on Wednesday also fell into the same “was catastrophic now just terrible” category.Pending home sales rose 2.1 per cent in February, while construction spending in the same month fell at slower than expected rate.The markets managed to shrug off grim figures on US private sector employment, even as analysts warned that they boded ill for Friday’s non-farm payroll report.There was also only a muted impact from a Bank of Japan Tankan survey of business sentiment that was as poor as most analysts had expected. The main index fell to a low, although analysts said the outlook was improving.The focus on Thursday will be on the European Central Bank as it announces its decision on interest rates. The consensus forecast is for the main refinancing rate to be lowered by 50 basis points – but according to Stephane Deo, economist at UBS, “a cut is not enough.“Since the Fed embarked on quantitative easing we have argued that the ECB will have to follow suit somehow and quickly,” Mr Deo said. “We think that some broader intervention in the money market will be announced very soon, probably tomorrow.”Equity markets across the board started the new quarter on a positive note. By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1.7 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1.6 per cent. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo rose 3 per cent.But the caution in the markets was reflected by wider corporate credit spreads, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of mostly junk-rated credits up 5.5 basis points at 178.5bp.Government bond traders focused on central bank operations as the Federal Reserve purchased $6bn of securities and the Bank of England bought and sold gilts in the market.There had been worries about the sale of 4.75 per cent 2015 gilts after last week’s failure of an auction of 40-year paper. But on Wednesday’s sale went reasonably well. A further test will come from Thursday’s auction of 2039 gilts.“Gilts are headed higher, but this is an increasingly false market, which should be a concern for everyone,” said Marc Ostwald at Monument Securities.The 10-year gilt yield fell 3bp to 3.31 per cent, while the yield on the 10-year Bund was 1bp lower at 2.99 per cent and the 10-year Treasury yield rose 1bp to 2.67 per cent.In the currency markets, the yen came under early pressure from the weak Tankan report while sterling gained against the dollar after data showed an improvement in the UK manufacturing sector.Commodities suffered a broad sell-off, with the US oil price below $49 a barrel after news of a rise in oil stockpiles and a drop in Japanese energy consumption. Base metals prices also fell as the Baltic Dry index dropped to an eight-week low."
632;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-30T20:14:29Z;Dollar and yen rally as stocks falter;;The dollar and the yen advanced on Monday as concerns over the US car sector helped stem the rally in risky assets.The Obama administration rejected restructuring plans for General Motors and Chrysler and news of more banking sector bail-outs in Spain and the UK undermined financial stocks.Analysts said investors were on the defensive ahead of the G20 meeting of world leaders, which is due to start in London on Thursday.Neil Mellor, at Bank of New York Mellon, said: “Although we remain of the view that forces are growing that will seriously undermine the dollar in the longer term, it is clear that the greenback has yet to fully relinquish its status as haven currency of choice.”Ulrich Leuchtmann, at Commerzbank, said the market was likely to pay special attention to possible G20 statements on the status of the dollar as the international reserve currency.He said every now and then there were suggestions of a basket to replace the dollar, but such a solution continued to look unlikely.“The market will decide which currency is the leading currency,” said Mr Leuchtmann.“Politicians, no matter how important they may be, cannot impose such a status.”By midday in New York, the dollar rose 0.5 per cent to $1.3153 against the euro, climbed 0.4 per cent to $1.4181 against the pound and gained 0.3 per cent to SFr1.1524 against the Swiss franc.The dollar fared even better against higher-yielding currencies, which have rallied strongly this month as equity markets have rebounded from their lows.The dollar rose 1.4 per cent to $0.6801 versus the Australian dollar, climbed 1.1 per cent to $0.5617 against the New Zealand dollar and was 3.6 per cent higher at Won1,391.90 against the South Korean won.Mitul Kotecha, at Calyon, said there were signs that the won, which has risen 18 per cent against the dollar this month, might struggle to make further gains.He said the main driver of the won’s strength had been its tight correlation with equity markets. “Given that we expect risk aversion to remain elevated it suggests that Asian equity markets could face renewed pressure, reversing some of the recent strength in Asian currencies as a result,” said Mr Kotecha.“The won was heavily oversold but has now moved back to a fair value level, suggesting little scope for further appreciation.”Only the yen outperformed the dollar, rising 1.1 per cent to Y96.90.The yen’s rise came in spite of figures that showed Japanese industrial production continued to tumble, dropping 9.4 per cent in February.Japanese car production was down 56.2 per cent in February from a year earlier.
633;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-22T22:56:39Z;More job losses at money managers;;US money managers are preparing another round of job losses, and are seeking to cut costs even further as investor redemptions show no signs of slowing.Capital Group, the parent of one of the largest managers, American Funds, has told employees in an internal memo that it will eliminate more jobs, its third round of cuts in the past six months. The latest move is part of a cost-cutting plan that includes a freeze on pay rises, Capital said. It has already cut close to 600 people, or 6 per cent of its staff. Prior to the current crisis, the group had only cut jobs once in its 78-year history.The memo said: “Given the continuing business decline, deeper cost-cutting measures will need to be pursued. Unfortunately, these will include the elimination of jobs across many groups.”Almost all fund companies have cut jobs in the past six months, and they are taking the unusual step of cutting fund managers as well as back office and support staff. Money managers have typically had a drop in assets under management of more than a third during the downturn, as a result of both heavy investor redemptions and performance losses.Fidelity late last year said it would cut 7 per cent of staff, or more than 3,000 people. Franklin Templeton, MFS, BlackRock, AllianceBernstein, State Street, Legg Mason, Janus and Putnam are among others that have reduced staff numbers.Even Pimco, one of few firms to have had an increase in assets under management, has cut jobs in London and Munich.The pressure on smaller companies is greater, as they lack the scale to absorb large cash outflows. Boston Company Asset Management lost 89 staff, almost a third of its employees, after its assets under management fell by half. The group, which manages the Dreyfus funds, is part of BNY Mellon.Pay freezes have become another common tactic to combat shrinking revenues. Of the 25 largest fund companies, only nine have attracted net new money to their stock and bond funds in the 12 months to February, Morningstar said.Hedge funds, which were a huge source of job growth in the financial sector during the past six years, have contracted sharply. Close to 1,500 hedge funds, a record 15 per cent of the total, closed last year, according to Hedge Fund Research, and liquidations have continued.
634;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-22T08:43:28Z;Currency volatility prompts radical rethink;;"Last year’s wild swings in the foreign exchange markets appear to be prompting a strategic rethink of the role of currency as an asset class.Although currency is now widely accepted as a legitimate asset class, it suffers from being a zero sum game, ie it has a market beta of zero, meaning there is no reason to believe investors as a whole should make money.Industry proponents get around this by arguing that the infamous carry trade – the practise of borrowing in low-yielding currencies and buying higher-yielding ones – benefits from a risk premium akin to that of equity markets, and therefore can deliver long-term positive returns.However, the carry trade, which proved highly lucrative between 2000 and 2007, reversed sharply last year, as it has a tendency to do at periodic intervals. “Funding” currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen rallied strongly against higher yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars and the British pound.A “naive” dummy carry trade portfolio constructed by Royal Bank of Scotland, and believed to be a fairly accurate representation of the real funds operating in this field, lost 32 per cent last year. And while this does not invalidate the concept of the carry trade as an investment strategy benefiting from a risk premium, it has led investors to reassess the manner in which they access the forex markets.In essence, some investors seem to be switching from single strategy funds to more wide-ranging vehicles that can switch between strategies at the drop of a hat.“There has been a big allocation away from carry, long-term trend following and short volatility. There has been a strong allocation primarily to fundamental discretionary, event driven and mean reversion,” says Mark Farrington, head of currency at Principal Global Investors, which manages $5.2bn (£3.6bn, €3.8bn) in forex.“You either need to have a discretionary fundamental manager or someone with a multi-strategy approach. Each style has periods of outperformance and under performance. The more profitable approach is to have a dynamic approach to styles.”James Binny, head of index research at RBS, adds: “I have heard that some mandates have switched to be more discretionary, just generally getting more balanced, and my hope is this is the way it will go.“People might be better off going for a hybrid manager that does a little bit of everything. They won’t be best of breed in every area but they would be good enough.”But as logical as this may sound, ditching the carry trade in favour of a more freewheeling approach reintroduces the problem of the underlying asset class containing no beta, so any gains by one participant must be balanced by losses for another.Forex cheerleaders argue it is possible for active traders as a whole to make money because so many participants, such as central banks, asset managers
passively hedging foreign exposure and the corporate sector, are non-profit maximisers.However, returns have fallen as more profit seekers have entered the sector, raising the possibility that excess returns are being arbitraged away.According to Deutsche Bank, a basket of forex strategies would have delivered annualised returns of 12 per cent between 1980 and 2005.However, an equally weighted basket of the four dummy portfolios operated by RBS (and previously ABN Amro) encompassing value, trend, and short volatility as well as carry, would have lost money for the fourth straight year in 2008, having never experienced more than one successive down year since the introduction of floating exchange rates in 1971.Real returns also appear to be mixed. According to BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, currency overlay managers have produced negative excess returns (ie over cash) over one year, three years and five years, although they are positive over longer periods.Mercer, the consultancy, found the median active manager generated excess returns of 1.4 per cent last year, but zero over three years. And these returns are before fees.Deutsche’s FX Select database, perhaps the most comprehensive guide to the performance of unconstrained currency managers, found funds have delivered total accumulated excess returns of around 5 per cent since 2004. Further, total returns last year, at 5.3 per cent, were the highest since the days of double-digit returns in 2003.Mr Binny believes that, despite the sharp reverse, the carry trade is still a genuine source of “alternative beta”, with the drawdown since June 2007 “not inconsistent” with previous losses (see table above).“It’s not unprecedented. If you consider it a form of alternative beta, it’s really the same or slightly better than equity beta,” he says. “What worries me from the current industry perspective was that the end investor was probably overweight in the carry trade. Carry was a bubble that grew with all the other bubbles.”Whatever the truth of this argument, interest in investing in forex has been piqued by the woes of other asset classes.“It was the only major asset class that was up last year. People are increasing their exposure to currencies, although that is probably more to do with liquidity than anything else,” says Bilal Hafeez, global head of forex strategy at Deutsche Bank, of the $3,200bn-a-day market.“We have non-FX clients who want to trade currencies now because their own markets are closed and the fact that currency did reasonably well,” says Mr Hafeez, who cites credit and long/short equity funds as among those that are turning to forex to avoid severe illiquidity and political restrictions on their
activities.“Governments are not focusing on this. No one is complaining about selling currencies short. The only risk would be if governments introduced capital controls and that would be a very big change in the financial architecture,” he adds.Diane Miller, principal at Mercer, reports increased interest as returns from currency, although “not stunning”, have outstripped most other assets of late.Mr Farrington says existing clients have increased their allocations, although potential new clients appear to be deferring the issuance of new mandates in any asset class."
635;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-18T18:31:31Z;Norway’s krone: the new safe haven currency?;;The Swiss National Bank’s decision to intervene to weaken the franc has left currency investors with one less haven from the financial crisis.Its move comes at a time when there are also questions surrounding the future haven status of two other leading currencies: the dollar and the yen.While the dollar has enjoyed a liquidity premium amid the current financial turmoil, many investors expect it to lose its allure as the full impact of large-scale US fiscal and monetary loosening filters through.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon says: “The dollar has clearly been supported by haven flows during the current crisis.“But, in the longer-term, the sheer scale of US fiscal spending and the lack of international capital available to support it represents a direct threat to the dollar’s strength.”The other main beneficiaries during the current crisis, the Swiss franc and the yen, have both lost their haven status in recent weeks.The Swiss franc has been driven lower by the SNB, which last week intervened to sell the currency, saying its recent appreciation represented an unwelcome tightening in monetary conditions.Meanwhile, the yen has been undermined by a series of data showing a steep downturn in Japan’s export-driven economy.This has helped stoke expectations that the Bank of Japan will follow the SNB and intervene to weaken its currency.So where do currency investors turn now? One answer could be Norway.David Bloom at HSBC says “The ultimate haven currency in our view is the Norwegian krone. “It’s probably the best currency in the world.”This might seem surprising. Only last December the krone dropped to a record low against the euro, as falling oil prices took their toll on the currency. But, as crude prices have stabilised, the oil producer’s currency has fought back strongly.Indeed, the krone is one of the few currencies that has outperformed the dollar so far this year, rising more than 3 per cent to NKr6.694. It has soared 11 per cent to NKr10.925 against the euro.Mr Bloom says: “The Norwegian krone is our preferred major currency and we expect a sustained appreciation over the next 18 months.”Analysts say on a number of measures, the krone is near or at the top of the league among the world’s 10 most traded currencies.Norway’s economy grew 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year and is not forecast to experience as big a downturn as most other leading economies this year.Monetary policy is also supportive of the krone, with the Norges Bank, Norway’s central bank, like those in other commodity-producing countries such as Australia and New Zealand, not expected to resort to quantitative monetary easing to boost inflation expectations. The country also has a large current account surplus.The cost of insuring against sovereign default in Norway through credit default swaps is the lowest among the countries with the ten most traded currencies.Mr Bloom says that if the stock of assets Norway has salted away from its oil revenues in the Government Pension Fund of Norway is added to the mix, the bullish story for the krone is complete.But some analysts are less glowing about the krone’s prospects.Gavin Friend at NAB Capital agrees the krone appears one of the best of a bad lot, with a healthy current account balance and interest rates likely to lend it support.But he says: “You are trying to win the least ugly currency contest at the moment. I can’t disagree that it might move higher, but I can’t get too enthusiastic.”His main concerns are the lack of liquidity in the market and the krone‘s long-held correlation with oil prices.“I struggle to see how the Norwegian krone can outperform for a sustained period if oil prices remain low,” he says.Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets says the fact that the krone fell against both the dollar and the euro during the turbulence following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September means it cannot really be called a haven currency.But he believes that the krone, along with the Australian dollar, is ideally positioned for prolonged gains as risk appetite improves.He says the Australian dollar represents an economy with a superior growth outlook. The country’s budget surplus is expected to hover at 1 per cent of gross domestic product – which compares with the deepening deficits of the US, Europe and Japan.He says: “The krone has the upper hand as its structural situation is boosted by a hefty current account surplus standing at 5 per cent of GDP – the biggest in the industrialised world”.The other investment instrument that tends to have strong haven properties is gold – even though gold has weakened somewhat from its recent peak above $1,000 an ounce.Gold’s appeal has been highlighted this week by Paulson & Co, the hedge fund. It took a $1.28bn stake in gold miner AngloGold Ashanti on Tuesday as part of a bet that gold would benefit as paper currencies were debased by global central banks turning on the printing presses to tackle the financial crisis.Indeed, with quantitative easing and the possibility of printing money being expanded across the world, gold’s defensive properties are set to become more desirable, analysts say.“In a world where central banks are expected to increasingly turn to quantitative easing, there are less and less havens in currency terms. Gold should look increasingly attractive,” says Mr Derrick.www.ft.com/gold
636;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-13T18:44:53Z;HSBC and BNY Mellon sued over ‘minibonds’;;A group of investors has sued HSBC and Bank of New York Mellon, alleging that the banks failed to protect Hong Kong buyers that bought into complex derivative instruments known as “minibonds” linked to the now defunct Lehman Brothers.The class-action lawsuit filed in New York calls for $1.6bn of collateral held by HSBC and BNY Mellon to be released to investors. Minibonds have lost most of their value since the collapse of Lehman.According to the complaint, HSBC is the issuer, trustee and custodian of the minibonds, while BNY Mellon is custodian of some assets held by the products.The complaint named Lehman as one of the defendants. The class action was filed by the US law firm Coughlin Stoia, which also represented a group of Enron investors.“The trustee failed to protect the collateral backing the minibonds. The issuer failed to execute the terms of the deal so that the promised high-quality collateral would be purchased and safeguarded, and also failed to give notice of negative information about the derivatives underlying the minibonds,” according to the complaint.HSBC said it was the trustee of the minibonds, but not the issuer. The bank said it did not know whether it was a custodian.“Any suggestion that we were involved with the design or selling of the minibonds is wrong. We were the trustee and we provided services on that basis,” HSBC said.BNY Mellon declined to comment.About 34,000 investors in Hong Kong bought HK$13.9bn (US$1.79bn) worth of the Lehman minibonds from 23 local banks and brokers.The products were sold for at least five years before the US bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year.The minibonds were also sold in Singapore, although this class action focuses on Hong Kong.Controversy surrounding the minibonds has sparked an outcry in Hong Kong, as angry investors, mostly retirees and pensioners, alleged that they had been misled to believe the minibonds were as safe as bonds.“Although these minibonds were marketed as low-risk, safe and secure, in reality they were backed by numerous credit default swaps and synthetic collateralised debt obligations – the kinds of toxic financial instruments that are at the heart of the current financial crisis,” the complaint said.Peter Chan, chairman of the Allied Victims of Lehman Products in Hong Kong, said the lawsuit was a “milestone”, adding: “We have suffered a lot in the last few months. I hope this would bring us closer to an end.”Some minibond holders in Hong Kong have filed court cases against individual banks in the territory, which does not have a class action suit system.Hong Kong’s legislative council has formed a special committee to investigate the issue and any mis-selling, while the Securities and Futures Commission, the market regulator, is also looking into it.In January, Sun Hung Kai Investment Services, a local broker, agreed to refund HK$85m to more than 300 buyers in full for their losses on the minibonds.
637;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-12T20:14:57Z;Swiss action sparks talk of ‘currency war’;;The Swiss National Bank moved to weaken the Swiss franc on Thursday, the first time a big central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange markets since Japan sought to weaken the yen in 2004.The bank’s move, which sparked fears that other countries could follow suit, comes as the value of the Swiss franc has soared as investors seek a haven from the recent market turmoil. In October, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it rose to a record high of about SFr1.43 against the euro, a level it has come close to again in recent weeks.But it fell to its lowest level this year on Thursday after the SNB said the currency’s strength represented an “inappropriate tightening of monetary conditions” as it battled against a slowdown in the Swiss economy.“In view of this development, the SNB has decided to purchase foreign currency on the foreign exchange market to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro,” the central bank said.The Swiss franc dropped 2.6 per cent to SFr1.5192 against the euro and dropped 3.2 per cent to $1.1894 against the dollar.Analysts said the move was likely to increase talk that countries were set to engage in a bout of competitive devaluation.“Let the currency wars begin,” said Chris Turner at ING Financial Markets.Countries around the world faced with the constraint of zero interest rate levels might feel it was acceptable to intervene to weaken their currencies in order to ease monetary conditions, he said, adding that other export-dependent economies such as Japan would “probably be at the head of the queue”.Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon agreed.“Market intervention by a major central bank such as the SNB opens up the door for other central banks, namely the Bank of Japan, to follow suit,” he said. “The yen is widely perceived in Japan to be overvalued.”The SNB also cut its interest rates by 25 basis points, taking its three-month Libor target range down to zero to 0.75 per cent, and announced plans to adopt a quantitative easing approach to monetary policy.Analysts said the move towards quantitative easing was sparked by a drastic revision to the central bank’s forecast for growth, which is now expected to fall between 2.5 and 3 per cent in 2009, much worse than its previous forecast of a drop of between 0.5 and 1 per cent.The SNB said economic conditions had deteriorated sharply since its last policy meeting in December and that there was a risk of deflation over the next three years.“Decisive action is thus called for, to forcefully relax monetary conditions,” the central bank said.Additional reporting by Haig Simonian in Zurich
638;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-05T17:48:03Z;Inflation warning hurts Swedish krona;;The Swedish krona tumbled close to a record low against the euro Thursday after an official warned of the inflationary impact of the currency’s recent fall.The krona, which this week hit a record low of SKr11.6596 against the euro, has dropped more than 6 per cent against the single currency this year.The fall has been fuelled by a sharp deterioration in Sweden’s export-driven economy and concerns over the exposure of the country’s banks to a slump in the Baltic states.Svante Öberg, first deputy governor of the Swedish central bank, said Thursday he expected the krona to strengthen as the current financial crisis waned.But the krona fell as he warned that there was a risk the currency’s weakness would be more prolonged and lead to an “inflationary impulse” in the Swedish economy.By midday in New York, the krona had fallen 2 per cent to SKr11.6240 against the euro and lost 2.7 per cent to SKr9.2575 against the dollar.The pound fell after the Bank of England outlined plans to stimulate the UK economy by using quantitative easing.The Bank’s monetary policy committee, as expected, cut UK interest rates by 50 basis points to a record low of 0.5 per cent. Sterling lost ground as the Bank announced plans to undertake a programme of asset purchases of £75bn financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.Neil Mellor, at Bank of New York Mellon, said the decision offered little upside for the pound due to growing concerns over long-term inflation.“As such, in conjunction with ongoing frailty in the UK banking sector and an ongoing economic downturn of unknown proportions, an era of quantitative easing is one more thing for investors to worry about,” said Mr Mellor. “Sterling is likely to suffer accordingly.”The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.4122 against the dollar and dropped 1.2 per cent to Y138.85 against the yen.Sterling rose 0.3 per cent to £0.8890 against the euro as the European Central Bank cut eurozone interest rates by 50bp to 1.5 per cent. The euro fell after Jean Claude Trichet, ECB president, struck a more dovish tone than expected, saying 1.5 per cent was not necessarily the lowest rates could go and revised growth forecasts sharply lower.The euro fell 0.8 per cent to $1.2558 against the dollar and dropped 1.4 per cent to Y123.44 against the yen.While the yen rose 0.7 per cent to Y98.28 against the dollar, the US currency advanced elsewhere, as a renewed sell-off in equities boosted haven demand.The dollar gained 0.5 per cent to SFr1.1744 against the Swiss franc climbed 0.4 per cent to C$1.2800 against the Canadian dollar and rose 1 per cent to $0.6427 against the Australian dollar.
639;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-03T22:59:36Z;US bank set to acquire Gleacher Partners;;Broadpoint Securities, a US investment bank, on Tuesday said it would acquire merger advisory firm Gleacher Partners, which was founded by Eric Gleacher, a former head of mergers and acquisitions for Morgan Stanley.Broadpoint will pay $20m and issue 23m shares of common stock to Gleacher’s selling shareholders, who include Mr Gleacher, its chairman. MatlinPatterson, a private equity firm that is Broadpoint’s controlling shareholder, has agreed to the structure of the deal.The combined firm will have 285 employees across its investment banking, capital markets and other divisions and will be called Broadpoint Gleacher.Gleacher was formed in 1990 by Mr Gleacher, who had been global M&A head for Morgan Stanley and, prior to that, helped found Lehman Brothers’ M&A banking practice in the late 1970s. Clients of the firm, which also does restructuring work, have included ConAgra, the agricultural company, and MFS Communications.“The opportunity here is to create a full-fledged investment bank to fill the void that has been created by the demise of the competition,” Mr Gleacher said in an interview. “We don’t see this as selling out at all. I personally took all equity on this deal.”Broadpoint has been working to expand rapidly over the past 18 months, both by hiring to expand various units and by making acquisitions. It bought American Technology Research, an equity research firm, last year, as well as an institutional fixed income division of Bank of New York Mellon.MatlinPatterson invested $50m in equity in Broadpoint in September 2007 when the bank, which had earlier been called First Albany, was launched. The investment gave MatlinPatterson a 61 per cent stake in the company at that time and handed its employees a 19 per cent interest.Broadpoint, which is run by chief Lee Fensterstock and publicly traded on Nasdaq, raised another wave of capital from employees and new investors last year including $25m from MAST Capital, which received warrants to own up to 10 per cent of the company’s stock.Mr Fensterstock will be Broadpoint Gleacher’s chief executive. Mr Gleacher, who helped Mr Fensterstock in the acquisition of Broadpoint’s fixed income unit last year, will become its chairman.Shares of Broadpoint, which has a market capitalisation of about $190m, rallied 12.3 per cent to $2.35 a share by midday on Tuesday. In spite of the struggling credit and equity markets, Broadpoint’s shares have risen more than 50 per cent in the past year.Broadpoint Securities and Broadpoint Capital, the firm’s broker-dealer subsidiary, have hired a range of people over the past year.The bank says its annualised revenues rose to $202m in the fourth quarter of last year as compared with $35m a year earlier.Gleacher has a sister company in London called Gleacher Shacklock, headed by Tim Shacklock, former deputy chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.

641;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-03-01T10:09:11Z;Optimist sees gains to be made in the long run;;"As a keen jogger and part-owner of the publishing company behind Running Free magazine, it is perhaps no surprise that Jon Little has taken the ghastly events of the past 18 months in his stride.The vice-chairman of Bank of New York Mellon Asset Management, Mr Little saw assets under management slide 17 per cent to $928bn (£643bn, €728bn) in 2008, while fee income fell 26 per cent to $657m.But, backed by the world’s largest custodian and trust bank, and with net inflows into its asset management arm last year, BNY Mellon has steered a relatively untroubled course; its shares are only down 50 per cent in the past 12 months, better than most in the financial firmament.Such is Mr Little’s confidence, not only that BNY Mellon remains on track but that markets will come good in the long run, he is now contemplating adding to the bank’s roster of 17 boutique asset management houses.“By any standards we have had a good war, we’ve got a good balance sheet and our credit rating was maintained, and in one case raised, last year. There are probably no other large cap US financials that can say that,” says Mr Little.“There are people who are going to say ‘we want to be part of a big organisation’ that would not have said that before. We have had approaches, discussions, investment banks flying kites and there are businesses out there we think are for sale.”However, Mr Little believes fair value for asset managers is now around six to eight times earnings, rather than the 12-14 times prevalent during the boom years, and many vendors have not fully adjusted to the new reality.“There is still a degree of a lack of reality. People are still thinking in terms of double-digit multiples. An air of realism will creep in when people say ‘we need to shore up our balance sheet, what can we sell?’ If you are a bank or an insurance company on a p/e multiple of four, even in this market you can sell for more than four. It is earnings enhancing.“We don’t feel like we have to add, but there are always things that would fill a geographical gap or an asset class, or something that becomes available that looks very compelling,” says Mr Little, who cites the lack of an Indian fund management business as one such gap.In particular, Mr Little believes banks in countries such as Italy and Spain, where some participants “badly damaged” their asset management arms in the past year by encouraging customers to switch into deposit accounts, will decide they are no longer core.“They have pinned a notice on [asset managers’] foreheads telling them where they stand in the bank, ie in last place. The domestic fund market in Italy has been almost bombed out of existence. I think it’s going to be quite tough for some to rebuild.“A big wave of deals is coming, but we are not quite there yet. If the dam bursts and there is consolidation, we will probably be an active player in that,” adds Mr Little, who says BNY Mellon has achieved “near 100 per cent” retention of assets and staff in recent acquisitions, rebutting the conventional argument against an M&A-led approach to the industry.Mr Little also detects a “flight to quality” among investors, with bigger houses more in demand. This is particularly so for money market funds, where investors are exhibiting a strong preference for players with deep enough pockets to bail out funds that lose value, or break the buck.BNY Mellon rescued four of its funds in this manner last year, as well as putting in place a cash support agreement, effectively an overdraft to cover spikes in redemptions. Dreyfus, its money market boutique, accounted for $321bn of the group’s assets at the end of 2008.Stripping out money market funds, BNY Mellon suffered net outflows last year, with its fund of hedge fund offerings seeing redemptions off the back of weak industry-wide performance.Mr Little believes the fund of fund sector will survive, but in a slimmer form and with lower fees. “There is going to be a lot of attrition, a lot of managers are going to go out of business or be taken over.”But with a smorgasbord of boutiques specialising in everything from Brazilian equities and sub-investment grade debt to mezzanine finance and foreign exchange, some niches are always likely to be in demand.Perhaps surprisingly, emerging market local currency debt was one such niche last year, attracting a net $500m despite the travails of many emerging market currencies.“Clients have become more sophisticated. Currencies eventually get back to fair value” says Mr Little. With many Asian nations in particular still having a cushion of solid reserves and current account surpluses, he adds: “I think it’s hard to argue with the medium-term argument” in favour of emerging market currencies.Newton, BNY Mellon’s $50bn London-based equity and bond house, has done better still, attracting new inflows of more than $1bn last year, with its income funds a beneficiary of tumbling bank deposit rates.Despite this, Mr Little is frustrated at the lack of interest in Newton’s range of balanced funds. Its Exempt and Global Balanced funds held the top two spots in the latest CAPS survey of balanced funds for their performance over one, three and five years and limited losses last year to 3 per cent, against almost 20 per cent for the balanced sector at large.“It does annoy us. We have a fund that has attracted very little money despite top decile performance over almost every discrete time period. It has done brilliantly yet we cannot attract money to it because everyone is bound up with having a US, a UK, a small cap, a large cap manager. People don’t seem willing to let a fund manager decide the asset allocation.”“We do scratch our heads a bit. It has done too well for too long over all market conditions to be a fluke.”"
642;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-02-13T19:56:31Z;Money printing fears hit pound;;The pound lost ground this week as the Bank of England delivered a gloomy assessment of the UK economy and indicated it was prepared to consider unconventional monetary policy measures as it grappled with the current slowdown.In its quarterly inflation report on Wednesday, the Bank cut its growth estimates sharply and forecast that UK inflation would fall well below its 2 per cent target if interest rates remained at their current level.This lifted expectations that the Bank would deliver a further cut in interest rates after lowering them by 50 basis points to 1 per cent last week.But it was the statement that the Bank would embark on a policy of quantitative monetary easing once interest rates fell to zero that undermined sterling.Mervyn King, Bank governor, said the central bank would “certainly” be buying gilts and the money supply needed to be increased.Neil Mellor, at Bank of New York Mellon, said the announcement that the Bank might turn to the printing press had hit sentiment towards the pound.“Sterling is certainly going to struggle in this environment,” he said.The news helped stem a rally in sterling when it rose as high as $1.4984 against the dollar on Monday as UK financial stocks recovered from their recent lows. Sterling’s fortunes have remained closely tied to movements in financial stocks, given the UK economy’s high exposure to the sector.The pound sold off as equities fell on disappointment over US bank rescue plans revealed by Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, on Tuesday.Reports that the US was set to announce plans to subsidise mortgages boosted equities and lifted the pound Friday.Analysts said the pound also received support on fears that the communiqué after this weekend’s G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers could make a specific reference to concerns over sterling’s weakness.Over the week, the pound fell 2.6 per cent to $1.4388 against the dollar, lost 1.9 per cent to £0.8937 against the euro and dropped 2.6 per cent to Y132 against the yen.The ebb and flow of investor risk appetite continued to dominate currency trading. Investors focused on the gyrations of global stock markets with economic data releases having little effect on sentiment. The dollar advanced as rising risk aversion boosted haven demand for the currency.Over the week, the dollar climbed 0.8 per cent to $1.2862 against the euro, rose 0.2 per cent to SFr1.1614 against the Swiss franc and gained 2.2 per cent to $0.6582 against the Australian dollar.The dollar was little changed at Y91.77 against the yen on the week as the Japanese currency also benefited from haven flows.The yen rose 0.8 per cent to Y118.05 against the euro over the week, added 2.1 per cent to Y60.52 against the Australian dollar and rose 1.1 per cent to Y48.12 against the New Zealand dollar.The Swedish krona fell sharply after the country’s central bank cut interest rates by more than expected after its policy meeting.The bank slashed rates by 100bp to a record low of 1 per cent and said it might have to cut rates further. The Swedish krona fell 3.8 per cent to SKr8.3873 against the dollar over the week and lost 3 per cent to SKr10.7840 against the euro.
643;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-02-12T15:27:01Z;View of the Day: Why the rouble still looks risky;;"The recent appreciation of the rouble by no means indicates that Russia has yet secured stability for the currency - particularly if oil prices continue to suffer from declining optimism about the global economy, says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He notes that the rouble’s jump on Wednesday was the biggest since the current composition of its euro/dollar trading basket was established two years ago. “On the face of it, the central bank’s efforts to steer the rouble away from the lower boundary of its trading band appear to be working,” he says.“But in doing so, the Bank has been obliged to draw upon its full arsenal; it has hiked interest rates, limited the money on offer at its liquidity operations, cautioned investors against depreciation bets and put its money where its mouth is by using up around one third of its reserves to defend the currency. Yet it remains to be seen whether this will be enough.”Mr Mellor says that for the week to February 6, the central bank spent a further $4.6bn defending the rouble; and that if weakening optimism indeed bodes ill for the oil price, this might be at the lower end of the expenditure scale.“The rouble might have enjoyed a degree of respite, but, at the very least until the price of oil shows greater signs of life, pressure on the currency is unlikely to desist - resulting in central bank intervention that can only further under- mine confidence in Russia’s current credit ratings.”"

645;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-01-28T22:28:20Z;Overview: Financials lifted as toxic-asset plans gather pace;;Financial stocks across the globe powered ahead on Wednesday as investors focused on US efforts to stabilise the banking system and absorbed comments from the Federal Reserve after a two-day policy meeting.Long-term Treasury yields rose sharply and the dollar rallied after the US central bank signalled it was prepared to buy long-term government debt if it would help improve conditions in financial markets. The Fed as expected left its key interest rate unchanged at between zero and 0.25 per cent and said borrowing costs would stay low for some time.Wall Street set a new high for the day after the Fed meeting finished and maintained its firm tone as hopes gathered pace that the new US administration was close to establishing a “bad bank” to ring-fence toxic assets.Steve Barrow, strategist at Standard Bank, noted that such a move had been talked about for some time.“Nonetheless, with the $825bn stimulus plan already wending its way through Congress there could clearly be some hope that the Obama administration has hit the ground running – which could prove positive for stock market sentiment, positive for risk-taking and, ironically, negative for the dollar if risk-taking improves,” he said.But Neil Mellor, at Bank of New York Mellon, warned that the current market environment was barely conducive to a sustained rise in risk tolerance. “Uneven performances and week-to-week gyrations in sentiment have become the norm since the eye of the credit storm blew over markets last autumn,” he cautioned.“Volatility is an inevitable by-product of attempts to discount the bottom of the economic cycle, but then this is being exacerbated by the extraordinary nature and dimensions of the current downturn.”On the currency markets, the yen came under pressure as safe-haven demand waned amid a powerful showing by global equity markets. Early losses for the dollar were trimmed after the Fed meeting concluded, with the dollar index entering positive territory.Sterling extended its recent gains, helped by a particularly strong performance from UK banking stocks.Financials enjoyed strong gains virtually across the board and provided the main impetus for equity markets .The pan-European banking sector climbed more than 11 per cent as the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 3.2 per cent – its best one-day advance so far this year. The FTSE 100 in London added 2.4 per cent.Wall Street also recorded big gains for financials and the S&P 500 closed up 3.4 per cent, its first four-day rally since late November.Seoul led Asian stock markets higher as the benchmark Kospi index jumped 5.9 per cent. Australian shares climbed 1.5 per cent while in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average edged up 0.6 per cent.The better tone to equities was reflected in a narrowing of credit spreads. The investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index fell 4 basis points to 152bp, while the Market CDX North America touched an 11-week low of 190.5bp, down 8.5bp from Tuesday’s close.US government bonds went into reverse as the market absorbed the Fed’s latest remarks.Traders were disappointed that the Fed did not make an explicit commitment to buy Treasuries.James Knightley, at ING, noted that the Fed had warned of significant downside risks to growth. “Therefore, we believe the bond market can rally anew.”The yield on the 10-year note rose 14 basis points to 2.66 per cent, while the 30-year yield jumped 18 to 3.42 per cent, near levels last seen in December.Eurozone bonds also slipped, with the 10-year Bund yield up 1bp at 3.25 per cent.But the shorter end of the eurozone curve was supported by preliminary data showing that German inflation had fallen to its lowest annual rate for five years – which analysts said was likely to ease the way for further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank.In commodities, oil saw choppy trading after US inventories data showed a big rise in crude stocks last week. ICE March Brent rose $1.17 to $44.90 a barrel.Gold eased back below $900 an ounce as recent safe-haven buying dried up.The Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of bulk commodity shipping costs, rose for a seventh successive session.

That provided the biggest drag on the Hang Seng, which closed 2.9 per cent lower at 12,583.63, an eight-week low, while the sub index of mainland Chinese shares traded in the territory fell 3.9 per cent to 6,730.82.China Life was in focus after announcing that its net profit last year was probably 50 per cent lower than 2007. Shares in the company lost 7.5 per cent to HK$20.30, the second-biggest drag on the Hang Seng. Angang Steel lost 12.9 per cent to HK$6.90 after disappointing earnings.The Nikkei 225 dropped to a seven-week low, losing 2 per cent to 7,901.64. The market has lost 10.8 per cent so far this year. The broader Topix fell 2.2 per cent to 787.15.The yen strengthened overnight against the dollar, once more weighing on exporter stocks. Canon lost 2.2 per cent to Y2,725 and Sony fell 1.8 per cent to Y1,989. The electronics company is likely to announce details of its restructuring plan on Thursday.Nissan fell 5.5 per cent to Y309 and Mazda dropped 5 per cent to Y152. A local report said the automaker was planning on asking for government help to pay about 10,000 employees’ wages at a couple of its plants in Japan.Sumitomo Mitsui Financial fell 5.4 per cent to Y3,340, while Mizuho Financial dropped 4.8 per cent to Y217 and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial dropped 3.8 per cent to Y483.Dowa Holdings shares dropped 9.8 per cent to Y276 after the zinc and copper smelter revised its earnings forecast to an Y18bn loss and halved its dividend forecast.Nippon Steel dropped 2.1 per cent to Y278 following data showing that steel production declined 28 per cent in December from a year earlier.In one bright spot for the markets, D-Ram makers in Taiwan and Japan’s Elpida gained following reports that consolidation talks were ongoing. Elpida gained 2.3 per cent to Y545, while Taiwan’s Promos gained 6.3 per cent to T$1.51, and Powerchip rose 7 per cent to T$3.07.In Korea, the Kospi dropped 2.1 per cent to 1,103.61. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering ended the day down 0.7 per cent at Won20,250. Local reports said that Korea Development Bank and Hanwa Group hadn’t been able to agree on financial terms for the sale of the former’s majority stake in the company.In Australia, shares lost 1 per cent to 3,442.8. BHP Billiton shares dropped 1 per cent to A$28.66, in line with the broader market after it said it would axe 6,000 jobs and cut production at its Australian nickel mines.Rio Tinto shares shed 2 per cent to A$37.25 after it announced job cuts and plans to reduce aluminium output.The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 1,985.016, while in Mumbai, the Sensex was down 2.4 per cent at 8,880.83.
647;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-01-20T21:45:49Z;US banks push financials to 14-year low;;More spectacular declines in US bank shares pushed the financial sector to its lowest level since 1995 during what was easily Wall Street’s worst ever inauguration day sell-off.The benchmark S&P 500 index dived beneath a nadir reached last month, a key support level, leaving it only 7 per cent away from an 11-year low hit in November.“The feeling is, ‘When’s it going to stop?’” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global, who said much of the selling was being driven by continued fears of outright nationalisation of key financial institutions.A slew of further analyst warnings of widening losses from bad loans, higher writedowns and dividend cuts sent the S&P 500 financials index down 16.7 per cent.Citigroup, down more than 40 per cent last week when the group disclosed a break-up plan, tumbled a further 20 per cent to $2.80 as several analysts widened their loss forecasts.Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer said the group’s “core problem is that it simply doesn’t make money in any of its businesses except Smith Barney, which it is in the process of selling.”Jason Goldberg, analyst at Barclays, warned: “While its split into separate entities should help cosmetics, it doesn’t alter its risk profile.”Wells Fargo, which has yet to disclose fourth-quarter earnings, lost 23.8 per cent to $14.23 after FBR analysts became the latest to warn of higher credit losses and the threat of a dividend cut.“We would continue to avoid the shares until its balance sheet is better capitalised,” said the analysts, who noted Wells Fargo was the only one of the largest four banking stocks to trade above tangible book value.Bank of America, which also dropped by more than 40 per cent last week, shed a further 29 per cent to $5.10, while JPMorganChase lost 20.7 per cent to $18.09.A 71 per cent drop in fourth quarter profit and the scale of unrealised losses on investments at State Street, down 59 per cent to $14.89, spurred a sell-off in the custodian bank sector. Bank of New York Mellon sank 17.3 per cent to $19.Regional banks, too, did badly in the wake of results from Regions Financial, whose shares were pushed 24.2 per cent lower to $4.60 by a worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss. PNC Financial Services was among the heaviest hit, down 41.4 per cent to $22.The S&P opened lower and sold off sharply throughout the session to close 5.3 per cent down at 805.22. The benchmark index lost 2.7 per cent after President Obama was sworn in at midday.The heaviest previous inauguration day sell-off was that of Lyndon B Johnson in 1963, when the S&P shed 2.8 per cent following the assassination of John F Kennedy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 4 per cent weaker at 7,949.09, below the psychologically significant 8,000 level, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 5.8 per cent lower at 1,440.86. The Vix, referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 23.9 per cent.Although the heaviest losses were among financials, which lost 8.8 per cent overall, several other sectors came under substanital selling pressure.The market’s sharp decline came in spite of hopes that the new president’s plan for a fresh stimulus package would give a boost to corporate earnings, particularly in the industrial and commodity sectors.Alcoa was among the heaviest hit blue chips outside the financial sector, down 11.5 per cent at $8.35 while materials lost 5.6 per cent overall. Industrials dropped 5 per cent.In addition to concern over the health of financial institutions, investors were also fearful over the prospect for corporate results in other sectors as fourth-quarter earnings season gets into full swing.Johnson & Johnson fell 1.2 per cent to $56.75 despite results that were slightly ahead of analyst expectations. The health care products group posted a 14 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit but forecast flat earnings for 2009.Chipmakers came under heavy selling pressure ahead of results from International Business Machines, off 3.5 per cent to $81.98.Defensive sectors, although firmly in the red, outperformed as investors sought safety. The consumer staples, utilities and healthcare sectors were off 1.5 per cent, 1.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.
648;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2009-01-09T17:22:18Z;Sterling makes a strong comeback;;The pound staged a comeback this week, posting a record weekly gain against the euro and putting in its strongest performance against the dollar since 1985.Sterling’s strong start in the first full trading week of 2009 came after a torrid run last year that saw it fall over 23 per cent against the euro and over 27 per cent against the dollar.The pound strengthened even though the Bank of England cut interest rates by 50 basis points to a record low of 1.5 per cent on Thursday.Although this was the consensus forecast, sterling rallied since a large minority of the market was expecting a deeper cut of 75 basis points or even 100bp.“The move seemed designed to support the UK economy while not being too large to put undue pressure on sterling,” said Brian Kim at UBS said.Sterling’s strong performance came despite a string of weak UK economic data, including further falls in UK house prices and news of a further drop in industrial production.Audrey Childe-Freeman at Brown Brothers Harriman said the pound was no longer reacting to negative news on the UK economy.“Bleak UK economic indicators continue to make the headlines, but this is all priced in the market now,” she said.But not all analysts believed the pound’s strong run could continue.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said the pound had benefited from the unwinding of some significant derivatives-related positioning built up in the run up to the end of last year.He said the Bank of England was still likely to cut rates further and did not rule out the prospect that the Bank, like the Federal Reserve, would commit to keeping interest rates low for an extended period as it attempted to revive the UK economy.“Given that such a move must seem a distinct possibility, we suspects sterling’s current strength may prove a temporary phenomenon,” he said.The pound rose to three week highs against both the euro and the dollar, rising 6.8 per cent to £0.8911 and 4.5 per cent to $1.5175, respectively over the week.
649;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-12-18T15:37:33Z;Sterling tumbles towards parity with euro;;The pound dropped to a fresh record low against the euro on Thursday, breaking through the 95p for the first time, as the prospect of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England continued to punish the currency.The pound was also undermined as a government report showed the UK’s budget deficit widened to a record level in November as tax revenue declined in the face of the worsening recession and takes the losses for the week against the euro to more than 6 per cent.Sterling’s fall followed comments from Charlie Bean, the Bank’s deputy governor, who said in an interview with the Financial Times that that zero interest rates were a possibility in the UK and that the government was likely to pump billions more pounds into the banking system as the economy kept slowing.This raised the the prospect that not only was the Bank likely to make a further aggressive cut to UK interest rates – which currently stand at 2 per cent – at its next meeting in January, but that it might follow the US and adopt a quantitative easing approach to monetary policy.This means once UK rates fall close to zero, the UK authority’s only option to provide a monetary stimulus is to pump money into the financial system.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said talk of UK quantitative easing was now becoming “mainstream”, and that the Bank of England had only refrained from a larger interest rate cut at its December meeting for fear of destabilising financial markets.The Bank’s stance stands in contrast to recent comments from European Central Bank officials, such as Germany’s Jürgen Stark, who has indicated that eurozone interest rates will only come down in small steps.European officials have also become increasingly critical of lax fiscal policy with Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, recently warning of the importance that the EU’s budget rules were respected.“It requires little imagination to conclude that in the face of simmering concern about the level of policy stimulus in the eurozone, the downside risk to UK interest rates clearly exceeds that for the eurozone,” said Mr Melllor.“With interest rate differentials a key guide to the performance of euro/sterling this rather suggests that there remains further upside despite the pair’s vault to all-time highs.”The pound dropped to a low of £0.9556 against the euro, its weakest level since the single currency’s inception in 1999, before regaining some poise to stand at £0.9436, still down 1.6 per cent on the session.The pound also fell 1.4 per cent to $1.5303 against the dollar.
650;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-12-16T19:50:25Z;Dollar slides after Fed cuts rates;;The dollar fell to a ten-week low against the euro on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by more than expected.The Fed said it was establishing a new target range of 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent for its main Fed funds lending rate. Analysts had expected the central bank to lower rates by 50 basis points to 0.5 per cent.The central bank said it would “employ all available tools” to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth, adding that weak economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the interest rates for some time.The dollar was already under pressure after weak US economic data earlier in the session.Figures showed that home construction in the US fell more than expected in November, while consumer prices also dropped more than forecast.Michael Woolfolk, at Bank of New York Mellon, said both sets of data fed into the sell-off in the dollar that has gathered pace in recent sessions on worries over the health of the US economy and the cost of the US government’s plans to alleviate the financial crisis.By mid-afternoon in New York, the dollar had fallen 1.4 per cent to Y89.31 against the yen, dropped 2.4 per cent to SFr1.1299 against the Swiss franc and lost 1.8 per cent to $1.3950 against the euro.The dollar also fell 0.7 per cent to $1.5416 against the pound.The euro received a boost, rising to a fresh record high against the pound, after hawkish comments from Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank.Mr Trichet said the ECB could not cut interest rates forever, strongly hinting that the central bank might keep rates on hold at its policy meeting in January.The German government announced that a second fiscal stimulus package would be conditional upon large companies pledging not to cut jobs.Steve Malyon, at Scotia Capital, said that while eurozone economic data were getting bleaker by the day, the region’s key policymakers – the ECB and the German government – were showing far less urgency than their transatlantic peers in dealing with the economic slowdown.“While we would remain long of the euro for now, this could come back to haunt the single currency in the months to come,” he said.The euro rose 1.1 per cent to £0.9042 against the pound.Elsewhere, the Norwegian krona dropped to a record low against the euro as investors awaited a decision on interest rates from the country’s central bank due today.The central bank was expected to cut interest rates by 100bp to 3.75 per cent after a sharp contraction in the Norwegian economy in the third quarter.Indeed, she said that more rate cuts were likely in 2009 given the recent deceleration Norwegian inflation.The krona fell 1.6 per cent to NKr9.5705 against the euro.

652;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-12-10T18:47:02Z;Pound plumbs new low against euro;;Sterling plumbed a fresh low against the euro on Wednesday, as the outlook for a sharply deteriorating UK economy sent investors scrambling from the currency.The pound extended two sessions of losses against the euro to slide 0.5 per cent to £0.8801, its lowest level since the single currency was created in 1999.The pound also hit a historic low against a wider basket of currencies, with sterling’s trade-weighted exchange rate index sinking to 79.7, its lowest level since records began in 1981.Sterling has declined almost 20 per cent against the euro since the start of this year, with weakness in recent economic data reinforcing speculation that the Bank of England will implement more cuts in interest rates.Simon Derrick, at BNY Mellon, said: “The data from the retail, housing and manufacturing sectors, as well as the savage discounting being seen on the high street ahead of Christmas, only serve to underline the message that the Bank Of England will likely take ‘further measures’ on monetary policy in the months ahead.”An improvement in risk appetite on hopes that a bail-out for the US carmakers sector was close to being approved led to some dollar weakness. Sterling rose 0.6 per cent against the greenback to $1.4834.High-yielding currencies also benefited from the bail-out optimism, regaining ground against the safe haven Japanese yen.The Australian dollar added 1 per cent to Y61.35, while the euro climbed 1.4 per cent to Y120.91. The Canadian dollar pared the previous session’s losses to rise 1.3 per cent to Y73.86.The yen fell against the US dollar, down 0.8 per cent at Y92.89, and slipped 1.3 per cent against the euro at Y120.76.Japan’s central bank said it was monitoring the effect of currency moves on the economy and flagged up the option of intervention if movements became excessive.But Meg Browne, at Brown Brothers Harriman, said the comment was “a statement of fact to lawmakers rather than a hint that intervention is imminent”.The New Zealand dollar outperformed, after the central bank played down the prospect of dramatic rate cuts. Alan Bollard, governor, warned: “Inflation rates in New Zealand remain very high.” The kiwi strengthened 2.1 per cent against the yen to Y50.87, and 1.3 per cent against the US dollar, at $0.5474.The South Korean won surged 2.5 per cent against the dollar to Won1393.70, breaking the 1400-level for the first time since November 17.The won, which has plummeted 35 per cent since the start of the year, was lifted by a four-day stock market rally which saw the benchmark Kospi index hit its highest level in four weeks.
653;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-12-09T21:54:47Z;Financials suffer losses as Wall St rally fades;;Financial stocks bore the brunt of the losses on Wall Street on Tuesday as a two-day rally fizzled out.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs dropped 8.2 per cent to $14.97 and 5.7 per cent to $72.77, respectively, amid nervousness of more write-downs ahead of fourth quarter earnings.KBW said their figures are “expected to be grim”. The broker cut its fourth quarter earnings forecast on Morgan Stanley from a profit to a loss of $0.19 a share.Fresh signs of stress in credit markets – the Treasury sold $30bn in four-week bills at zero per cent as investors fled to safety – added to the selling pressure. JPMorganfell 6.9 per cent to $33.96. Bank of New York Mellon was among several regional banks to sustain heavy losses, down10.2 per cent to $27.63.Discount brokers were in focus after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the sector with a “neutral” view. “Client activity could retract significantly in 2009,” Goldman said. OptionsXpress lost 8.5 per cent to $12.82 after the bank gave a “sell” recommendation and a $13 price target. “We expect 2009 to be the first year since 2002 when industry option volumes decline.”Profit warnings and downgrades added to the gloom and pushed the S&P 500 index 2.3 per cent lower to 888.67 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.7 per cent to 8,691.33 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.6 per cent to 1,547.34.Investors took profits in infrastructure stocks, which had enjoyed strong gains on the back of economic stimulus plans from president-elect Barack Obama.FedEx was the worst hit in the industrial sector, off 14.5 per cent – its worst show since 1987 – to $63.65 after the package shipping group issued a profit warning.United Parcel Service, another delivery group, lost 7 per cent to $54.51 and was also pushed lower from a bearish JPMorgan note.“The deterioration in express demand trends appear to be so sharp that the market weakness will overwhelm the benefit from DHL’s withdrawal from the US and also the support for earnings from falling fuel prices,” the bank said, and cut its recommendation on the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”.Transport stocks came under further pressure from Con-way, which dropped 13.9 per cent to $22.19 after the trucking group also slashed its earnings forecast.The financial sector led the retreat, down 4.9 per cent, amid concerns about more possible writedowns in the fourth quarter.Host Hotels was the biggest loser on the S&P, down 16.1 per cent to $7.15. The lodging sector came under pressure after Wachovia downgraded its recommendation on the sector to “underweight”.Still, there were rare signs of encouragement. The market entered positive territory during the morning and traders appeared encouraged by signs that some sectors had stopped reacting so adversely to bad news.Semiconductor stocks performed well in spite of a profit warning from Texas Instruments, which rose 4.9 per cent to $15.55.Investors also overlooked planned factory closures by Sony, the Japanese electronics group, and snapped up technology stocks on hopes they may have reached a nadir. The sector finished down 0.5 per cent.Better than feared results from Autozone lifted shares in the car parts retailer 6.9 per cent to $124.51.The energy sector had earlier provided the market with support but tracked the oil price lower to finish down.General Motors and Ford lost 4.7 per cent to $4.70 and 4.4 per cent to $3.23, respectively, amid fears political wrangling could delay a government bail-out of the ailing car industry.Food retailers came under pressure from Kroger, which warned fourth-quarter profit would be less than Wall Street had expected.Shares in the grocery chain lost 6.7 per cent to $25.47.Wal-Mart lost 3 per cent to $55.81 after the discounter agreed to pay $54.3m to settle a wage and hours-related lawsuit in Minnesota and suspended its share buy-back.Airlines were one of the worst performing sectors, off 7.2 per cent overall, after Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the International Air Transport Association, warned that the industry would suffer a $2.5bn net loss next year.
654;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-12-01T20:10:17Z;Withdrawals shape hedge funds’ future;;"Paul Tudor Jones is the stuff of legend in the hedge fund industry, where his fame ranks behind only George Soros, the man who broke the Bank of England.Mr Jones, a former cotton trader, predicted the 1987 crash and has never had a year where he lost money, until this year. He is only down 5 per cent, much better than the industry average and way ahead of stock markets.But even Mr Jones is not immune to the crisis facing the hedge fund industry: a loss of confidence by investors desperate for cash.Mr Jones’s Tudor Investment Corp is seeing heavy withdrawal requests – $1.4bn out of his $10bn main fund – prompting him to tell clients that they cannot have their money back until next March while he splits out toxic assets.Similar restrictions on withdrawals are being introduced across the industry as managers try to cope with heavy redemptions, estimated by Morgan Stanley at 15-30 per cent.The restrictions could lead investors to reshape the industry as they pay far closer attention to how easily a fund can sell its holdings to meet pay-out requests, something many ignored until recently.The restrictions, often justified by managers as a way to protect investors from themselves, could also prolong the agony of forced selling by the industry, hurting markets such as corporate credit where hedge funds are big investors.Derek Stewart, a director of Mellon Global Alternative Investments, part of Bank of New York Mellon, said as many as a third of the hedge funds in which MGAI’s Sanctuary funds invest have restricted withdrawals.“Managers are doing this for positive reasons,” he said. “They don’t want to be forced sellers of securities that are already trading at historically low prices.”The restrictions are ­having big knock-on effects, however, as investors, ­unable to redeem from the underperforming funds they want to dump, have to ask for cash back from more successful funds.“We know some very good funds that are up this year and they are seeing 20-30 per cent redemptions just because they are still open,” says Gary Vaughan-Smith, partner at Silver Street Capital, a London fund of hedge funds.As well as Tudor, some of the biggest names in the hedge fund industry have imposed a “gate”, restricting withdrawals to a certain percentage of the fund; suspended withdrawals entirely; put hard-to-sell assets into “sidepockets”, meaning investors can sell only that part of their holding still in the main fund; or, at the extreme, given investors a part holding in toxic assets rather than cash.Those shutting down, restricting or delaying repayment to investors include three funds from GLG Partners, until recently London’s biggest manager; Centaurus Capital, a large London activist; Tosca Fund, a well-known London financial sector specialist; two funds from Highbridge, the biggest hedge fund manager, controlled by JPMorgan; London Diversified’s two main funds; and Platinum Grove, run by Myron Scholes, winner of the Nobel memorial prize for economics and co-founder of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund which blew up in 1998.Castle Hall Alternatives, the consultancy, last month compiled a list of 73 funds reported to have taken action, and since then dozens more have shut or restricted withdrawals.But estimates of the levels of restrictions vary widely, from just 6 per cent at one big prime broker to 50 per cent from Union Bancaire Privée, one of the biggest investors in hedge funds. UBP says most of those restrictions involve sidepockets.Apart from UBP, a dozen or so hedge fund investors polled by the FT estimated levels of restrictions in the 20-35 per cent range – although reactions were mixed.“In the past we all believed that if somebody had put up a gate then they were out of business,” said Patrick Fenal, chief executive of Unigestion, a Swiss-based asset manager with €2.2bn ($2.78bn) invested in hedge funds. “That’s not the case any more.”CQS, Michael Hintze’s London fixed income manager, last week consulted investors in its flagship fund over whether it should be given the power to impose a gate, in case market conditions declined further.Vineet Kapur, head of capital introductions at Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage, says redemption restrictions are common at funds specialising in fixed income, convertible bond, distressed debt and special situations.But he says in equity long/short funds, which bet on rises or falls in share prices, there have been “negligible” levels of restructurings, and funds have 30-50 per cent cash – which could have a big impact on equity markets when it is reinvested.“Redemptions [in long/short] have been lower than what the markets were expecting,” he said. “As a result the equity long/short managers are sitting on significant net cash.”“This could set up for a huge rally. Valuations are starting to look cheap and we have all this cash sloshing around that needs to find a home.”But many investors are going to be wary of hedge funds for some time. While institutional investors such as pension funds appear committed to the industry, at least for now, many wealthy clients have been surprised to find restrictions on withdrawals, particularly in funds of hedge funds, often used to park cash.“This will have a huge impact on the hedge fund industry,” Mr Fenal said. “People will now think twice before they invest and will want to understand their liquidity risk, which they didn’t really understand before.“It won’t be the end of hedge funds per se, but it may be the end of mediocre hedge funds.”"

656;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-11-23T22:41:06Z;Market havoc forces urgent rebalancing;;"The virtual collapse of global equity markets has wrought havoc on pension funds in more ways than one. Apart from dealing with huge losses, the funds are suffering a cash squeeze as their portfolios are becoming increasingly unbalanced amid illiquid markets.The equity component of their portfolios has fallen precipitously, which means funds with a 60 per cent strategic allocation to equities now have an exposure of
50 per cent or less.“This is a real crisis . . . funds are struggling to rebalance and having huge difficulties,” says Mark Keleher, the chief executive of Mellon transition management, a unit of BNY Mellon that advises pension funds.Global equity markets in the year to date have fallen by 40-50 per cent around the globe, but fixed income markets are down by only
4-5 per cent, he says.“Fixed income markets are incredibly illiquid, so plans are unable to sell their fixed income securities to rebalance or to raise the cash they need for beneficiary payments and ongoing expenses,” says Mr Keleher.The funds are being forced to sell equities, their only liquid asset, to meet their cash needs. However, their equities portfolios are already underweight, so
selling down further is resulting in an even greater imbalance.Most pension funds have strict asset allocation rules set by their trustees, and the fund managers must work to stay within these.At present, the funds are taking on extra risk relative to their benchmarks by the involuntary reduction in equity weightings, and the risk is growing as equities are being sold down further.Mr Keleher estimates a fund that had shifted to 50 per cent equities, compared with a previous weighting of 60 per cent, would have taken on more than 500 basis points, or
5 per cent additional annualised risk, in terms of the risk of deviating from its benchmark.One US pension fund, with $6bn (£4bn, €4.8bn) in assets, has added $96m in risk within the past month as a result of its asset allocation rapidly falling out of whack, he says.The situation is becoming increasingly urgent with every passing month, as the funds must come up with cash each month to pay their retired members, and are selling shares to do so.Many funds have been looking into solving the problem by rebalancing synthetically, and buying derivatives to create extra equities exposure.Mr Keleher says Mellon has created well over $1bn in such synthetic equities in the past few weeks, with a pipeline “in the billions of dollars”.However, although equity futures are relatively cheap at present, and it is easy to create such synthetic exposure, many pension funds have rules that prohibit the use of the derivatives needed to create this synthetic
exposure.Others are wary of using derivatives given the role of such complex instruments in the recent financial crisis and the counterparty risk involved.“There is always a concern at the trustee level,” says Mr Keleher, who adds that several hundred billion dollars’ worth of equities would need to be created using derivatives, in order to rebalance pension funds’ portfolios.“On the other hand, how can you rebalance the portfolio right now without using derivatives?” he asks.Another focus of imbalance is the funds’ commodities and alternative assets exposure, which has similarly grown as a proportion of the total.Buy-out funds and private equity are not subject to the daily changes in asset valuation that stock market holdings are, so – technically at least – they are holding their value.At the same time, the remainder of the funds’ portfolios is falling in value, leaving alternative assets needing to be pruned. Pension funds, endowments and foundations have begun offloading their private equity holdings in recent months and this is likely to continue for some months, say industry executives.The nascent secondary market in private equity is starting to flourish as a result of the funds’ looking for quick exits from their holdings.The price of such holdings has been discounted as the underlying value of assets has fallen, and almost every endowment has been selling on the secondary market in recent months. The Harvard endowment, for example, is unloading $1.5bn in private equity holdings through the secondary market.Another possibility for the funds would be to revalue their private equity or buyout holdings. Some, such as the Lehman Brothers’ private equity portfolio, have recently been sold in the secondary market at 50 per cent of their value.For pension funds, this means holding such investments on their books at full value might no longer make sense. Either way, a markdown of alternative assets appears likely for most funds, whether through a sale at a reduced price, or through an internal
revaluation."
657;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-11-21T02:13:11Z;JPMorgan cuts first of an expected 3,000 jobs;;JPMorgan, the investment banking division of JPMorgan Chase, began what is believed to be a 10 per cent reduction in its workforce on Thursday.The bank, which absorbed Bear Stearns several months ago, has managed to avoid most of the carnage in the financial services industry this year. The job cuts, which will happen across all divisions of the investment bank, could be close to 3,000. Currently the bank employs about 29,000 people.According to the bank, its headcount reduction had begun in the equities department and would be followed by cuts in other divisions of the bank, including commodities, sales and trading and investment banking.They come against a backdrop of massive cutbacks in the financial services industry. Rival Bank of New York Mellon also announced on Thursday it would be cutting about 1,800 from its workforce, about 4 per cent of the total globally. Worldwide, the financial services sector is believed to have shed more than 150,000 jobs due to the current downturn – not counting the most recent announcements.This week, Vikram Pandit, Citigroup chief executive, announced 52,000 redundancies. Last month, Goldman Sachs confirmed a 10 per cent reduction in staff, which would bring its employee roster from 32,500 to about 29,000.When it filed for bankruptcy two months ago, Lehman Brothers employed 28,000 worldwide. Barclays Capital offered positions to several thousand Lehman employees in the US, and Nomura has retained thousands of Lehman employees overseas.According to JPMorgan, the bank had cuts in the middle of the year, after the acquisition of Bear Stearns, which had employed 14,000. After JPMorgan absorbed several thousand Bear employees, some of its own people became redundant.The reason for the current round of job cuts, according to the company, is that each unit of the bank has finalised earnings estimates for 2009, which, for the most part, will be down from the current year’s totals.Depending on how much smaller the earnings projections of each of the bank’s units were for 2009, head count was expected to be lowered accordingly, JPMorgan said.Job cuts at the commercial bank, JPMorgan Chase, are expected to be minimal. The mortgage department was reduced in size this year, but commercial lending has held up, as have private banking and asset management.It is thought the credit card unit might have some reductions, owing to an expected decline.
658;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-11-14T17:13:10Z;Sterling buffeted from all sides;;The pound tumbled to a record low against the euro and dropped below $1.50 against the dollar for the first time in six years this week as traders abandoned the currency.The pound also fell to its lowest level for 13 years on a trade-weighted basis after the Bank of England – which last week delivered a shock 150 basis point cut in interest rates – said the UK economy had fallen into recession and signalled more sharp rate cuts.Adding to the pressure on sterling were increasing signs that international investors were abandoning UK assets after aggressive selling of gilts since mid-September.The pound fell 6 per cent to $1.4734 against the dollar over the week, its weakest level in 6½ years, dropped 5.6 per cent to £0.8595 versus the euro and lost 7.6 per cent to Y142.26 against the yen.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said the pound’s fall was starting to overshadow the events of September 1992, when sterling was ejected from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.He said then, as now, the pound was hit because investors believed that the UK authorities would take drastic action to ease monetary policy in the face of a steepening recession.Following the Bank of England’s aggressive interest rate cut and subsequent comments, UK interest rates are now below eurozone rates for the first time since the creation of the single currency in 1999. Meanwhile, the yield spread between German and UK government bonds stands at its highest level in more than a decade.Mr Derrick said the only question that needed to be asked was whether speculation over the future path of interest rates in the UK had run its course.“Unfortunately, we suspect not. Talk will undoubtedly continue for at least the remainder of this year about how far and how fast the Bank of England could cut,” he said. “With the UK still seen as the G7 nation with the furthest to go in cutting rates, the downward pressure on the currency is therefore likely to remain in force.”Meanwhile, the yen and the dollar were the main beneficiaries as fears over a sharp slowdown in the global economy triggered further deleveraging on asset markets. Data revealed bigger-than-expected drops in output growth in China and Japan. Meanwhile, figures showed the eurozone fell into recession in the third quarter and US retail sales dropped more sharply than expected last month.This benefited the yen and dollar as US and Japanese investors repatriated cash and investors liquidated assets that had previously been funded by selling the low-yielding currencies.Fiona Lake at Goldman Sachs said she expected continued deleveraging to dictate the near-term direction in the FX market.Over the week, the dollar rose 0.5 per cent to $1.2670 against the euro, gained 0.9 per cent to SFr1.1890 on the Swiss franc and was up 2.5 per cent to $0.6590 against the Australian dollar.The yen fared even better, climbing 1.8 per cent to Y96.54 against the dollar on the week, rising 2.3 per cent to Y142.26 against the euro and gaining 4.1 per cent to Y63.65 against the Australian dollar.Elsewhere, the Brazilian real dropped 6.2 per cent to R$2.2810 against the dollar over the week. The Turkish lira lost 4.8 per cent to TL1.6200 and the South Korean won fell 5.3 per cent to Won1,392.50.
659;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Money funds wait anxiously for Fed plan;;Investors have pulled more than $400bn from money market prime funds in the past two months, leaving the funds waiting urgently for a Federal Reserve rescue plan to help them sell commercial paper to meet redemptions.The Fed said on Monday that it would begin the rescue plan on November 24, a few weeks later than planned. Money market funds are low-risk, low-return funds that normally invest heavily in commercial paper, a type of debt used by businesses to meet short-term funding needs.The funds currently hold $3,600bn (£2,335bn, €2,900bn) in commercial paper and have been struck by high redemptions and illiquid markets, making it difficult for them to sell their paper to pay out investors.The Fed plan, announced on October 21, will see it buy up to $600bn in certain companies’ short-term debt, as a way to provide liquidity in the credit markets and help money market funds find it easier to sell their commercial paper. Money market funds will be able to sell short-term debt issued by 50 financial institutions to the Fed programme, called the Money Market Investor Funding Facility.The Fed said the programme might over time be extended to buy debt from other investors besides money market funds.A separate Fed programme to buy commercial paper in the markets has already begun operating.Money market funds, which were already struggling, went into crisis in September when one fund, the Reserve Primary, “broke the buck” – meaning that the value of investors’ money fell below the amount put in.Investors pulled $200bn from money funds in a week following the news. Since then, Government funds – private money market funds that invest in treasuries – have had small inflows but prime funds, which invest in commercial paper, have continued to suffer outflows, as investors sought safety.Prime funds saw their assets fall by $400bn to $1,600bn in the two months to November 4, according to iMoneyNet. The percentage of these assets represented by the lowest-risk commercial paper has fallen over the period to 41 per cent, from 44 per cent previously, as the funds have attempted to reduce their holdings in commercial paper.The funds have also been buying only paper with short durations. The average paper held has a duration of less than 40 days, according to money market fund managers. That compares with more than 60 days in more normal times.The funds’ parent companies in the past year have spent more than $10bn in loans, guarantees and cash payments to prop up their funds and prevent them from “breaking the buck”, and to cover redemptions.The Bank of New York Mellon said in a regulatory filing on Friday that it might need to spend another $300m to cover losses in its money funds, relating mostly to debt issued by Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt in September. BNY Mellon has already spent more than $700m propping up its money market funds.
660;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Sterling hits 12-year low on gilts sell-off;Signs investors are deserting British assets;Sterling fell to a 12-year low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday and briefly fell to its lowest level against the euro since the single currency was introduced amid signs that foreign investors are deserting British assets.Since mid-September UK fixed income instruments, which consist of gilts, corporate bonds, shorter maturing bills, and mortgage securities have seen extremely heavy outflows, according to data from the Bank of New York Mellon. This has coincided with a sharp fall in sterling.According to the bank’s data, the net outflows of foreign investment from UK fixed income instruments seen over the past two months wiped out about 75 per cent of the net purchases that were seen between November 2004 and mid-September 2008.In contrast, the outflows from eurozone debt in the past two months equalled about 25 per cent of the inflows between November 2004 and mid-September 2008, while those from US and Japanese paper added up to a more modest 15 per cent of prior purchases.The yields on gilts have not risen significantly yet in response to Gordon Brown’s pledge to increase borrowing to pay for tax cuts, but analysts said the loss of confidence in the UK could limit the government’s scope to deliver a fiscal stimulus as it struggles to attract funds from overseas, potentially pushing up borrowing costs to lure investors.With Britain’s sizable trade deficit, financial assets need to attract foreign buyers to prevent sterling from falling. Until last year, the boom in mortgage-backed securities and the attractiveness of gilts attracted huge inflows of foreign cash.But when Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, likened the UK to a vulnerable emerging market last month pointing out that foreign inflows to the banking sector had “fallen sharply”, he pulled the rug out from under sterling.Since his speech in late October, the pound has fallen more than 6 per cent against the currencies of Britain’s main trading partners.More than 5,800 job losses were revealed on Tuesday with Virgin Media, Taylor Wimpey and Yell all announcing large cuts.Sterling fell another 1.2 per cent against the US dollar to $1.5425 and hit a record low of £0.8214 against the euro. The Bank of England’s trade-weighted sterling index slumped to 84.5, its weakest level since 1996.Analysts attributed the loss of confidence in Britain’s currency to worries about the UK economy.Simon Derrick, a strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said on Tuesday: “There could be a raft of reasons for the outflows, such as worries over the UK economy, which is expected to see the worst recession of all the G7 nations, or concerns over the rising funding requirements to recapitalise some of the UK banks.”The loss of confidence has not directly hit demand for gilts yet but Robert Stheeman, chief executive of the Debt Management Office, which runs gilt issuance, has warned that the government could face problems securing enough demand for its bonds as issuance is likely to rise to £110bn this financial year, nearly double the figure of £58.5bn last year.
661;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;View of the Day: China tests market mettle;;Any revival in market confidence triggered by China’s fiscal stimulus package will quickly be put to the test, believes Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.“If positive sentiment is to derive a solid footing, then China’s announcement that it will invest $568bn over the next two years in infrastructure, reconstruction and housing may be instrumental given the country’s role in underpinning global economic growth in recent years,” he says.“However, the collapse in market confidence towards the end of last week, in spite of further moves to deliver liquidity by the world’s central banks, pointed to doubts about the effectiveness of traditional economic policy at this juncture.”Mr Mellor notes that with global demand continuing to decline, China’s exports are at risk of drying up and it is unclear whether infrastructure spending can mop up the resultant surplus labour.Moreover, he says, it should be borne in mind that massive infrastructure spending can sometimes be a dual-edged sword, with any failure to lift growth a fiscal headache in the making.“China’s announcement could yet prove a defining moment in the path of the global economy.“But even if it does, the inevitable and continued deterioration in global economic data in the meantime may prove to be a rather overwhelming test of the market’s mettle.”
662;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-31T18:36:04Z;Wary investors fuel forex jitters;;Foreign exchange markets experienced extreme volatility in October as recession-wary investors continued to shy away from risk and parked cash in the relative safety of yen and dollars.Analysts said the financial crisis hit currency markets with a crunch in October. Concerns for some currencies were such that equity markets took a beating and policy responses from some of the world’s leading organisations were necessary.“It’s like every major currency crisis that’s happened in the last 30 years all happened at once,” said Simon Derrick, of Bank of New York Mellon.Worst hit were the emerging markets, where massive selling of equities left indices at multi-year lows.The accompanying currency declines prompted action from the International Monetary Fund, which helped a number of countries including Hungary, Ukraine and Iceland. Hungary’s forint at its worst point last week was down 18 per cent against the euro on the month but rallied 5 per cent this week to Ft260.81 – down 8 per cent over the month.Against the dollar it was more dramatic – down 19.7 per cent in spite of this week’s rally. “Aid packages from the IMF and other organisations should substantially reduce the risk of defaults and currency collapses,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, of Commerzbank.It was a volatile month for the majors, too. The pound fell to a record low against the euro, which had its worst monthly decline against the dollar, while the yen’s rapid appreciation raised the prospect of intervention in the FX market by central banks.Deleveraging gained pace throughout the month as margin calls on funds forced the selling of stocks, commodities and corporate bonds. This pushed the dollar higher as US investors repatriated their cash into the Treasury market while the yen found itself the target of funds looking for safety in its low yield and current account surplus.The dollar also had help from the Federal Reserve, which drew praise from analysts for its proactive approach in trying to avert a severe recession.Its half-point interest rate cut on Wednesday helped stabilise equity markets and increased speculation that the Bank of England and European Central Bank will follow suit next week.Sterling fell 9 per cent against the dollar, its worst monthly fall since October 1992 – the month after the pound’s expulsion from the exchange rate mechanism. This week, the pound rose 1.8 per cent to $1.6212.The euro, meanwhile, was down 9.6 per cent, its biggest monthly decline. It, too, rallied this week, standing at $1.2749 Friday, up 1.6 per cent on the week.The euro hit a record high against sterling last week at £0.8195. But the pound finished this week, and the month of October, better off against the single currency. By late trade in London on Friday, the pound stood at $0.7861, up almost 2 per cent on the week and 0.6 per cent higher on the month.Gains for Japan’s currency were even more spectacular in spite of its losses this week. The Bank of Japan on Friday acknowledged the work being done by other central banks as it lowered its own main rate by 20 basis points to 0.3 per cent.During October, the yen climbed more than 16 per cent against the euro to Y125.01 and 16 per cent versus sterling to Y158.66. It also rose 7.5 per cent against the dollar to Y98.06.

664;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-30T18:16:56Z;Dollar resumes its upward trajectory;;The dollar staged a comeback on Thursday as figures showed that the US economy contracted by less than expected in the third quarter. Data revealed US GDP fell by 0.3 per cent, better than the forecast 0.5 per cent drop.The figures helped the dollar sustain a rally that began in European trade with the US currency pulling back from early sharp losses.The dollar had been under pressure after the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its main lending rate by 50 basis points to 1 per cent on Wednesday boosted risk appetite and global equity markets. This helped to sustain the reversal of recent safe-haven flows, with investors making tentative moves back into riskier, higher yielding trades, leaving the low-yielding dollar and Japanese yen on the back foot.However, Michael Woolfolk, of Bank of New York Mellon, said that, with the event risk of the Fed’s interest rate decision and the US GDP figures out of the way, investors have now returned to the trend of dollar and yen buying that was prevalent last week.By midday in New York, the dollar rose 0.7 per cent to $1.2875 against the euro, was up 0.7 per cent to $1.6278 against the pound and rose 1.4 per cent to SFr1.1431 against the Swiss franc. It also gained 0.7 per cent to Y98.05 against the yen.Meanwhile, the yen, which sold off aggressively in early trade, eased just 0.1 per cent to Y126.43 against the euro and dropped 0.2 per cent to Y160.15 against the pound.Mansoor Mohi-uddin, of UBS, said he believed the month-end rally in equities that has put the low-yielding safe-haven dollar, yen and Swiss franc under pressure was unlikely to last.He said the threat of currency intervention from the Bank of Japan, new plans to inject liquidity into emerging markets and the re-allocation into stocks by assets managers left underweight by the recent fall in equities all helped to improve investor sentiment.However, Mr Mohi-uddin said central to the rally in asset markets had been the massive interest rates cuts by central banks across the globe so far this month, which has constituted the greatest global easing of monetary policy since the early 1980s.“October’s global easing has been enormous and more easing is likely to come in the next few months,” he said. “But the global economy will deteriorate much further next year. As a result, we continue to favour the low-yielding safe-haven currencies.”Elsewhere, emerging market currencies put in a mixed performance after strong gains in the previous session. Against the dollar, the Korean won surged 10 per cent to Won1,237.00, but the South African rand eased 2.1 per cent to R9.9490 while the Turkish lira fell 2.3 per cent to TL1.5442 and the Hungarian forint lost 2.8 per cent to Ft202.95.
665;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;View of the Day: Policymakers repeat history;;Should investors be concerned that the policy stance being adopted by central banks risks repeating the mistakes of seven years ago?Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon points out that expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts across the globe have risen sharply in recent days.“This would seem to be the right policy response to the current crisis,” he says.“However, it is also difficult not to recall that it was the availability of cheap dollars – and other currencies – from the start of 2002 onwards that fuelled so many of the extreme market bubbles that ended up unravelling this year,” he adds.Mr Derrick says that perhaps the most telling signal with regard to an official stance towards monetary policy came on Wednesday evening from Alistair Darling, the UK chancellor of the exchequer.“He noted that the Bank had ‘discretion’ over how long it took to hit its inflation targets and “can support, in line with its statutory requirement, the government’s wider economic objectives.“In other words, forget inflation targeting for the moment and focus on growth instead.”Mr Derrick suggests the real clue to the forces currently in play comes from a strong rebound in the price of gold over the past week – “given that the yellow metal has provided the most consistent indicator of concerns about currencies, particularly the dollar – as stores of value”.
666;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-21T16:07:53Z;Pensions have billions in toxic assets;;Pension funds across Europe, Asia and North America stand to lose hundreds of billions of dollars from investment in so-called “toxic” assets. (PDF)Concern is also growing that clients of European private banks have also been left holding tainted mortgage-backed assets, potentially triggering a wave of litigation.The International Monetary Fund has estimated that worldwide losses from structured products such as collateralised debt and loan obligations, asset-backed securities, commercial paper-backed securities and structured investment vehicles will hit $945bn (£546bn, €705bn), with some private estimates far higher still.Banks have so far announced more than $400bn of writedowns related to these toxic assets, with much of the rest likely to be held by pension funds and wealthy individuals as well as insurance companies.Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, a consultancy, calculates that structured products such as CDOs, CLOs, ABS, SIVs, CPBS and capital protection products accounted for 8 per cent of the $15,000bn of global pension fund assets when the credit crunch hit last year. Of this, up to $700bn could be toxic.“There is about $400bn to $700bn of this toxic waste sitting on the balance sheets of pension funds, especially in Denmark, Germany, France, Sweden, Japan and the US. As a percentage of total pension assets it’s not great, but at the margin it’s a huge sum of money. It’s localised to some pension funds but for them it’s going to be a problem,” said Mr Rajan, who argued that the triple A ratings once enjoyed by much of this toxic alphabet soup would have lured pension funds in.“On the continent and Japan equity culture is less powerful than bond culture and the idea of a triple A rating is a powerful driver, as it is in the US.”Defined contribution pension schemes may also be caught up in the maelstrom with, for example, members of Danish schemes often buying monthly deferred annuities that may have been backed by assets that have now plunged in value.However, the UK appears to have escaped relatively unscathed. David Norgrove, chairman of the Pensions Regulator, said a survey of the UK’s 80 largest schemes found “relatively limited exposure” to toxic assets.For US funds, there appears to be some uncertainty as to whether they could benefit from the government-sponsored troubled asset relief programme.The US Treasury told FTfm that, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, it can purchase “any troubled asset if it determines that is in the interest of market stability”.Jenny Eller, partner at Groom Law Group, a US law firm that represents a host of major pension plan sponsors, said: “It seems to us that it is broad enough to cover pension plans,” but she added that this was still to be confirmed.“From the Treasury viewpoint they could say pension plans are long-term investors so it doesn’t make any sense to purchase this stuff from them,” said Ms Eller.Mr Rajan forecast that a number of US pension plans would be likely to launch class actions against the investment banks that sold them toxic assets.Ray Soudah, founder of Millenium Associates, a Swiss advisory firm, said legal action was also likely against private banks.“There are huge portfolios of structured products in private banks. Some of those have collapsed and are worthless and some of them cannot be marked to market,” he said. “Clients are saying ‘You did not tell me all the risks. I want my money back’.”Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank has already filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, BNY Mellon and two rating agencies over losses resulting from a collapsed $6bn SIV managed by London-based Cheyne Capital – paper that also appears to have been placed by private banks with their clients. “A lot of [Cheyne Finance paper] was sold to private banks’ clients. I think we have a contingent problem of huge proportions,” said Mr Soudah.
667;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-16T21:04:29Z;Wall Street stocks soar in late trade;;US stocks endured extreme volatility on Thursday and a late-afternoon rally pushed the market sharply higher, led by energy groups even as oil slid below $70 a barrel.The S&P 500 had fallen as much as 1.9 per cent after the release of grim economic data.But, in the last hour of trading, stocks rebounded. Wednesday had seen the worst sell-off since 1987.The benchmark index closed up 4.3 per cent at 946.43, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent at 8,979.26. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 5.5 per cent higher at 1,717.71.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up as much as 17.2 per cent to pass yet another grim milestone, reaching above 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. It finished down 2.9 per cent at 67.25.Stocks were pushed lower by economic data that showed industrial production had endured the worst monthly decline since 1974, and factory activity in parts of the country had crashed to an 18-year low.Consumer stocks were among the winners from the late-afternoon rally as some traders bet that oil’s slide below $70 could offer hard- pressed Americans at least some relief.Macy’s closed up 16.1 per cent at $10.05 having fallen as much as 11.7 per cent. Oil’s slide to an intraday low of $68.57 a barrel, while a symptom of global slowdown could nonetheless put “cash back into people’s pockets”, said Bill Stone, investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.Yet the energy sector, down as much as 8.1 per cent after data showed crude and gasoline inventories rose sharply last week, also rebounded and was up 7.8 per cent by the close.Financials were the laggards of the day, but still up 1.7 per cent, following a raft of heavy writedowns and losses from banks.Citigroup rose as much as 4 per cent but later tumbled to stand 2 per cent lower at $15.90 as investors weighed cost-cutting progress with writedowns of $4.4bn in the securities and banking division and weak revenues from its credit card unit.Merrill Lynch rose 0.6 per cent to $18.35. The bank, which is being taken over by Bank of America, reported a worse-than-expected net loss of $7.5bn, mostly due to write­downs and credit losses on complex debt securities.A host of regional banks also reported losses. Bank of New York Mellon rose 6.3 per cent to $31.08 even after costs to bail out funds hurt by Lehman Brothers’s bankruptcy dented third-quarter profits, which fell more than expected.Huntington and BB&T, which also reported downbeat figures, added 10.2 per cent to $9.48 and gained 3.4 per cent to $33.26, respectively.Insurers endured sharp declines after Fitch warned it may cut ratings on some. Hartford Financial Services dropped 11.9 per cent to $28.86, respectively.The falls came even though the rate at which banks lend to each other, measured by overnight dollar Libor, fell sharply.Elsewhere, airlines managed gains even after Southwest Airlines reported its first quarterly net loss since 1991, as oil slid below $70 a barrel.Southwest climbed 8 per cent to $12.49, while Delta Air Lines advanced 18.8 per cent to $8.64. “The leverage from the plunge in fuel prices is huge,” Credit Suisse said.Peabody Energy was a stand-out winner in the energy sector, up 18.3 per cent to $28.68 on the back of well-received third-quarter figures.Technology was up 4.8 per cent overall. Ebay fell 2.4 per cent to $14.97 after the online retailer forecast its first quarterly sales decline after the bell on Wednesday.Google, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices gained 4.1 per cent to $353.02, 3.7 per cent to $91.52 and 5.4 per cent to $4.12 respectively.After the bell, the trio reported better than expected results and the shares bounced 8.2 per cent, 0.7 per cent and fell 2.9 per cent, respectively, in after- hours trade.Food groups were mixed after Hershey’s results. The chocolate group, which rose 6.9 per cent to $35.24, boosted third-quarter profits but warned of slowing sales growth next year.
668;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-15T18:40:23Z;Three big US banks unveil $2.6bn in profits;;Three of the nine big banks due to receive capital injections from the US government reported total third-quarter profits of more than $2.6bn on Wednesday, highlighting the different needs of companies receiving assistance under the rescue plan.Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, which are to receive $25bn each in government funds, said they earned $1.64bn and $527m, respectively, during the period, while State Street, which is to receive $2bn in federal money, put its net profit at $477m.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, said his bank did not need the capital injection and acknowledged that the Treasury plan might benefit weaker competitors more. But he said JPMorgan did not want to stand in the way of an initiative that benefited the banking system as a whole.“The plan may well have asymmetrical benefits …but what is good for the system is good for JPMorgan,” he said. “The Treasury plan and all of the things they have done recently, is very powerful stuff that will eventually help to unclog the system.”Mr Dimon said money markets and other frozen parts of the financial system could start to thaw, adding: “You will see some easing in certain critical areas in the next couple of weeks.”JPMorgan’s profits were down 84 per cent from $3.4bn in the same quarter of last year. Earnings at Wells fell 24 per cent, but rose 33 per cent at State Street.Michael Cavanagh, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, warned that future earnings would remain under pressure due to the deteriorating financial health of US consumers and “recessionary conditions”.“Times ahead are going to be tough,” he said.Howard Atkins, Wells chief financial officer, said his bank intended to raise $20bn in equity from private sources to finance its pending acquisition of Wachovia.Under the government’s $250bn capital-injection plan, about half the money will go to nine banks seen as central to the financial system. In addition to JPMorgan, Wells and State Street, they are Bank of America, Merrill Lynch (now being acquired by BofA), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon.Experts say it was important for big banks to join at once to avoid potential “stigma” problems for companies receiving government funds.
669;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-14T23:48:39Z;US injection lifts confidence;;"The world banking system showed signs of pulling back from the brink of disaster on Tuesday with a tangible easing of stress in credit markets as the US government unveiled a historic rescue plan for its banks.The plan included $250bn for bank recapitalisation and a sovereign guarantee for new bank debt – the most sweeping government intervention in the US financial sector since the Great Depression.“Government owning a stake in any private US company is objectionable to most Americans, me included,” said Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary. “Yet the alternative of leaving businesses and consumers without access to financing is totally unacceptable.”Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, said even the massive intervention announced on Tuesday may not be the final word. “Our strategy will continue to evolve and be refined as we adapt to new developments and the inevitable setbacks.”He added: “We will not step down until we have achieved our goals of repairing and reforming our financial system, and thereby restoring prosperity.”Investors signalled growing confidence that the biggest US banks would survive the crisis. The cost of buying insurance against defaults by some big US banks fell by record amounts, while remaining above normal levels.Interbank loan rates starting on Wednesday also eased, though modestly, while the yield on safe short-term US Treasuries moved higher, as risk appetite improved.However, the stock market failed to build on its historic rally on Monday amid concerns that the financial rescue might have come too late to prevent a deep recession. The S&P 500 fell 0.53 per cent. The head of a leading financial firm told the FT: “I still expect a severe recession, but this may be enough to unclog the financial system.”As part of the plan, the government will inject half the total, $125bn, into nine banks – Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street.Under the government’s take-it-or-leave-it offer, Bank of America (including Merrill Lynch, which it is acquiring), JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, will each get $25bn in government funds, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley $10bn each, and Bank of New York Mellon and State Street between $2bn and $3bn each.In return, the US government will take non-voting preference shares paying 5 per cent interest, stepping up to 9 per cent after five years, and will also take warrants for common stock equal to 15 per cent of its preference share investment.All institutions will get cash on the same terms, and the cost of securing loan guarantees will also be the same for stronger and weaker banks. Banks taking
government equity will be subject to some mild executive pay constraints.However, they will be able to carry on paying dividends, unlike in the UK, although they will not be able to increase them.All other US financial institutions eligible for the plan have to decide by November 14 whether to participate on these terms.US legislators were broadly supportive of the move, even though it marked a radical shift from the original focus of the $700bn US rescue plan signed into law this month, which was sold as a troubled asset purchase plan.The US announcement followed similar moves by the UK and by European governments. Equity markets in Europe continued their advance on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed up 3.2 and 3.1 per cent, respectively.The dollar, which fell sharply on Monday, declined further."
670;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-14T20:09:53Z;US forced to follow the European bandwagon;;The US bank rescue plan is in broad terms the same plan invented by the UK a week ago and adopted by other European nations on Monday: a recapitalisation scheme coupled with loan guarantees for banks and expanded deposit insurance.This looked unlikely as recently as the weekend, when the US government hoped to pursue a slightly different mix of policies, including implicit guarantees and direct funding of financial institutions through Federal Reserve purchases of commercial paper – short-term, unsecured corporate debt – in place of loan guarantees.However, once bank loan guarantees spread across Europe, the US had no choice but to follow suit, in spite of concerns among senior policymakers that this could speed the collapse of the large non-bank financial sector that competes with its lenders.Indeed, some experts think the US has de facto accepted the transformation of its complex and diverse financial system into one based on a relatively small number of universal banks on the European model.By putting in government capital before the entire banking system was in ruins – sooner than in most previous financial crises around the world – policymakers hope to engineer a more rapid turnround.The terms of the US recapitalisation plan are much more favourable to the banks and their shareholders than the UK proposal. The US terms favour weak banks by establishing the same terms for all, regardless of capital strength.Experts say getting the core group of top banks to sign up immediately for half the $250bn (£143bn, €183bn) was essential. It removed uncertainty over their share prices: dealt with the “co-ordination” problem, avoiding destabilising swings in relative capital strength: and the “stigma” problem, reluctance to go to the government for help for fear that this would be taken as a sign of weakness.Most importantly, it mitigated the risk that the $250bn would be too widely spread across the vast US financial sector to make a real difference to the core financial institutions.Still, questions remain as to whether $250bn will be enough. Relative to the size of capital injections elsewhere and scale of the US financial system, the fund is arguably on the small side.At the same time diverting at least $250bn away from the $700bn fund created to finance the purchase of toxic assets raises doubts over the effectiveness of that programme.The US Treasury can transfer assets from bank balance sheets to the government balance sheet at a smaller scale.The focus of the rescue effort is now the recapitalisation and loan guarantee plan. In effect the US has decided to circle the wagons around a core group of nine banks – Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BNY Mellon and State Street. These banks will not be allowed to fail, and the US government will rely on them to provide the bedrock of ongoing lending in the economy, while trying to avoid any of them gaining dominant market share. But in taking extreme measures to ensure the core banks will live, the authorities are abandoning the vast non-bank financial sector to its fate. The Fed will try to offset the enormous competitive advantage gained by banks by buying commercial paper from non-bank financial firms such as GE Capital. However, this will not come close to balancing the full benefits of the guarantees for the banks, provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.The non-bank financial sector in the US is already under even more severe stress than its banks. Analysts fear Tuesday’s announcement of sovereign aid for banks could intensify the non-bank collapse, unless more steps are taken to aid the non-banks in the coming days.Contraction of the non-banks could lead to more distressed sales of assets and firms, scrambles for bank licences and an accelerated shift of both assets and liabilities into the sector. The problem is that if the core banks are not only to fill the hole left by their losses and reduce their leverage but also absorb a wave of assets coming into the banking system from the wider financial system, they will need a lot more than their half-share of the $250bn in government capital.The US plan will only suffice if it succeeds in crowding in large amounts of private capital. If not, many multiples of the $250bn may be needed.
671;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-13T09:20:47Z;UK Treasury provides fillip for sterling;;Sterling rallied strongly on Monday, tracking equities higher, on news that the UK Treasury would inject £37bn of capital in three of Britain’s largest banks.The pound advanced 1.5 per cent against the dollar to $1.7368, paring the 8.1 per cent fall it has suffered since September 22. Against the yen, the pound rose 1.2 per cent to Y174.97, while gaining 1.7 per cent against the euro to £0.7782.Paul Meggyesi at JPMorgan said: “The UK system was rightly regarded as among the most vulnerable globally but, ironically, is now one of the least risky due to partial nationalisation and meaningful guarantees for £250bn of bank debt.”The euro initially steadied after eurozone leaders agreed on a region-wide bank rescue plan at an emergency Paris summit on Sunday night.But Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon warned: “As investors come to ponder the cost of the bail-outs and the economic slowdown ahead, the glow surrounding the euro will dissipate.”By the end of the day, the eurozone currency had erased its earlier gains to slide 0.3 per cent against the dollar to $1.3512, and had ticked 0.5 per cent lower against the yen to Y136.21.Policy moves across the globe did help high yield and emerging market currencies to claw back some of last week’s losses. The G7 pledged on Friday to “use all available tools to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure”.The Australian dollar jumped 4.1 per cent against the yen to Y68.59, after the Australian government guaranteed all bank deposits for three years. The Aussie has lost a third of its value since its July peak.The New Zealand dollar was under more pressure amid concerns over the weak New Zealand economy, with government data showing a third monthly fall in house prices.But the Kiwi added 0.3 per cent against the yen to Y61.32, up from an intra-day low of Y59.19.Mexico’s peso regained ground after record lows last week, up 4.9 per cent against the dollar to 12.3140pesos. Last week, Mexico’s central bank sold $8.9bn, almost a tenth of its foreign reserves, to shore up the currency.In Brazil, the real soared 5.9 per cent to R$2.1757 after the central bank auctioned dollar swap contracts for a sixth consecutive session.Mirroring other high-yielding currencies, the South African rand was off its lows, at one point leaping 3.8 per cent to R9.09 before paring its gains to stand 1.7 per cent higher at R9.2390.The South Korean won continued to trim last week’s losses, jumping 5.2 per cent against the dollar to Won1238.40.The country’s biggest steelmaker, Posco, said it had sold $200m since Friday to help shore up the foreign exchange market.
672;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-08T20:53:25Z;US stocks slide despite rate cuts;;Wall Street stocks on Wednesday extended their worst five-day run of losses since 1987 after the co-ordinated global interest rate cut failed to calm nerves during a highly volatile session.Initial euphoria over the move dissolved and the market subsequently swung between gains and losses throughout the day. Further developments underlined concerns that the financial crisis was already hurting US companies by damping global demand and denting their ability to raise funds.Insurance stocks were particularly hard hit after Metlife became the latest big American company to announce plans to raise capital in the midst of the credit freeze. Metlife shed 26.8 per cent at $27, while peers Allstate and XL Capital sank 21.2 per cent at $29.96 and 27.7 per cent at $8.68 respectively.Similarly, Bank of America shed another 7.7 per cent to $21.95 after the group priced 455m shares at $22 each.Meanwhile, Alcoa kicked off the earnings season in downbeat fashion by announcing, after the close of the previous session, a lower-than-expected profit that sent the shares down 12.7 per cent on Wednesday to $14.59. The aluminium group has suspended its share buy-back programme.In volatile trading, the S&P 500 was by up as much as 2.5 per cent and down by the same margin.Stock futures jumped immediately after global central banks announced the cuts. “At last, a co-ordinated show of force,” said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. “The move is to be applauded but there is more to come . ”Yet the S&P closed 1.1 per cent lower at 984.86, further below the psychologically significant level of 1,000 that was breached in the previous session for the first time in five years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 per cent at 9,256.11, having slid by 3.7 per cent in the last half hour of trading. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,740.33.The decline came even after a slew of stocks hit new lows for the year. The overall material sector overcame Alcoa’s difficulties, up 2.6 per cent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and US Steel gained 10.1 per cent at $42.60 and 4.1 per cent at $53.37, respectively.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped another 7.3 per cent to 57.58, the highest level since the credit crisis began.The SEC confirmed that its short ban imposed last month would be lifted last night, as planned. The index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the list fell 2.4 per cent, taking the loss since the ban was introduced to more than a quarter.Some in the market have blamed the ban for exacerbating volatility. “A lot of these liquidity providers [such as hedge funds] have just walked away from these stocks,” said Peter Bottini of optionsXpress.Legg Mason fell 13 per cent on Wednesday to $25.25, after Moody’s cut the debt rating on the money manager. American Express was among the biggest winners earlier in the session after Sanford C. Bernstein initiated coverage on the stock with a “market perform’’ rating and said the credit card group stands to increase market share. It later reversed the gains to stand 4 per cent lower at $27.12.Morgan Stanley – which sank as much as 39.9 per cent in the previous session on speculation that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s planned $9bn investment might not materialise – rose 4.8 per cent to $16.80. Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi reiterated that the deal would go ahead.Bank of New York Mellon climbed 7.9 per cent to $24.45 after agreeing to buy JPMorgan Trust Bank in Japan.Elsewhere, a host of retailers disclosed poor September sales. Escaping the declines, defensive stock Wal-Mart eased 0.5 per cent to $54.55 after the discount retailer was one of the few to report a positive like-for-like performance.Office Depot was one of biggest drags on the S&P, sinking 18.8 per cent to $3.67 after Credit Suisse cut its “neutral” recommendation to “underperform”.In automotives, Ford and General Motors shed 8.9 per cent at $2.66 and 8.6 per cent at $6.91 respectively – even as oil slid – after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the duo from “hold” to “sell”.
673;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-07T19:22:55Z;Rescue plan helps lift Icelandic krona;;"The Icelandic krona rallied on Tuesday following dramatic government moves to shore up the country’s finances.The krona surged 13.6 per cent to IKr110.21 against the dollar, and was up 12.8 per cent at IKr149.98 against the euro.Iceland’s state rescue plan included the nationalisation of the country’s second largest bank, a “peg” to stem the currency’s steep decline and a possible €4bn ($5.4bn) loan from Russia.On Monday the krona at one point plunged more than 48 per cent against the euro and in early trading on Tuesday hit a fresh low of IKr233.48. The government said the peg would freeze the exchange rate at the equivalent of IKr131 against the euro.But with Iceland’s foreign reserves at less than $3bn, analysts doubted the “peg” would work.Lars Christensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank said: “To maintain a credible [foreign exchange] peg the government would have to put forward a credible stabilisation package, and there is still no news of such a package despite the prime minister’s earlier indications.”Elsewhere, Australia’s central bank surprised the market by slashing interest rates by 100 basis points to 6 per cent, double the expected cut, and the largest reduction since the 1992 recession.The Aussie rose 1.3 per cent against its US counterpart to $0.7185, having at one point risen to $0.7355 as it recovered from Monday’s sharp fall.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said: “Far from punishing a currency for its lack of yield, it seems that investors are now
prepared to reward a currency where the central bank is prepared to take robust action to support the economy.”The Australian dollar also trimmed losses against the Japanese yen, gaining
2.2 per cent to Y73.50. On Monday the Aussie sank to four-year lows as investors sold off high-yield currencies for the relative haven of the yen.Other currencies regained ground against the yen on news that the US Federal Reserve would provide funding to the commercial paper market, a liquidity-boosting measure that injected a degree of confidence. The dollar pared an early 2 per cent gain to stand 1.1 per cent higher at Y102.41.Sterling enjoyed a modest rally against the dollar following Monday’s slide, up 0.8 per cent against the US dollar at $1.7580 and flat against the euro at £0.7744.Expectations of a UK rate cut on Thursday had earlier weighed on the pound, but some analysts suggested decisive action from the Bank of England could help calm the market.“The renewed market turmoil has likely shifted the Bank of England’s balance of concerns sooner, and with more force, than even we had anticipated,” said Richard McGuire at RBC Capital Markets."
674;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
675;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-06T22:02:50Z;Icelandic krona sinks as yen soars;;Crisis turned to capitulation in the currency markets on Monday after bail-out fears drove the Icelandic krona to record lows, while turmoil on global equity markets drove investors to the safety of the Japanese yen.The Icelandic krona sank amid fears that the country’s financial affairs were in such a mess that foreign investment would dry up.Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank said: “The financing of the current account deficit depends on the inflow of foreign capital. Therefore, a balance of payment crisis seems inevitable. This means that the fall of the krona will continue.”Trading volumes were about half of those seen over the past couple of months, exacerbating the violent sell-off, which at one point showed the krona at a record low of IKr230.65 against the euro – a fall of more than 48 per cent on the day.At its worst level against the dollar, the krona was down more than 18 per cent at IKr133.25, a record low.Later, the Icelandic currency was down 13 per cent at IKr127.46 against the dollar and off 16 per cent at IKr179.84 versus the euro.The Paris summit at the weekend was supposed to provide markets with the idea that solutions to the financial crisis in Europe would soon be found.But after the dollar hit a fresh peak for the year against the euro on Monday, investors were left wondering whether European leaders can find a way out of the current turmoil.“The minimum requirement for any solution to Europe’s financial crisis is unified leadership,” said Simon Derrick, of Bank of New York Mellon. “At the moment it is not there and investors are running for cover.”The euro fell 2.2 per cent to $1.3474 against the dollar, while sterling fell 1.7 per cent to $1.7410.As investors sought safety, yen crosses took a pounding – the dollar fell 4 per cent to Y101.10, sterling lost 6 per cent to Y174.60 and the euro dropped 5.7 per cent to Y135.28 – moves that breached multi-year records in volatility.Worst hit were the highest yielding currencies, usually at play in the carry trade – a strategy whereby investors trade on interest rate differentials by borrowing in low-yielding currencies such as the yen and investing in higher yielding units.On Monday afternoon in New York, the Australian dollar was undermined by fears that the country’s Reserve Bank would cut interest rates from 7 per cent to 6.5 per cent on Tuesday – its biggest reduction in more than seven years.The Aussie fell 10.4 per cent to Y72.68 against the yen and was down 7.1 per cent to $0.7175 against the dollar.New Zealand’s dollar retreated 7.9 per cent against the yen to Y63.78 and was down 4.6 per cent against its US counterpart at $0.6296.
676;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-06T15:41:37Z;View of the day: Vulnerable euro;;The piecemeal approach by various European governments towards the banking crisis has highlighted a lack of consensus within the EU and leaves the euro increasingly vulnerable, says Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon.“There are two key points to be drawn from this weekend’s events. The first is that there will almost certainly now be a wave of announcements from each of the eurozone members announcing that they will also agree to guarantee the deposits sitting in their nations’ banks,” he says.“A failure to do so will risk massive shifts in funds out of these banks and into those in other countries that are guaranteed. Although the move to provide such guarantees is better than the highly destabilising alternative, this will raise questions about how these guarantees would be funded were they to be called upon.“The second, and potentially even more euro-damaging point is what the events over the weekend reveal about pan-European co-operation in the face of a major financial crisis. It is difficult not to come away with the impression that politicians are simply responding to domestic events rather than having an overriding plan of campaign. In the circumstances it would not be surprising if investors exit the euro and seek the security of a currency where one government is responsible for financial policy. Little wonder the euro had one of its biggest one-day falls on Monday.”

678;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-03T18:59:12Z;Sterling in large fall against dollar;;The pound put in its worst performance against the dollar for 16 years this week as fears grew over the extent of the spill-over from the credit crisis on the UK economy.Sterling dropped 3.8 per cent to $1.7750 against the dollar over the week, its largest drop since October 1992, just after the pound was ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism.The UK government’s bail-out of mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley rattled investors, while a series of gloomy economic data heightened expectations that the economy was headed for recession.Surveys indicated that activity in both the UK manufacturing and service sectors fell to record lows in September, while UK house prices recorded their sharpest one-year drop since 1991.Furthermore, figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage lending virtually ground to a halt in August while UK equity withdrawal turned negative for the first time since 1998.“This suggest not only are UK households unable to withdraw equity, but are in fact repaying debt, confirming the bleak outlook for the consumer,” said Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas. “We expect sterling to remain under pressure.”The data raised expectations that the Bank of England could cut interest rates by as much as 50 basis points to 4.5 per cent after its policy meeting next week, potentially knocking another pillar of support from under the pound.But Simon Derrick at BNY Mellon said it was fears over the banking sector that really hurt the pound.“Unlike in the US, we are only just beginning to get a sense of the full exposure of the UK to the banking crisis,” he said.Mr Derrick said the UK taxpayer was just as exposed, if not more, on a per capita basis to funding a rescue of the financial sector than the US taxpayer.“The Bank of England looks like it is in a position to cut interest rates and is just at the start of its cutting cycle,” he said. “We think the pound could get hit, and hit hard, sending it down below $1.70 against the dollar.”However, the pound rose 2 per cent to £0.7768 against the euro as fears over the eurozone financial sector were stoked by a series of banking bail-out across the region.Paul Robinson at Barclays Capital said the pound could trade up to £0.77 against the single currency, even though economic data in the UK looked terrible.He said the issues facing the eurozone banking system were worse than those faced in the UK.“A lot of the small banks in the UK have been taken over, with the financial system now dominated by four big players,” he said.“What you have in Europe is a large system of small regional banks that look vulnerable to further turmoil.”
679;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-10-01T12:57:56Z;Wall St rallies on hopes of revived bail-out;;US stocks ended their worst month for six years on a positive note on Tuesday, repairing by more than half the damage from the previous session’s historic slump.Equities rebounded from their worst session since Black Monday on hopes that Washington would revive a plan to bail out the banking sector. The rally came even though money markets remained under unprecedented strain – as they have been for the past two weeks – while the latest housing data showed there was little economic respite in sight.Homebuilders, routed in the previous session, recovered slightly. KB Home rose 1.8 per cent to $19.68 while Pulte Homes inched up 0.6 per cent at $13.97.The S&P 500 closed up 5.3 per cent at 1,164.73, albeit in light volume because of a holiday and the end of the quarter. The gain nevertheless left the benchmark down 9.2 per cent during a month in which the American financial sector was drastically reshaped.The Nasdaq Composite Index was 5 per cent higher at 2,082.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent at 10,850.66.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 15.6 per cent on Tuesday, although at 39.45 it continued to indicate extremely elevated levels of distress.Investors expect Congress to pass the $700bn troubled asset relief programme in some form later this week.“The market thinks there’s going to be a solution,” Steve Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investments, said. He added, however: “I wouldn’t read too much into this . . . This is an environment in which information is unavailable. Period.”Regional banking stocks were among the biggest winners from a 13.1 per cent rally in financials. National City, which sank 63.3 per cent on Monday, rose 28.7 per cent to $1.75.Sovereign Bancorp rose 69.5 per cent to $3.95 a share. Fox-Pitt Kelton raised its recommendation on the stock from “in-line” to “outperform”.Regions Financial jumped 16.4 per cent to $9.60. Fifth Third, down 43.6 per cent in the previous session, added 30.6 per cent at $11.90.Custodian banks, normally seen as among the safest banking stocks but which sustained heavy losses in the previous session, also rebounded. State Street added 29.3 per cent to $56.88 and Bank of New York Mellon 23 per cent to $32.58.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 8 per cent, just above the level set when the ban was introduced earlier in the month.Hartford Financial Services was a notable outlier from the rally after Fitch warned that the insurer’s exposure to credit markets could result in ratings downgrades. Down 11.7 per cent in the previous session, it fell another 18 per cent on Tuesday to close at $40.99.Technology stocks, among the worst hit in the previous session’s rout, also made modest gains.Microsoft, whose chief executive Steve Ballmer warned that no company was immune to the global financial crisis, climbed 6.7 per cent at $26.69. Intel rose 8.5 per cent to $18.73 after Piper Jaffray upgraded its recommendation on the semiconductor manufacturer from “neutral” to “buy”.Google, which fell below $400 on Monday for the first time in two years, fell another 10.4 per cent at $341.43 after a last-minute slump. Apple, whose 17.9 per cent sell-off was described by Goldman Sachs as “overdone”, recovered 8 per cent to $113.66.The SEC’s plan to release guidance on fair value accounting, which emerged late in the session, also helped sentiment.“Every little indication that the authorities are willing to compromise and accommodate the market is helpful,” said Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management.Automotive stocks, which suffered declines in the previous session even after Congress voted to fund $25bn of government low-interest loans to help the sector, recovered in spite of oil’s near $5-a-barrel rise. General Motors and Ford rose 11.1 per cent to $9.45, and 24.7 per cent to $5.20, respectively.Among the non-financials to benefit, Dr Pepper Snapple – spun off by Cadbury earlier this year – climbed 9.1 per cent to $26.48. It is to replace Wm Wrigley Jr in the S&P index.

Hong Kong shares dropped as much as 6.1 per cent, the Nikkei in Japan lost 5.0 per cent, and Taiwan, which had been closed on Monday, lost as much as 6.7 per cent. However losses narrowed as the day progressed and Hong Kong, for example, closed with a 0.8 per cent gain. In India, the Sensex was 2.4 per cent higher by mid afternoon in Mumbai at 12,891.82South Korea and Taiwan temporarily banned short selling and Hong Kong’s regulator reminded investors that it would punish aggressive shorting.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index had fallen 3.4 per cent to 107.57 by early evening in Tokyo, extending the drop of 4.9 per cent it made over the previous five days. September looks as thought it will be the regional benchmark’s worst month since for 18 years.“There’s a massive crisis of confidence,” said Khiem Do, head of multi-asset at Baring Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I’m buying today. I love to buy when there’s panic. It’s the time to get companies with good long-term prospects cheaply.” He said the MSCI Asia Pacific index was trading at a bargain valuation of around 10.5 times earnings.Asian investors took their cue from the US markets, where the S&P 500 fell 8.8 per cent, its worst day since falling 20.5 per cent on October 19, 1987. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 7 per cent, close to the 7.3 per cent it fell when markets reopened after the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.Oil fell by more than 10 per cent overnight. Nymex light sweet crude was trading at $96.42 a barrel by late afternoon in Singapore.The yen rose as investors returned money to Japan which they had borrowed there cheaply to deposit in other countries such as Australia with much higher interest rates. It reached Y103.54 to the dollar before weakening by more than one per cent beyond Y104.80.The South Korean won, however, hit Won1,230 to the dollar, its weakest for nearly five and a half years before strengthening slightly to Won1,206.75.Banks fell across the Asia-Pacific region, and so did exporters as investors worried about the prospects for the US economy, their biggest market.Among Japan’s big banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, which on Monday bought a 20 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley, fell as much as 7.0 per cent, although it closed 4.7 per cent lower at Y893. MUFG lost about $500m on the $9bn investment overnight as Wall Street punished financial stocks.Nomura Holdings, Japan’s largest broker, dropped 7.3 per cent to Y1,326 in Tokyo and HSBC, the company with the biggest weighting in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, Sumitomo Mitsui fell by 7.1 per cent to Y630,000 and Sumitomo Trust & Banking dropped 6.6 per cent to Y670.In India, ICICI Bank dropped 7.2 per cent at the open as rumours circulated about the bank’s financial position before quickly changing direction to rise as much as 8.4 per cent to Rs534.50 after the Reserve Bank of India guaranteed the bank’s deposits. ICICI’s managing director, K V Kamath, called the rumours “baseless and malicious”.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the world’s biggest bank by market value, lost as much as 8.7 per cent in Hong Kong but ended the day 1.6 per cent higher at HK$4.58 (ICBC was not traded in Shanghai as mainland markets are closed until Monday for the Golden Week of public holidays.)The region’s biggest market, Japan, fell to its worst closing levels since June 2005. The Nikkei 225 average ended 4.1 per cent lower at 11,259.86 and the broader Topix index ended 3.6 per cent lower at 1,087.41.Among leading electronics companies, Sony fell 7.1 per cent to Y3,150, Canon lost 6.1 per cent to Y3,820 and the games maker Nintendo was down 4.0 per cent to Y43,400.The Hang Seng index closed 0.8 per cent higher at 18,016.21 and the main sub-index of mainland companies listed in the territory was 1.3 per cent higher at 9,070.31The pain was spread across most of the territory’s listed companies. Bank Of East Asia fell by 2.0 per cent to HK$24.00 and China Merchants Bank fell by 2.8 per cent to HK$18.22. But Wing Lung Bank rose by 6.2 per cent to HK$155.10 as China Merchants completed its purchase of Wing Lung.The oil producer Cnooc fell by 1.7 per cent to HK$8.85 but mainland refiners rose as cheaper crude helps them to improve margins as Beijing controls the price of petrol and other refined products. PetroChina rose by 1.0 per cent to HK$8.00 and Sinopec gained 2.4 per cent to HK$6.03.However BYD, the battery maker, rose for the second day running after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett took a 10 per cent stake on Monday. BYD rose by 7.9 per cent to HK$12.84.Australia suffered twice over: financial companies followed their peers around the world, and resource and energy producers were also hit by the fall in the price of crude and declining metals. The S&P/ASX 200 index ended 4.3 per cent lower at 4,600.50, a 21-month closing low.BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner and a big oil producer, fell by 9.5 per cent to A$31.00 and Rio Tinto fell by 11.5 per cent to A$84.50.Fortescue Metals, an iron ore miner, fell by 16.8 per cent to A$4.66 on worries about declining global demand.Among the big banks, National Australia Bank fell by 5.6 per cent to A$24.26 and St George Bank fell by 6.8 per cent to A$28.60.Financial companies that depended on cheap credit to buy infrastructure and other assets also fell sharply.

682;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-26T16:35:57Z;Wary traders return to the yen;;The yen advanced this week as investor risk aversion climbed on news that negotiations to push the Bush administration’s $700bn financial rescue package through US Congress had stalled and against the background of the biggest US bank failure.A hardcore of Republicans in Washington maintained their resistance to the rescue deal while authorities shut down Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loans bank, and sold its assets. The news pushed investors towards the safe haven of the low-yielding yen, which has been used widely by carry trade investors to fund the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets elsewhere.“The combination of the news of the biggest bank failure in US history and the rejection of the bailout plan by hardline Republicans is just about the last thing that anyone needed to hear,” said Neil Mellor, of Bank of New York Mellon.The yen rose 0.8 per cent to Y105.95 against the dollar on the week, climbed 0.1 per cent to Y154.70 against the euro and gained 0.3 per cent to Y195.30 against the pound.Against the higher yielding Australian and New Zealand dollars, the yen’s gains were stronger as it rose 0.9 per cent to Y88.23 and 1.3 per cent to Y72.76, respectively, over the week.The yen’s advance came in spite of figures that showed Japan recorded its first trade deficit for 25 years in August, a sign that the global slowdown was hurting Japan’s export driven economy. Some analysts said this would be a long-term negative for the yen, which historically has been closely correlated with Japan’s trade position, and harm its status as a safe-haven currency.But Derek Halpenny, of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said there was a compelling argument to suggest that a deterioration in Japan’s trade balance would not weigh on the yen as it had in the past. He said the composition of Japan’s overall current account balance had been changing, with the country’s investment income surplus now far outweighing its trade balance – a feature that has been in place since early 2005.“So now, cyclical changes in trade will have far less impact on Japan’s overall current account position,” said Mr Halpenny. “We would advise avoiding the conclusion that the yen will weaken due to the deteriorating trade balance – market dynamics are much different today.”The low-yielding Swiss franc, which also acts as a safe haven in times of market turmoil, also gained. It rose 1.4 per cent to SFr1.0860 against the dollar on the week, climbed 0.7 per cent to SFr1.5886 against the euro and gained 0.9 per cent to SFr2.0020 against the pound.Meanwhile, the dollar stayed on the back foot as the political wrangling in Washington continued. But its losses were limited amid signs that the effects of the credit crisis were spreading across the globe. Forecasts that the eurozone was headed towards recession were reinforced as business confidence dropped across the region. Over the week, the dollar fell 0.6 per cent to $1.4615 against the euro and lost 0.4 per cent to $1.8424 against the pound.Elsewhere, the South African rand came under pressure, falling 2.1 per cent to R8.0730 against the dollar over the week as the resignation of a third of the country’s cabinet following the ousting of Thabo Mbeki as president raised fears over the political situation in the country.
683;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-24T20:52:23Z;Lehman collapse puts prime broker model in question;;For the past year some of the smartest people in the hedge fund industry have been worrying about the safety of their prime brokers, the lucrative arms of investment banks which service hedge funds.This month the dangers shot into the open, as the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to concerns about the survival of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the investment banks which run the world’s two biggest prime brokers. Among hedge funds this caused widespread panic. Funds that used Lehman – including GLG Partners, Amber Capital and Ramius – have found they cannot access a total of $40bn of assets held at the European arm of the bank.Those that did not use Lehman raced to shift money out of Morgan and Goldman into the prime brokerages of commercial banks regarded as safer, including JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital and UBS. A handful of jittery hedge funds cut their borrowing and moved assets to custodians such as Bank of New York Mellon and State Street, who guard trillions of dollars for mutual fund managers and institutions.In the process hedge funds caused wild swings in shares such as Volkswagen, buying back stocks they had been betting against and trying to hedge positions stuck at Lehman. “Every minute that these assets are frozen and we are unable to trade on them is a minute of significant potential harm to our investors,” Amber Capital said. “We are caught in the vortex here.”Many hedge funds are still buried in the rubble of Lehman, but others are pondering their future banking relationships. Their concerns go to the heart of the prime brokerage business model, which is built on a practice known as rehypothecation. A proportion of assets used to back loans can usually be “rehypothecated” into the prime broker’s name, so the broker can use them to raise cash.This cash is then used to fund lending to funds for leveraged purchases, and to support the borrowing of stock the prime broker can lend to funds wanting to go short.The dangers for hedge funds of having their assets rehypothecated became painfully clear last week: $22bn of the $40bn held by Lehman’s European prime brokerage had been rehypothecated.Hedge funds trying to reclaim the rehypothecated assets have found themselves in the queue of general creditors, likely to get back only a proportion of their money.Even those hedge funds which had insisted they did not want their assets rehypothecated – such as Amber and a small RAB Capital fund – face a long and potentially painful wait to get back securities held in segregated client accounts. PwC, administrators of Lehman’s London business, have told hedge funds it is likely to take months to calculate how much is due to whom, and to offset this against debts.But it is rehypothecation which poses the biggest threat to hedge funds, and could lead to the biggest changes in the prime brokerage industry.The main prime brokers were almost completely self-funding, according to current and former executives, needing very little access to the balance sheet of their parent bank, thanks to hedge fund cash kept on deposit and the rehypothecation of assets.Most of the cash has already gone, hedge fund managers say, shifted away from prime brokerages to banks regarded as saferTake away rehypothecation, and banks will have to borrow at far more expensive rates in order to lend to hedge funds, pushing down their profitability and pushing up the cost of borrowing.“Corrective action needed to take place because a rush of prime brokers into the market had caused aggressive margin pricing,” said Nick Roe, head of prime finance at Citigroup. “Some hedge funds were getting extraordinarily cheap money.“If hedge funds now say you cannot rehypothecate, the cost of finance may be more expensive than hedge funds are willing to pay.”Exactly how much more is hard to calculate, but brokers estimate the cost of internal financing across City and Wall Street banks is now 1.5-3 percentage points over Libor, against about 0.6 points for rehypothecated assets.Some bankers argue that the prohibitive cost will make hedge funds stick with prime brokers and rehypothecation. Others, though, argue that big changes are on the way.“What we have now is a great opportunity to reduce the structural and systemic risks from counterparties in hedge fund investing,” said Rick Sopher, who oversees investments in hedge funds at LCF Rothschild Group.For some of the biggest institutional investors in hedge funds, the small risk of a bank collapse taking out a series of funds is seen as much more dangerous than accepting lower returns.Many of the biggest funds agree. Citadel, the $20bn Chicago hedge fund, has gone the furthest to protect itself from problems with prime brokers, raising debt from the private bond market. But others have taken term loans from big banks such as HSBC, or set up daily “sweeps” to remove from their prime brokers any assets not being used as collateral.For the highly profitable prime brokers, this loss of assets would be terrible news if extended across the industry, pushing up their funding costs and hurting what for many banks was the most profitable division in recent years.Ideas being bandied about by hedge funds could be even worse news. Some big managers and prime brokers are considering whether assets could be kept secure at custodians, with the broker given a charge over those it lends against – making the assets safe from a bank collapse by blocking rehypothecation altogether.Others wonder whether prime brokers could set up a segregated custody division, something which appeals to managers who doubt the capability of established custodians, but trust their prime brokers to run reliable systems.Even if there is no dramatic change to the business model, prime brokers face a less profitable future and hedge funds will have to pay more for less generous leverage. If investors get their way, that cost will be even higher – but at least there will be less chance of funds being destroyed by a catastrophic bank collapse.
684;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Scheme hopes to shield retail investors;;"The US government’s plan to help underwrite the massive $3,400bn (€2,360bn, £1,850bn) held in money market funds is part of an attempt to stop the ballooning financial crisis from spreading to retail investors.Money market funds, which have grown hugely in the past two years as investors sought a safe haven from equity market and fixed income turmoil, are facing their biggest crisis following news that one fund this week “broke the buck”, or gave back investors less than they put in.It was the first clear sign that the Wall Street crisis could affect retail investors, which hold about a third, or more than $1,000bn, of money market funds.Investors have begun to pull their money from the money funds – right at a time when some funds hit a fresh crisis owing to their exposure to short-term debt in Lehman Brothers and other troubled financial firms.More than $90bn was pulled from money market funds in just one day on Wednesday, the day after the news that the Reserve Primary fund had “broken the buck” and would give back investors just 97 cents in the dollar. It was the first time in 14 years a fund had fallen below its par level.The money fund operators – which include the biggest fund management firms in the US – are braced for more redemptions and for the need to bail out their funds or risk a run.Legg Mason, which has already spent more than $2bn in loans and guarantees to prop up its money market funds, on Friday said it would spend a further $630m to ensure investors in its funds did not lose money.Money market funds have already been struggling for a year under a near-lethal combination of paralysed fixed income markets, which made it difficult for them to trade their securities; exposure – albeit small – to near-worthless commercial paper; and falling interest rates, which made for razor-thin margins.Many would have “broken the buck” in the past year if they had not been bailed out by their parent companies, which did so to guard against the reputational damage arising from allowing a money market investor to lose money.A total of 21 fund companies have outlaid more than $8bn in loans, guarantees and liquidity injections to prop up their funds and ensure investors got their $1-a-share investments back. Many more money funds are operated by privately held firms which could have had such bail-outs without disclosing them.On Wednesday, Putnam announced it would close a large money market fund because of heavy redemptions. The fund held no subpar securities, but it had to sell securities to meet the redemptions, and this was too difficult to do in an illiquid market, Putnam said.Bank of New York Mellon’s Institutional Cash Reserves fund, which is similar to a money market fund, also fell below $1 a share, the group said on Thursday.For the next year, the Treasury will insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund – both retail and institutional – that pays a fee to participate in the programme.Regulators have had serious concerns about money market funds this year because they are viewed as being as safe as bank accounts – but not guaranteed by the government, as bank accounts are.The efforts that the parent companies went to in propping up their funds was an indication of how seriously they took the funds’ reputational safety.Investors have maintained heavy cash stashes as equity and fixed income markets faltered. Many also hold significant amounts of cash in brokerage accounts, which in recent years have offered linked chequeing accounts. These accounts are likewise not covered by government guarantees."
685;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-18T20:47:46Z;US stocks surge in late trade;;The prospect of the creation of a Resolution Trust Corporation-style plan to deal with the turmoil in financial markets led stocks to their biggest rally in nearly six years late in the session.A violent swing in financials reversed the rout of the previous day as investors responded positively to the prospect of a Treasury plan similar to that which helped bring an end to the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s.Earlier in the session, the market fell as much as 2 per cent, as concerns lingered over the short-term funding of financial institutions even after a liquidity boost from central banks.Yet stocks later rebounded on the possibility that US authorities might follow their British counterparts by banning the short-selling of financial stocks. A second wave of buying came towards the end of the day.Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the move could help liquidity, without which several “firms are dead in the water”. He added “shorts would be really hung out to dry” ahead of quadruple witching tomorrow, the day on which contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures expire.Wild fluctuations in Cit Group illustrated that of the wider market. At one point down 36.1 per cent, the stock closed up 49.7 per cent at $10.70.It emerged that Morgan Stanley was in preliminary merger talks with Wachovia, the troubled regional lender, which soared 59 per cent to $14.50. Yet some analysts questioned the logic of such a deal.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two independent US investment banks still standing, remained in focus.They rose 3.7 per cent at $22.55 and fell 5.7 per cent at $108.00, respectively, as bid talk surrounded the former.In the previous session, they lost 24.2 per cent and 13.9 per cent, respectively, as the cost to insure against default of their debt rose.HSBC, China’s Citic Group and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp were among names that various reports said were also interested in acquiring some or all of Morgan Stanley.Washington Mutual was among the biggest gainers, up 48.8 per cent to $2.99, amid reports that the fourth largest US bank was looking to be sold. The previous day WaMu said it would prop up its money market funds to prevent losses on a Lehman Brothers-issued debt.By the close, markets had rebounded. The S&P 500 was up 4.3 per cent at 1,206.51 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 3.9 per cent at 11,019.69. The Nasdaq Composite rose 4.8 per cent at 2199.10.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 8 per cent to 33.10 after rising as much as 16.4 per cent.General Electric rebounded to 7.4 per cent at $24.79 paring its loss for the week to 7.3 per cent. That came even after Deutsche Bank cut its target price on the world’s third largest company, whose financial arm accounts for about half its business, from $33 to $28.It said: “While it may be easy to attack speculators and short-sellers for these movements, the reality is that unless CDS [credit default swap] spreads quickly normalise, then the cost of financing GE capital . . . could rise sharply.”Custodian banks, which garner revenue from lending stock on behalf of their clients to cover short trades, suffered in the wake of SEC regulations. The new rules are designed to crack down on so-called “naked” short-sellers who do not even borrow shares before selling them.In spite of the positive momentum, State Street endured one of the biggest declines on the S&P 500, down 8.9 per cent to $59. Northern Trust and Bank of New York Mellon fell 6.7 per cent and4.6 per cent, respectively.In the previous session, the market once again slumped amid what has emerged as one of the most extraordinary series of developments in financial history.“How many more disasters and how much more bad news can the world’s economy take in a week?” asked David Buik of BGC Partners.Tobias Levkovich, equity strategist at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients: “Investors are stunned and seem resigned to further losses . . . Fear seems to be overtaking any rational discourse with the credit crunch slipping into crisis proportions.”.
686;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-16T18:27:19Z;US consumer prices fall in August;;US consumer prices fell last month for the first time in nearly two years as oil prices dropped sharply from record highs in a sign that inflation may have peaked, data from the Department of Labor indicated.The consumer price index fell last month by 0.1 per cent after rising 0.8 per cent in July on a monthly basis, in line with economists’ forecasts, the first drop since October 2006.“There’s no question in my mind that the inflation scare of the last few years is now behind us and inflation is set to modify in a very significant way,” said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia.The report comes after data last week showed a sharp drop in producer prices and the cost of imports, led by falling energy costs, and is a boost for the US economy as it navigates the deepening financial turmoil.It also provides increased leeway for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – which could help to reduce defaults on home loans and foreclosures, and ease strains in the financial system.“The latest CPI and producer price index data should give the Fed some much-needed breathing room,” said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon.However, while oil prices – which hit a record $147 a barrel in mid-July and has since fallen below $100 – will reduce the pain felt by consumers at the petrol pump, the drop is spurred by a slowing global economy that is reducing demand.Energy prices slipped back by 3.1 per cent in August after three months of sharp rises, the CPI showed, and petrol prices fell by 4.2 per cent. On Monday, oil prices hit a seven-month low.Nevertheless, rising prices still remain a concern for the Fed, with the CPI indicating that year-on-year inflation in August rose by a sharp 5.4 per cent, only slightly less than the 5.6 per cent rate in the previous month that was the highest since the 1991 Gulf War.Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.2 per cent, less than the 0.3 per cent increase in July but still close to recent trends. Year-on-year inflation was 2.5 per cent, the same as in the previous month and above the Fed’s preferred 2 per cent upper boundary. Economists expect a decline in core inflation to lag the headline figure by a few months as businesses seek to make up for facing squeezed margins while prices were rising fast.Good news on the inflation front was added to by hopeful signs in the housing market as an index of homebuilders’ confidence increased in September for the first time since February, rising two points to a level of 18 from its all-time low in the previous two months.Builders felt more hopeful after the introduction of a first time buyer tax credit and after the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the US government promised to keep mortgage rates lower, the report from the National Association of Homebuilders said.
687;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-16T09:07:07Z;Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy;;Lehman Brothers Holdings on Sunday filed for bankruptcy protection as it emerged that Japanese banks were the US group’s top unsecured lenders and authorities in Tokyo have ordered Lehman’s Japanese subsidiary to retain assets in the country.The collapse of the 158-year-old Wall Street institution will cause thousands of job losses among the investment bank’s 25,000-strong staff.The petition for bankruptcy protection does not include Lehman’s broker-dealer operations and other divisions, including Neuberger Berman, the asset manager.This signals that the bank is either in talks to find buyers for the operations or is planning to unwind the businesses gradually.The Chapter 11 filing reveals that Japan’s Aozora is owed $463m in unsecured bank loans, more so than any other banks, while Mizuho is in second place with $289m owed.Aozora is controlled by the US private equity group Cerberus. In August, it had to revise its profit downward to take into account a loss from its investment in GMAC, the US financial services group.The Financial Services Agency in Japan issued the order to Lehman on Monday. A spokesman told Bloomberg: “We are in contact and co-operation with overseas regulators including those in the US …We are currently gathering information and working to understand the situation.”Citibank and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation are listed as the largest unsecured bondholders because of their roles as trustees for certain Lehman bond offerings, with a combined exposure of around $138bn.The Bank of New York Mellon issued a statement on Tuesday clarifying that it has no outstanding loans to Lehman and in its role as trustee, the bank merely facilitates the payment of interest and principal.PricewaterhouseCoopers has begun the process of winding down Lehman’s European units on Monday morning.The London Financial Services Authority said in a statement: “Lehman Brothers is a US institution regulated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission], so the FSA is working closely with the US authorities to ensure an orderly wind down of its principal UK trading subsidiary, Lehman Brothers International (Europe), which was placed into administration earlier this morning.”“The FSA is working with market practitioners, including the London Clearing House, to ensure the process connected with the winding down of this wholesale business is completed in an orderly manner to minimise any market disruption.”Germany’s regulator BaFin imposed a so-called moratorium on Lehman’s unit in the country, an order aimed at preserving its remaining assets.
688;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-15T20:59:05Z;The repo sector ‘scramble’;;Banks were scrambling for cash on Monday in the repurchase, or repo, market as they sought to fund their assets and the Federal Reserve loosened restrictions on the types of securities that could be used in its liquidity programmes.The level of borrowing rates was highly volatile in the repo market and there was a strong preference for holding Treasury debt, rather than other securities, given its safe-haven status.Scott Skyrm, senior vice-president at Newedge, a repo broker, said early trading was marked by “a scramble for cash in order to fund portfolios of agencies, mortgages and corporates”.The demand for Treasuries curtailed the lending of them in the repo market, which hampered trading activity, dealers said.The demand for cash and reluctance among banks to lend to each other pushed the effective Fed funds rate to a range of between 6-8 per cent.That ultimately sparked a massive injection of liquidity from the Fed. The Fed injected a further $50bn after an initial $20bn failed to stop the funds rate from rising. It was the largest provision of funds since September 2001.By early afternoon in New York, the effective funds rate was at 3 per cent, still above the target rate of 2 per cent. Traders expect a normalisation in rates as banks offload excess funds during the afternoon.Ánalysts at Wrightson ICAP said the Fed’s operation should “be enough to force the funds rate to zero by the close” once liquidity had filtered through the system.The Fed also sought to bolster the tri-party repo market in which banks borrow funds for short periods of time via either Bank of New York Mellon or JPMorgan, which act as custodian banks for repo investors.Lehman Brothers and other institutions rely heavily on the repo market to fund their operations. They borrow cash from investors and post collateral that includes securities backed by commercial and residential mortgages.A senior repo dealer said: “While it is early days, all indications are that investors using the tri-party market are hanging in and Lehman is going through an orderly wind down.”The Fed helped matters by broadening the types of collateral that dealers can post for cash loans through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and its Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) so that they closely matched the collateral accepted in the tri-party repo market.Tim Backshall, strategist at CDR, said: “This is a positive step, [adding] tri-party repo collateral to calm markets, but should not be seen as anything other than another band-aid. Our banking system cannot be fixed until we all face up to the real losses from the housing market, and these facilities buy time for that process to work out but do not solve the valuation differences.”The loosening in collateral for the PDCF came after 10 dealers said they would form a $70bn stabilisation fund and provide collateralised borrowing for members for up to one-third of the facility for any one bank.“Various institutions and policymakers are attempting to shore up the remaining levees,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “There is a rush for safety.”The Fed meets on Tuesday and interest rate futures were pricing in a strong chance of cut in the funds rate to 1.75 per cent. Some analysts, warned, however, that the Fed may hold rates at 2 per cent. “It appears the Fed is focusing on its liquidity programmes rather than looking to cut rates,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.
689;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-15T11:26:47Z;Lehman’s outstanding debts total $600bn;;Lehman Brothers Holdings owes more than $600bn to creditors scattered across the US, Europe and Asia, according to the investment bank’s Chapter 11 petition.The largest unsecured creditors include Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon, who have around $138bn of exposure to Lehman’s bond debt as indenture trustees.Indenture trustees act as agents on behalf of bondholders, and while they help enforce the rights of creditors, they are not necessarily creditors themselves.Bank of New York Mellon has an additional $17bn in exposure to both subordinated and junior subordinated debt, again as an indenture trustee.Apart from the trustees, Japan’s Aozora Bank, which is part owned by Cerberus, is owed $463m.But Aozora said its actual exposure to Lehman would be ”significantly lower” due to collateral and hedging, Reuters reported.”Whatever may appear in a filing by Lehman in terms of gross exposure will be very different from what we have net of our hedges and net of our collateral,” Richard Layton, Aozora’s chief financial officer, told Reuters in a telephone interview on Monday.Other Japanese banks cited in the filing include Mizuho Corporate Bank, with a $382m exposure in the form of a bank loan, Shinsei Bank with $231m and UFJ Bank with $185m. Japanese markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.The top European creditor is BNP Paribas, which according to the filing extended a $250m bank loan to the investment bank. Shares in the French bank fell 7.2 per cent to €59.88 in midday trade in Paris.Other European banks named in the filing include Svenska Handelsbanken, KBC, Lloyds TSB, Standard Chartered and DnB.
690;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-08T21:37:39Z;Dollar surges to highest level for a year;;The dollar recovered strongly from early sharp losses yesterday, hitting a one-year high against a basket of currencies.The violent price swing came as investors digested news that the US government had bailed out mortgage guarantors Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.The dollar sold off to a low of $1.4428 against the euro and $1.7975 against the pound in Asia trade as worries about US public finances weighed on the greenback.But the dollar staged a dramatic turnround as European markets opened.Analysts said the rescue plan did little to change the backdrop for the dollar’s recent surge higher, with economies outside the US still expected to slow markedly and oil prices to head lower.Simon Derrick of Bank of New York Mellon said that given the pre-emptive action of the US authorities, the outlook for the US economy was arguably more positive than for other regions.With the pace of the sell-off in the euro and the pound against the dollar, he said, many investors were waiting for a bounce in those currencies to cut long positions against the dollar.“This has given them a chance to buy the dollar at better levels,” said Mr Derrick. “The underlying trend towards dollar strength remains in place.”Late in New York, the dollar had recouped its losses to stand up 1.4 per cent at $1.4137 against the euro, up 1.1 per cent at $1.7570 against the pound and 0.9 per cent higher at $1.1300 against the Swiss franc.The dollar index, which tracks its value against a basket of six leading currencies, rose to 79.84, its strongest level since September 2007. Meanwhile, the dollar rose 0.3 per cent to $108.06 against the yen as risky assets rallied.The yen soared late last week as carry trade investors liquidated bets on riskier, higher-yielding assets funded by selling the low-yielding Japanese currency. This move went into reverse yesterday, sending the yen lower across the board.Lee Hardman, of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, said that while the US government’s plan was likely to lead to a near-term bounce in risky assets, the initial wave of optimism would fade as concerns over slowing global growth increased expectations of monetary easing in the leading economies through 2009.“Any near-term yen weakness should be treated as an opportunity to buy it at more attractive levels,” he said.The yen lost 2 per cent to Y152.80 against the euro and dropped 1.8 per cent to Y189.87 against the pound.But rising risk appetite boosted other Asian currencies, which were hit hard last week amid talk of investors pulling funds out of the region. The South Korean won posted its biggest daily increase in a decade, jumping 3.3 per cent against the dollar to Won1,080.30.

They’re very good at it.”In an industry where acknowledgement that competitors exist can sometimes be hard to come by, a back-handed compliment such as this is better than none.The commentator’s counterparts at BNY Mellon will argue, though, that there is more to their offering than the most attractive pricing in the market.Last year’s combination of the two already large players not only created the world’s largest asset services provider in terms of assets under custody, but also one of the world’s largest asset managers, says Tim Keaney, BNY Mellon’s New York-based co-chief executive.Far from being distracted from current and future business considerations by the integration challenge, the enlarged entity has struck a delicate balance, enabling it to build its business while forging ahead with the integration, says Mr Keaney.“Despite what some competitors might think and say, we have not taken our eye off the ball and we are blessed with outsize new business statistics,” he says.“We are winning more than 60 per cent of the new business we are pitching for, which is more than the legacy businesses combined used to achieve.“Assets under custody are up 20-30 per cent, and our revenues are higher and are growing substantially.”The second quarter 2008 earnings summary shows asset servicing fees increased 24 per cent, reflecting increased securities lending revenue, net new business, cross selling and organic growth and the acquisition in fourth quarter 2007 of the remaining 50 per cent interest in Mellon Financial’s securities services joint venture with ABN Amro.“We are seeing a trend for investors to reallocate assets from certain asset classes to cash, 130/30 funds, private equity, venture capital and commodities,” continues Mr Keaney.“We have a range of services to meet their fund administration needs. We process more than 60,000 OTC derivatives transactions a month, a market-leading figure which has almost doubled in the last two years. We have launched the first actively traded exchange traded fund with BNY Mellon Asset Servicing acting as fund administrator.”A dedicated integration team was in place from day one, allowing work to start immediately on what was envisaged as a three-year project, recalls Jim Palermo, Mr Keaney’s fellow co-chief executive, based in Boston. “Our goal is to have more than 80 per cent of client activity on the targeted platform by the end of 2009,” says Mr Palermo. “We have progressed more than halfway to that goal in slightly over one year, and we have every expectation that we will meet that target.”Another goal is to retain 98 per cent-plus of clients through the transition period. Some would say this would be an extraordinary statistic to be able to post. Others would grudgingly admit the same, then add the rejoinder that it is only to be expected, given that the low fees on offer will not be matched elsewhere.Whatever the view, the co-chief executives say the target figure is being beaten, with retention levels currently running at more than 99 per cent. “This is because these are two excellent asset servicing franchises offering the best of both worlds,” says Mr Keaney. “This is not about cutting costs and cutting staff; this is about managing growth.”Both men enthuse not just about the financial numbers being recorded, and the measurable technical progress being achieved to date. They also positively bubble when talking about how staff have adapted to their new existence. “We are seeing a substantially lower turnover of personnel, because staff are excited,” says Mr Keaney. “They see they have a long-term future and career prospects here.”“If anything, the challenge is to recruit enough new staff, to join the existing 44,000-strong global workforce, to service the new business being won,” adds Mr Palermo. “For all that, we invest $600m annually in technology, we never forget this is essentially a people business.”A key to future development is ensuring that the right jobs are located in the right place, in line with regulatory preferences in different jurisdictions. With this in mind, the two men identify three particular growth centres around the world: Pittsburgh in the US, Manchester for the UK and Europe, and Pune in India, covering the Asia-Pacific region. In Pune, BNY Mellon has its own direct presence, with more than 1,000 staff. “We expect that number to continue to grow,” says Mr Palermo. “There is a great pool of talent in and around Pune.”Neither of the two co-chief executives is complacent, though, despite the progress made so far. “We are proud of our accomplishments in the early days, but although we are on, or well ahead of schedule in the integration process, we are not doing a victory lap yet,” concludes Mr Keaney. “There is still some way to go until the job is done.”"
692;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-07T19:24:41Z;IT solutions go best with people interaction;;"The received wisdom in the investment industry seems to be that the increasing penetration of technology throughout asset managers and their service providers automatically translates to a disintermediation of the human element. This, say custodians, is not necessarily the case. Rather, according to Michael Walsh, SVP investor services, UKMEA, at State Street, it is a means of enabling more meaningful conversations with clients as markets and products become more complex.“Going back five years, every UK pension scheme was equities oriented, now they’ve moved into bonds and derivatives,” he says. “To deal with that complexity you have to have the IT to support it, otherwise you do have to throw bodies at it, and you won’t have the dialogue with the customer.”Asset managers’ preoccupations are not generally with the minutiae of processing but with expansion into new products and markets. “We have to have people they can talk to about that,” Mr Walsh says.“If you’re buried in the detail of processing things with bodies, and manual processes, you’re not going to have a very interesting conversation or add value to that customer’s real challenge, which is to grow their business in a complex world.“You have to have knowledgeable people allied to technology. One or the other is not good enough. Technology enables you to have the time to discuss with the customers, move them beyond the scale challenge to how are they going to service their customers.”This is particularly valid as service providers move up the value chain, away from simply providing back office functions towards the middle and front office. The trend towards outsourcing functions and systems to custodians continues, as managers facing more complex mandates and increased regulatory scrutiny demand more frequent risk reporting, analytics and compliance tools.“When you get to the front end, that’s where you’ve got to have people who are able to talk about investment strategies and be knowledgeable about risk and reporting; technology only gets you so far,” Mr Walsh says. “At the back end there’s a certain amount of human touch and interaction, but the further you go up the middle office and front office, the more and more people come into play. But IT is the ticket to the game, because if you can’t give the analysis, you can’t have the discussion.”And that discussion needs to be ongoing, according to Dan Wywoda, head of core product management at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing. The potential is there for a technology dependent service to slide into a low or no-touch relationship between service provider and client. The “touch” has to be engineered into the process, and is beneficial for both parties.BNY Mellon offers an information delivery tool to its clients, and regularly updates and upgrades it. However, Mr Wywoda says, clients often struggled to keep up with the changes to the tool. To remedy this, the company created a “health check” team, whose role would be to enter into a continued dialogue with the client, to educate them about the tool’s uses and to get feedback to help develop it
further.“It ended up paying huge dividends for us in getting the clients to use some of the functionality, to recognise that we’re continuing to invest in that space, that they can leverage it, and that it’s their challenge to give us some ideas for the next generation of improvements,” Mr Wywoda says. “It could be no touch, where we just give them that information delivery tool. But we’ve found that we’ve had to modify our operating model to have people that are healthcare specialists to create that high touch.”Increasingly, asset owners and managers need to fall back on their custodian’s information platforms as they come under ever more scrutiny from auditors, risk officers and accounting boards. “Sometimes there is a hesitancy for a client to use, say, our online tool,” Mr Wywoda says. “And one of the functions we highlight to them is that if they use our tool, they’ll be able to demonstrate to their auditors or their compliance people or their risk people all the controls that go with their instruction.”Clients are slowly being convinced that the ability to leverage a custodian’s technology to provide audit trails and demonstrate controls, rather than making annual trips to the filing cabinet, is worthwhile. “It’s kind of changed the mentality of the client to say, that on top of getting out the fax business, they can use it to demonstrate their own competencies as an organisation, whether it be a pension scheme or a charity or an insurance company,” Mr Wywoda says.A further challenge, which is probably bigger than the rest, according to Simon Walker, deputy head of global custody product management at BNP Paribas Security Services, is making all of the systems appear seamless to the client. “You might have five [systems], you’ve probably got 50, but it’s the challenge to create the sense that it’s one product providing the data,” he says. “The cliché of the business is that it’s delivery of information, and I think that’s where the balance has to come . . . I think even if you had the best front end system, it’s not as though the client is just a computer, the client’s got people in their office and they want to speak to people.”"
693;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-09-07T19:23:46Z;The sector stays aloft in a risky climate;;"If there is one phrase that recurs time and again in discussing the asset services world and comparing it with a year ago, it is “a flight to quality”. It is a form of words more usually associated with the investment management side of the equation, but has become ever more important over the past 12 months to those servicing that industry as the fallout from the credit crisis has continued to spread.“The credit and liquidity crunch that we have all faced have made counterparty risk more important in recent months,” says Jay Hooley, president and chief operating officer at State Street in Boston. “There has been a flight to quality as investment managers and hedge funds look to the safety and soundness of their counterparties. We have seen increased demand from hedge funds to act as custodian for their assets, as concerns grow about their prime brokers.”Jacques-Philippe Marson, president and chief executive officer at BNP Paribas Securities Services in Paris, says his bank’s AA+ credit rating is a key criterion in attracting new business.The safety and soundness elements go beyond the creditworthiness of a counterparty. There has also been a flight to quality from an operational point of view, adds Tim Keaney, co-chief executive at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing: “The past 12 months have spawned a number of interesting challenges for us that have raised the bar for our industry,” he says. “We all face new and more complex demands from clients, and operational excellence has become a prime requirement for new mandates alongside flexibility and price.”Liquidity, too, is a major factor, where counterparties are concerned, making the availability of credit a major issue in the industry.“We are being approached by clients who are having difficult conversations with some of their existing providers of liquidity,” says Satvinder Singh, head of Citi’s direct custody and clearing business in Europe, Middle East and Africa.The renewed focus on risk and risk management is highlighted, and welcomed, by Philippe Carrel, the
Geneva-based executive vice-president in charge of business development for Thomson Reuters. “Risk is being reviewed from scratch,” he says. Value at risk, which had a faithful following for a decade or so in financial services as a way of identifying and measuring risk, and allocating capital to that risk, “has had its day in the sun and is now obsolete”, Mr Carrel declares.He says people are leaving their ivory towers, accepting that things have changed, and that the answers to life, the universe and everything do not lie in obscure economic models.Risk management needs to become an everyday task, rather than an extension of the audit function. The new environment has brought into the limelight a method he tentatively describes as valuation risk, a common sense and pro-active approach to measuring market risk and credit risk together.“Market risk and credit risk are very closely linked,” says Mr Carrel. “The way the market has evolved, your market risk becomes my credit risk, and this has funding implications. A single miscalculation can affect confidence, sending funding costs through the roof.”There is more, of course, to asset services than just numbers and systems, although the numbers are large, the systems increasingly sophisticated, and inter-operability between multilateral trading facilities, central counterparties, custodians and central securities depositories also high on the list of priorities.People still matter in an industry where there remains a strong emphasis on “high-touch” contact with clients. “People and talent underpin everything in this industry,” says Citi’s Mr Singh. “We need to attract, retain and nurture it.”A looming lack of talent in the traditional centres does not bode well, he says, and could lead to an increase in the outsourcing and offshoring by asset servicers of certain functions in the processing chain.Part of Citi’s own solution to the talent problem has been to open for business in Belfast – a move that has been much more successful than it had expected.The likelihood of a renewed wave of consolidation – as smaller players decide to exit asset servicing rather than invest in the technology they will need – is another key
theme that industry participants expect to see develop further.“We are prepared for more opportunities to make acquisitions or forge partnerships to fuel growth in the US and elsewhere,” says Jim Palermo, co-chief executive at BNY Mellon, which is still in the throes of its post-merger integration.“As an asset servicer you establish very close relationships with clients, often talking to them several times a day.Clients want to maintain those kinds of intensive relationships, but that commitment requires significant resources,” says Mr Palermo.“A catalyst of change could be the current economic downturn. We don’t know how long it will last, but if you can’t weather it, you are unlikely to maintain a market presence.” he says.“So over the next six to 18 months we expect some providers to exit and those franchises to become available.”In Asia, market liberalisation, the growth of the mutual fund industry, and the greying population all augur well for the custody and fund administration business over the next few decades, says Neil Daswani, global head securities services at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.“A number of international asset management companies and insurance majors are entering the Asian arena,” says Mr Daswani. “These new entrants do not want to invest in large armies of people and are prepared to outsource non-core functions such as custody, fund administration and transfer agency.”The future does look bright, then, at least for some, and the final word, for now, goes to Tim Howell, global head of HSBC Securities Services, pondering the reckoning that many expect to see.“Asset services has developed very much along the lines I predicted a year ago, in this very spot, albeit much more rapidly than anyone could have expected at that time,” he says.“Today we have a much more grown-up business, in which people are playing more to their individual strengths than has been the case in the past.“Our industry is not only very profitable but also has much more growth left in it. People cannot afford, though, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars only to find they’re a loser three years later.”"
694;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-08-31T20:05:19Z;From inner city to corporate towers;;When the next US bank moves to Canary Wharf, from where will it recruit the IT professionals to run its operations? Not from the commuter belt, says Howard Dawber, but from the populations of inner city boroughs such as Tower Hamlets with which, for the past 20 years, Canary Wharf has co-existed as a neighbour, but rarely called upon as an employer.However, locals will need encouragement says Mr Dawber, a strategic adviser at the property developer Canary Wharf Group. “Local students are academically outperforming their parents. But what they don’t have are adults to open doors for them because none of their relatives has business experience.”To break down the barriers that prevent inner city teenagers from even thinking of applying for jobs in the corporate towers that surround them, a group of businesses, led by Citigroup, started the UK Career Academy Foundation in Canary Wharf in 2002.The charity is now expanding nationally into centres such as Leeds and Manchester, where employers seeking to hire from inner city populations face challenges every bit as daunting as those in London’s Docklands.Based on a US prototype designed to bring young people from nearby Brooklyn on to Wall Street, career academies offer post 16-year-olds who are studying industry-related courses in local schools and colleges an inside track to corporate life. At present established in 100 schools and colleges, with the support of 500 employers, the UK foundation plans to add another 110 educational establishments by 2012.What makes the experience special, says Cameron Holloway, an academy graduate now working at Nationwide’s head office in Swindon,is the personal investment that local businesses make in the students, through one-to-one mentoring, classroom lectures and the provision of six-week internships. “Having a mentor gave me the courage to talk to my tutors when I was worried about coursework,” she says.The payback for employers is not immediate. Many graduates of career academies go on to university. Others join the workforce at 18 but not necessarily on the payroll of the organisations that mentored them.No matter, says Katey Neate, an assistant vice-president at the Bank of New York Mellon’s Manchester offices. By raising teenagers’ aspirations, employers are priming the local talent pool which, ultimately, feeds their business.“A vocational course in financial services is the breeding ground for our future recruitment,” she says.Whatever the long-term benefits, the career academy model makes big demands of educators and their business partners. To host an academy, schools and colleges must forge links with local businesses and appoint an advisory board comprised of employers.For employers themselves, particularly those that take on interns, the biggest worry is that in opening their workplace to untrained teenagers they might distract their own people.Lucinda Scott, a regional manager at Yorkshire Bank, accepted two interns last year. Wary of the potential repercussions for the performance of her business, she planned their deployment carefully. “We put them with very experienced people [chosen from a pool of volunteers] who were so on top of their jobs that we knew they could help someone slower without being stressed.” In the event, Ms Scott says, all went well. So much so that after the standard six weeks one of the interns stayed on for the remainder of the vacation. One unanswered question is whether, as the academies multiply, enough business volunteers can be found to preserve the one-to-one relationships with students that make the programme uniqueSo far at least, monitoring by the schools suggests the initiative is succeeding in its aim of lifting the achievement of post 16-year-olds and extending their career horizons. In 2007, 92 per cent of career academy graduates went on to university or an equivalent level of training linked to employment. Judged by their GSCE grades, only 40 per cent of the group had been predicted to do so.Individual stories support the statistics. Nineteen-year-old Imamma Lashari, a talented student from Newham College in east London, did her internship with Citigroup. She hopes one day to return there as an investment banker. Yet originally, Ms Lashari, who has a place to study economics, banking and finance at university, had thoughts of studying medicine.“When I found the finance course, I said that’s me,” she says.“To be honest, if I’d stuck with medicine, I’d, probably, have dropped out.”
695;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Third-party intermediaries part of repo solution;;When Bear Stearns collapsed in March, a little-known and crucial source of financing for banks, the tri-party repurchase market, was thrust into the spotlight.Policymakers were quick to express alarm at how financial institutions rely heavily on funding via repurchase, or repo, trades that are conducted between banks and investors under the auspices of third-parties such as JPMorgan and The Bank of New York Mellon, as clearing entities.The drumbeat of regulatory alarm has continued with the release of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group Report last month. The group of senior officials from the US financial industry concluded that tri-party repo “could pose systemic risk issues”.At last week’s meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman spoke about improving the resiliency of tri-party repo. “We are encouraging firms to improve their management of liquidity risk and to reduce over time their reliance on tri-party repos for overnight financing of less-liquid forms of collateral,” said Mr Bernanke.In tri-party repo, a custodian bank acts as an intermediary and alleviates the administrative burden between two parties engaging in the trade. An investor lends cash for a specified period. The institution borrowing those funds provides collateral that can include Treasury bonds and other fixed-income securities. In recent years, the use of lower quality assets such as mortgages became popular.The over-reliance on using such illiquid assets ultimately sparked an old-fashioned run on Bear Stearns, when investors cut their repo funding. “Blaming tri-party repo is like blaming a car for speeding,” said Art Certosimo, executive vice-president of BoNY Mellon. “It is the driver, or in this case, dealers, who were the cause of the problem.”Mr Certosimo said Bear Stearns did not have enough good collateral in order to balance out its holdings of collateralised debt obligations and other asset-backed securities.Fear of a system-wide collapse focuses on the fact that two clearers are responsible for tri-party trades and that, in a period of intense market stress, they may not be able to unwind trades. However, last week Mr Bernanke said improving the tri-party market “might be facilitated by the introduction of a central counterparty but may also be achievable under the current framework for clearing and settlement”.Mr Certosimo said: “The Fed has taken a measured approach to understanding the market associated with tri-party repo.”Since Bear’s demise, tri-party repo has experienced a sharp reduction in the use of lower quality assets.Collateral including all private label mortgage-backed securities was the fastest growing segment of tri-party repo between July 2006 and July 2007, as it climbed from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, according to BoNY Mellon.Between July 2007 and July 2008, this type of collateral has fallen to 17 per cent.The use of Treasuries has climbed from 14 per cent to 21 per cent, indicating that tri-party repo investors have veered towards safer assets.
696;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-08-27T02:27:48Z;ADCB files suit over losses of UK-based SIV;;Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank has filed a lawsuit against two US banks and two rating agencies over losses from a collapsed $6bn structured investment vehicle, formerly managed by London-based hedge fund Cheyne Capital.In the suit in a US court, the bank, which is majority owned by the largest of the United Arab Emirates, is seeking unspecified damages from Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, Moody’s Investors Services and Standard & Poor’s.The suit alleges investors were misled over the quality of assets held by the SIV, a vehicle that was part of an industry that was worth $400bn (£217bn, €272bn) before it was decimated by the credit crunch. The crunch cut the value of asset-backed and other financial debt these vehicles invested in, while also causing their funding to evaporate.The SIV was put into administration last year and some assets have been auctioned off – a process that was organised by Deloitte & Touche and Goldman Sachs – to repay senior creditors who wished to get back a cash recovery. Senior investors who took the cash got about 60 cents in the dollar overall, while junior investors have been left with nothing.“The legal action alleges, among other things, that ADCB was misled about the quality of the underlying mortgages in which the Cheyne SIV would invest,” a spokesman for the bank said on Tuesday.ADCB has applied for class-action status for the suit and said it had held talks with other banks in the Gulf Co-operation Council and investors about joining the action.“Based on these conversations, ADCB expects additional investors to join or support the legal action as required,” the bank said.Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while the others from whom the bank is seeking damages did not return calls requesting comment late on Tuesday.ADCB is one of the few banks in the Middle East to acknowledge publicly its total exposure of about Dh1bn ($272m) to the subprime crisis through investments in SIVs and other instruments.The decision to go public and provide some transparency is at odds with the secretive nature of other financial institutions in the region.Last year, it set aside Dh560m to cover the exposure, causing its profits to fall 3 per cent to Dh2.085bn. It then made another Dh70m provision in the first quarter this year and Dh40m in the second quarter.Eirvin Knox, ADCB’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that his bank was fully provided for in one form or another for its exposure to these vehicles and that he did not expect to make further provisions in the second half of this year.Additional reporting by Paul J Davies in London
697;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Financial sector fears stem dollar rally;;The dollar pulled back from its recent highs on Thursday as fresh worries emerged over the health of the US financial system.The dollar has rallied strongly since the start of the month, climbing more than 5 per cent against the euro, amid a growing conviction that the credit crisis caused more damage to economies outside of the US than previously thought.But the focus fell back on the US on Thursday amid reports in the Financial Times that Lehman Brothers failed to offload 50 per cent of its shares to Korean and Chinese investors and fresh worries over Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the US mortgage groups.Analysts said the rise in oil prices triggered by the heightening of tensions between Russia and Nato had also weighed on the dollar, raising fears over growth prospects in the US, the world’s largest energy consumer.The dollar fell 1 per cent to $1.4890 against the euro, lost 0.8 per cent to $1.8772 against the pound and had dropped 1.1 per cent to SFr1.0870 against the Swiss franc late in New York trade.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said, given that momentum indicators were showing many leading currencies had hit their most oversold levels against the dollar in more than a decade, the dip in the dollar was good news, allowing investors to catch their breath.However, he said the dollar’s upward momentum was likely to be maintained, given the actions of Asian central banks, which have been intervening in the market to support their currencies against a rising dollar.South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines have all been active in the market.Mr Derrick said this would see Asian central bank’s foreign exchange reserves fall, lessening reserve managers’ need to diversify away from the dollar and weakening their appetite for currencies such as the euro.“At the very least it would suggest a very sharp decline in the overall pace of euro purchases with some managers even becoming net sellers to keep their reserves balanced,” he said. “We suspect this shift is one of the key underlying forces driving the currency markets.”Meanwhile, the yen advanced more strongly against the dollar, rising 1.3 per cent to Y108.53 as falling equities heightened risk aversion and increased the haven appeal of the low-yielding yen.Analysts said the yen had also found some support from the release of Japan’s trade data for July. Figures showed that falling demand from the US was offset by a rise in exports to Asia. Indeed, Japanese exports to China at Y1,200bn surpassed US exports for the first time in post war history.Lee Hardman at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ said he expected the yen to continue to rally on the news. “We favour holding short dollar/yen positions initially targeting support at Y107.70,” he said.The yen also rose 0.4 per cent to Y161.15 against the euro, climbed 0.8 per cent to Y95.11 against the Australian dollar and gained 0.6 per cent to Y203.37 against the pound.
698;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
699;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-08-18T14:01:10Z;Dollar hits the comeback trail;;"Since hitting a record low against the euro a month ago, the dollar has risen more than 7 per cent as differences in growth expectations between the major economies widen.At the same time, sterling has slipped below the $1.90 level for the first time in nearly two years, and against the yen, the dollar has recovered from a 13-year low to record its highest levels this year.Does the current dollar rally mark a fundamental change in sentiment towards the US currency? And has the Federal Reserve done enough to avert a recession? Or is the dollar merely experiencing its own bear-market rally?Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, answers readers’ questions below.————————————————————————————————–Is the US dollar rally sustainable or is it just a short-term adjustment? How far can the recovery go?
June YanSimon Derrick: By far the most popular topic of discussion today has been the forces behind the dollar’s rally over the past month. June’s question neatly encapsulates the main thrust of many of the e-mails I have read.Perhaps the best way to think about the performance of the dollar is to focus in on euro/dollar (for me the benchmark currency pair) and to ask what has driven it over the past few years. In particular, one of the things that we have focused on has been how closely the price movements here have tracked those of gold against the dollar (far more so than many of the “commodity” currencies). If we understand why this happened then we should also be able to get a handle on what has happened since July.Identifying the real drivers behind gold price movements over the years has always been a difficult task. However, looking back at the rally that emerged in early September of last year, it seems clear that a number of related factors were at work. The first was a concern about the inflationary impact of the Federal Reserve entering an aggressive easing cycle (it is worth remembering that gold rallied by 63 per cent through the last easing cycle) while the second was a desire to hold a safe-haven asset at a time of financial crisis (as occurred during the second ERM debacle in 1993). With the European Central Bank maintaining it’s hawkish stance and the perception that the eurozone economy was less exposed to the impact of the credit crisis than the US, it is fairly easy to see why the euro started to perform in a similar fashion to gold.Since July 14th, however, all this has changed as oil prices have collapsed (which seems a logical move given the slowdown in the global economy), worries over the threat of inflation have eased and investors have started to believe that the Fed’s bold gamble will now pay off. In this environment the ECB’s continued focus on the threat from inflation is becoming increasingly less attractive for investors. Similarly, the need to hold gold as a “store of value” has fallen dramatically in the face of an apparently waning inflationary threat.Will this continue? I believe that the answer is yes. Slowing growth both in emerged and emerging markets will lead to further downward pressure on commodity prices (crude oil imports into China fell 7 per cent month on month in July) and declining inflationary concerns. With these out of the way, the US is suddenly starting to look remarkably well positioned to deal with the rough economic weather ahead. A declining trade deficit (once we strip out energy imports), a highly competitively priced currency (the US dollar index is close to all time lows) and a pro-growth central bank make for a highly attractive currency package in the circumstances.————————————————————————————————–How would you expect any worsening of current geopolitical tensions between the US and Russia (over its stance on Georgia) and the between the west and Iran (over its nuclear programme)?
Oliver Dowd, LondonSD: The first thing to acknowledge here is the very lack of reaction in the commodity and currency markets over the past few weeks to geopolitical tensions (particularly events in South Ossetia and beyond). I suspect that this says a great deal about the power of some of the forces already working themselves out in the markets.However, if we are to get closer to an understanding of how these geopolitical issues could affect the currency markets then we need to go back and look at the impact of similar events at the end of the last great commodity bubble at the very start of the 1980s. In particular it is worth remembering the markets reaction to the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union on December 24, 1979. At that point precious metals prices had been locked in an aggressive uptrend for a year and a half (gold had risen from $200 an ounce to $800 an ounce) while the dollar continued to fall, much as it had done for the past four years (despite the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy sharply in October 1979). Although the dollar did continue to fall for a couple of weeks after the invasion, by early January it had actually begun to recover. Indeed, between January 8 and April 7 the dollar index rallied a robust 11.5 per cent while the gold price reversed its trend slightly later in the month.Interestingly, this was not the only occasion that the response to geopolitical events has been for the dollar to rally sharply. Most notably, the surprise Israeli air strike against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor on June 7, 1981, subsequently saw the dollar rally sharply while gold plunged in the months afterwards.Given this and the current shift in thinking in the currency markets, my suspicion is that, if anything, recent events will only hasten a flight to safety into the dollar.————————————————————————————————–Do you think that the Federal Reserve can avert a recession with the introduction of financial policies and regulations in the US only? What is the present role of the US Government’s strategy in economics and finances in the US dollar valuation?
Viktor O. Ledenyov, UkraineSD: Whether the Fed can avert a recession remains open to question. However, it appears to be in as good a position as any central bank could be to deal with the threat given the bold moves made since August 17th last year. I certainly think it has no reason to be overcritical of itself heading to Jackson Hole this weekend.The broader issue of US currency policy is also an interesting one. In particular, I find the apparent change in emphasis seen over the past six months a curious one. After six years or so of following a policy that we can best characterise as “benign neglect” towards the dollar, it seems that the US administration is now rather more interested than it has been in the past in stemming these losses.Indeed, the FT carried a story in early May that quoted an unnamed senior US official as saying that “the US and Europe now have a united desire to see the dollar strengthen against the euro.” Although I certainly don’t believe that intervention has really been considered in the past six months (other than as a backstop in case of extreme moves), I do think this change of emphasis is meaningful.Although it is impossible to give an exact reason for this apparent change of heart, I do note the concerns expressed by China’s Premier Wen in March and June of this year about the weakness of the dollar. I also remember a comment that emerged from Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister last November that indicated that the Kingdom’s rulers would prefer not to see the dollar collapse.————————————————————————————————–Has China has beeen forced to, at least temporarly, abandon its reduction in buying US dollars and the associated appreciation of the renminbi that came with this move, and has it returned to a position of buying dollars once again to maintain the profit margin in order to continue its growth and the employement of its citizens? I believe the explosive increase in the cost base that has impacted China’s profit margin will force the revaluation of the appreciation schedule of the renminbi. Do you agree with this?
John DiChiara, Delray Beach FloridaSD: I can never resist a good question about the renminbi, so here goes. Firstly, I agree with your view that there has likely been a significant shift in Chinese currency policy in recent weeks. The publication of a statement from China’s Politburo in late July seemed to confirm that a change of economic priorities is on the cards. Instead of focusing on the need to prevent the economy from over heating, it now seems that the leadership believes: ”We should treat maintaining stable but rapid economic growth and controlling excessive rises in prices as our top priorities in macroeconomic controls.”Although the Politburo statement did not mention exchange rate policy, it is noticeable that a marked change in behaviour has emerged in the performance of dollar/renminbi since the middle of last month (when capital controls were tightened to curb inflows of speculative money). Instead of the steady renminbi gains that had been the norm since late last year, the trend now has been towards a gradual weakening of China’s currency. It is also worth noting that the NDF (non-deliverable forwards) market is moving rapidly towards forecasting no further gains for the renminbi over the coming year.Somewhat paradoxically, it isn’t immediately apparent to me that a move to stabilise dollar/renminbi will necessarily lead to a pick up in the pace of FX reserve growth. After all the pace of growth in China’s FX reserves actually picked up in the first half of this year (increasing from $1,520bn to $1,800bn) despite a 56 per cent collapse in the local equity market, a slowdown in the global economy and a rapidly appreciating currency. Only time will tell but I really would not be surprised if the pace of growth in China’s FX reserves actually started to decline in the months ahead.If the combination of new capital controls and the reduced promise of currency appreciation does lead to a significant decline in hot money inflows into China and, as a result, a slowdown in the growth of FX reserves, this may also have a significant impact on the broader markets. In particular, it seems reasonable to assume that a slowdown in reserve growth would reduce the need to diversify these reserves at the margins into other currencies such as the euro.————————————————————————————————–There seemed to be general agreement that the Bank of England inflation forecast of a drop in the consumer price index to 2 per cent within two years offers a chance for a cut in rates, possibly even this year. How is this possible when the forecast itself is based on rates staying at 5 per cent for those two years? Also does the negative real interest rate in the US not provide a greater disincentive to holding dollars than the prospect of faster economic growth than the rest of the OECD countries?
Marcus Hardie, LondonSD: I think there are two key points to consider when thinking about the inflation report. The first is that the Bank’s central forecast is for inflation to stand just below the 2 per cent target in two years time if rates move in line with the market yield curve as it stood prior to its publication. Although the yield curve at that point assumed that borrowing costs would stay almost flat around the current 5 per cent over the next nine months, there was also a built in assumption in the markets that the Bank would ease at least once at some point next year.Secondly, the key two words in the forecast were “just below”. In other words, even if the Bank acted as the market expected when the report was being compiled then it would still end up undershooting its target. Hence the talk of multiple rate cuts now starting to circulate.In fairness, there is a third factor at work and that is the pace of declines being seen in the commodity markets. Oil has already fallen 22 per cent from its peak in July on the back of growing signs of a slowdown in demand globally. Although it will take a while for the impact of these falls to work through the system, central bankers do not have the luxury of being able to wait to see what happens given the lagged effect of monetary policy shifts. The deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia summed this up nicely last week when he noted: “We cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late.”————————————————————————————————–Trade deficits should beget declining currencies. If this were the only factor to influence a currency, should we not still have a natural supply of dollars rolling out of the large US deficit until that narrows, or transforms to a surplus? Also, is it not the case that Japanese and Swiss investors are likely to repatriate their dollar-denominated investments if we see a return to the flight from risk that has been a major theme of 2008 so far? Basically, I can’t see a sustained dollar rally against other major currencies as being based on any current fundamentals (with the exception of the UK where the housing bubble is yet to fully implode, and the trade deficit remains large) - what am I missing here?
Oliver Sherman, LondonSD: You are absolutely correct to say that if trade deficits were the only factor to influence currencies then the dollar should remain under pressure for some time yet. However, there are several factors to consider here.The first is that US trade deficit in goods and services has stabilised over the past four years as the impact of a more competitively priced dollar has begun to make itself felt. Indeed, it has come in below the $60bn mark four times this year despite record oil prices. This brings me to the important second point that if we strip out oil then the trade deficit has actually been shrinking at a very healthy pace. Notably, the trade deficit ex-petroleum collapsed to $20.4bn in June from $26.4bn. With the demand for oil slowing (early reports suggest that the current US driving season is proving very quiet indeed) and prices falling rapidly, the trade deficit looks set to improve materially in July and August. In other words, it looks like things are getting better.The broader point, of course, is that over the past 20 years, trade flows have played a decreasing role in determining currency direction as cross border investment flows (both private and official) have come to dominate the market. It is worth remembering that the dollar rally between 1995 and the start of 2002 came at a time when the US trade deficit ballooned out to record levels.The question of what Japanese investors will do in overseas bond markets is also an interesting one. Although it is true that the official data show Japanese investors bringing money back home from overseas bond markets over the past two weeks, the broad trend is still for them to seek the higher yields available overseas. With little chance of a shift in official rates domestically (the talk today is that the BOJ will downgrade their assessment of the economy once again) and a currency that has slid steadily against the dollar since March (dollar/yen has risen from Y95 to now stand above Y110) I would guess that the US still looks like a relatively attractive option.————————————————————————————————–Is the UK economy fundamentally weaker than the EU economy, and will sterling begin to chart its own course independent of both dollar and euro?
Daniel C. Massey, Houston, TexasSD: I think a better way to express this is to say that the UK economy has entered its downturn rather sooner than core Europe. Although we can debate over the exact reasons for this, I would argue that it likely comes down to the relatively greater role that the financial sector (and the housing market) plays in the UK economy when compared to the eurozone. It is very noticeable that sterling’s initial collapse against the euro came in the immediate aftermath of the Northern Rock news and that its subsequent decline over the next six months (a move not dissimilar in scale to that seen when it came out of the ERM in 1992) echoed growing levels of concern among investors about the finance sector. We certainly noted a close correlation between the pound’s losses through this period and the outflows we monitored of foreign capital from UK financial sector stocks (via our own cross-border custodial data).Although I still think that there is likely to be a further wave of weakness for sterling, I’m actually pretty positive about the longer term picture against the euro. The very fact that the UK has maintained its monetary policy independence means that the BoE can now act in as flexible a manner as possible to deal with the problems in the housing market. As a result, my guess would be that the worst might be over by this time next year (although I acknowledge that this is an essentially optimistic view). In contrast, all the signs are that the ECB will be slow to cut rates. For those economies at the margins (Spain most obviously) this sounds like bad news. As a result I wouldn’t be surprised to see a sustained recovery emerging for sterling against the euro by next summer.————————————————————————————————–What barriers exist to prevent the dollar from continuing to appreciate against the other major currencies?
Steve Shimwell, Antibes, Cote D’AzurSD: My own feeling is that this primarily comes down to whether you believe that the commodity price bubble is over yet. If it isn’t then I could well imagine the situation reverting back to where we were in the early part of the summer.The longer term question however, is over whether the Fed repeats the mistakes of 2002/2003/2004 by keeping policy too loose for too long. Although we just can’t say what the Bernanke Fed will do this time out, what we do know is that the Fed proved rather more nimble over the past year in moving to cut rates aggressively when it thought it necessary than it has done on some occasions in the past (the second half of 2008 springs to mind). This does encourage me that this time around the Fed’s approach will be rather more nuanced than it has been before. In short I don’t think it will repeat past mistakes."
700;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-08-07T18:45:14Z;Trichet warning on growth dents euro;;The euro gave back early gains on Thursday, hitting a seven-week low against the dollar after Jean Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, sounded a warning over growth.The ECB as expected left eurozone interest rates unchanged at 4.25 per cent after its policy meeting.In the post-decision press conference, however, Mr Trichet said he expected economic growth in the eurozone to “weaken substantially” this year. But he appeared to take the prospect of an interest rate cut off the agenda, saying inflation was expected to remain above the bank’s target.Michael Woolfolk, at Bank of New York Mellon, said the ensuing sell-off in the euro indicated that the market reacted negatively to the ECB’s reluctance to consider lowering rates on weaker growth as long as inflation remains high.“The rather counter-intuitive reaction to Mr Trichet’s unambiguously hawkish remarks not only underscores the current bullish sentiment over the dollar, but also reflects the deteriorating outlook for the eurozone,” he said.By midday in New York, the euro had fallen 0.2 per cent to $1.5378 against the euro and eased 0.3 per cent to Y168.38 against the yen.The euro also lost 0.1 per cent to £0.7904 against the pound as the Bank of England, as widely predicted, kept UK rates on hold at 5 per cent after its policy meeting. Elsewhere, the dollar extended its sharp gains.The dollar index, which tracks its progress against a basket of six major currencies, hit a near six-month high after a rise in US pending home sales in June.David Deddouche, at Société Générale, said the economic impact of the financial crisis had been isolated to the US, but it was clearer that it was spreading to the rest of the world’s major economies.“In FX markets it is always the relative change in perception that matters most – this is having a major impact on prices and that’s why we are seeing such a sharp dollar rally,” he said.The dollar rose 0.1 per cent to $1.9444 against the pound, climbed 0.1 per cent to SFr1.0596 against the Swiss franc and gained 0.2 per cent to C$1.0500 against the Canadian dollar.The dollar eased back from a seven-month high against the yen, however, falling 0.1 per cent to Y109.50 as traders booked profits after its strong run.Elsewhere, the Australian dollar failed to sustain its initial gains after employment came in stronger than expected in July.Hans Redeker, at BNP Paribas, said the inability of the Aussie to rally was not surprising given the figures would do little to stop the Reserve Bank of Australia from cutting interest rates in the face of an impending economic slowdown.The Australian dollar fell 0.1 per cent to $0.9086 against the dollar.
701;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-08-03T10:54:22Z;Outlook: ECB poised to revise sanguine view on growth;;Central bankers have some tough decisions to make this week. As growth continues to slow, the economy could benefit from a fillip provided by lower rates but inflation continues to run above targets and recent declines in oil prices are unlikely to have had much impact.The Federal Reserve, along with the US Treasury, has attempted to talk up the dollar in its efforts to tackle inflation in recent months but it is not expected to move the Fed funds rate from its current 2 per cent on Tuesday.Given the recent testimony to Congress, chairman Ben Bernanke’s accompanying statement is unlikely to shift far from the stance taken then to recognise the risk of rising prices.“A bolstering of its hawkish rhetoric might well keep the dollar headed in the direction that the US Treasury has endeavoured to engineer these past three months,” says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee meets on Thursday and, while there is little likelihood of a move from the current base rate of 5 per cent, it is possible – given discussions at its July meeting – that rates could be increased or cut.Minutes from the July meeting revealed a split panel, with seven members voting for no change, one member calling for a quarter-point increase and the remaining vote for a quarter-point cut.“The three-way split in the MPC’s voting in July encapsulates the predicament that the Bank of England is in over a deepening and widening economic slowdown, yet elevated and still rising inflation,” says Howard Archer at Global Insight.The European Central Bank also meets on Thursday, having witnessed a marked slowdown since it raised the main refinancing rate a quarter point to 4.25 per cent last month.Manufacturing output is slowing, and Tuesday’s purchasing manager’s index is expected to show service sector activity going the same way.A reversal of last month’s increase is unlikely, but analysts believe Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, will indicate inflation is not the bank’s sole concern.“The economy is slowing and we are convinced that the ECB will progressively soften its sanguine view on growth,” says Aurelio Maccario at UniCredit.But Christoph Rieger, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, believes Mr Trichet will have to tread carefully when delivering the central bank’s statement this time round. “The last two press conferences triggered both the largest sell-off and the largest rally ever on an ECB meeting, suggesting to us the bank may have lost touch with markets.”Australia’s main interest rate stands at 7.25 per cent – one of the developed world’s biggest. The country’s Reserve Bank is not expected to lower rates on Tuesday, but was reported last week to be considering a cut at its next meeting.
702;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;View of the day: Brazilian real under threat;;The Brazilian real’s resilience in the face of a sharp retreat for the country’s stock market could soon be under threat, argues Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He notes that at the end of May, Brazil’s Bovespa index, was up about 16 cent from the start of the year, making it one of the world’s best performing indices.“However, the end of May also marked the turning point in the Bovespa’s fortunes,” Mr Mellor points out. “With a fall of some 21 per cent since the start of June, the Bovespa is now vying for worst performing market.”He notes that thanks largely to the country’s attractive short-term yields, the real - which is hovering around nine-year highs against the dollar - has yet to follow suit.But if recent trends in investor flows gather momentum, the real’s ascendancy may come under threat, he warns.While the outflows have not been particularly large, their consistency is notable. “Indeed, since mid-June, outflows have exceeded inflows by a factor of more than six to one – with only four days of recorded inflows over the period.“Over the past four years, the correlation between net inflows into Brazilian equities and the real’s performance against the dollar comes in at more than 89 per cent.“Even with the lure of interest rates of 13 per cent, the closeness of this relationship raises the question of whether it is time for investors to modify their positions.”

704;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-07-20T22:12:56Z;Tough year for US public pension funds;;US public pension funds have had their worst returns in six years, losing an average of more than 4 per cent in the year to June 30, that puts them under even greater pressure to meet their growing liabilities.The average plan’s funded status has declined by close to 5 per cent during the year, taking it well below 100 per cent to be only 96 per cent funded, according to BNY Mellon.Until now funding had been improving, after five years of positive returns.The 40 largest public pension plans had a median loss of 4.3 per cent during the fiscal year, according to data from Northern Trust, which will be released this week.That compares with a return of more than 17 per cent last year. This year’s loss is close to the loss of 4.8 per cent in 2001, which was the worst for pension funds in the 11 years from 1997.Smaller pension funds usually post lower returns than large ones, so the total national average is probably lower.The typical public pension fund has 60 per cent of its money in equities and almost every stock market index in the world fell during the 12 months to June.Some, such as Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Europe’s Stoxx 50, fell by more than 20 per cent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 fell by 13 per cent.Fixed income, which typically accounts for a quarter of a pension fund, remained largely flat.Those funds that had big investments in commodities did slightly better, as their commodities paid off. However, federal lawmakers are holding hearings into whether pension funds should be restricted in their commodities investments, in case this adds to speculative fever in the asset class.Calpers, the biggest state fund, invested more than $1bn into oil and commodities last year – its first such investment – and has seen returns of close to 70 per cent on the portfolio.However, that represents only a sliver of the fund’s $240bn in assets. Calpers estimated it lost 2.4 per cent during the year to June 30, it said on Friday.The poor returns come as the US Governmental Accounting Standards board met two weeks ago to begin changing accounting rules to make the pensions more accurately report returns and liabilities.Under the current system, the funds paint an overly optimistic picture of their finances, say critics of the system.Even as pension fund returns shrink and liabilities widen, some state governments are giving their state employees higher pension benefits, further increasing the pressure on the funds and ensuring even greater liabilities. Most public pension funds have a fiscal year that ends in June.
705;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-07-17T20:35:53Z;Wall Street rallies on banks’ earnings;;The S&P 500 rallied for a second session on Thursday and edged back out of bear market territory as better-than-expected results from JPMorgan and another sharp drop in oil prices cheered investors.The day began in ebullient mood with stocks rising sharply after a number of leading banks and fund managers reported results.JPMorgan said profit fell 52 per cent to $2bn due to costs from the takeover of Bear Stearns in March and mortgage-related writedowns. But that was a smaller fall than expected.Shares in JPMorgan rose 13.5 per cent to $40.80, adding to the biggest one-day gain in almost six years that they made on Wednesday.PNC Financial Services Group, the Pittsburgh-based bank, and BlackRock, the asset manager, also posted better-than-expected earnings, while Merrill Lynch soothed investors by selling its stake in Bloomberg back to the data and services company for $4.5bn.PNC rose 13.5 per cent to $65.75, BlackRock added 16.2 per cent to $207.98 and Merrill advanced 9.8 per cent to $30.73.An exception to the positive news was the Bank of New York Mellon, which said second-quarter profits slumped 31 per cent to $309m on costs related to certain tax issues. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $35.42.The financial sector as a whole jumped 6.1 per cent in early trading while an index of investment banking shares rose 7.3 per cent.Analysts warned that any relief rally was likely to be short-lived. A number of them downgraded or cut their earnings forecasts for Wells Fargo, whose estimate-beating results on Wednesday spurred the biggest ever gain in financial shares and the biggest one-day rally on the S&P 500 since April.Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup analyst, said: “We expect to see a pick up in dilutive capital raises in the third quarter and increased concerns about spillover into commercial credit quality, which should continue to pressure [banking] stocks.”The benchmark S&P 500 pared gains late in the day but still closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,259.97 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 11,438.92 points, while the Nasdaq Composite finished 1.2 per cent higher at 2,312.30 points.In the past few weeks, earnings reports have been one of the only bright spots in an avalanche of bad news centring on the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.With 11 per cent of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter earnings so far, 72 per cent have beat expectations, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The number is even more surprising given that 34 per cent of the companies that have reported were financials.Outside of the financial sector, earnings reports were mixed on Thursday however. Danaher and United Technologies both beat analysts’ quarterly earnings expectations thanks in part to solid overseas sales and a weaker dollar. Danaher rose 6.2 per cent to $80.90, while United climbed 5.9 per cent to $64.70.Textron, however, held the sector to a 1.5 per cent gain after it noted rising energy costs and the weaker economy and forecast third-quarter profits that fell short of expectations. Textron slid 5.9 per cent to $43.25.Coca-Cola also disappointed investors. The world’s largest soft-drink maker said second-quarter profit fell after writedowns at its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. Coca-Cola holds a 35 per cent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises.Coca-Cola fell 3.8 per cent to $50.34 while Coca-Cola Enterprises, which posted a $3.17bn second-quarter loss, fell 0.1 per cent to $16.83.Those results, and poor same-store sales forecasts from Safeway, knocked the consumer staples sector into the red. Safeway fell 10.8 per cent to $26.78, while the sector lost 0.5 per cent.Market gains were also limited by some poor macro-economic data showing moderately higher rates of unemployment and further weakness in the housing sector.In the background, oil prices fell for a third day, helping consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks.Carnival rose 9.7 per cent to $36.42, while General Motors climbed 11.9 per cent to $12.85. Sherwin-Williams also rose 12.3 per cent to $53.86 after the paint retailer said second-quarter profit fell less than analysts estimated.
706;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Overview: Equities recover as oil falls;;"Another steep drop in crude oil prices offered some much-needed respite to US and European equity markets on Wednesday and helped the dollar pull away from Tuesday’s record low against the euro.Oil’s slide back towards $130 a barrel took some of the sting out of a robust set of US inflation figures, which had rekindled talk of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.That came after headline US consumer prices climbed by 1.1 per cent in June, way ahead of forecasts, and taking the year-on-year increase to 5 per cent – the highest annual rate for 17 years. Commodity prices rose 1.9 per cent in June, the largest ever monthly gain. The core consumer price index – which excludes volatile food and energy prices – rose 0.3 per cent last month and was up 2.4 per cent over the year.Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told a House of Representatives panel that inflation was “too high”, as he reiterated that restoring calm to financial markets was a top priority of the Fed.Meanwhile, the release of the Fed’s meeting minutes from June revealed that policy makers saw “diminished” risks for growth and increased risks to inflation, with many thinking the next rate move could be a hike.Analysts at Bank of New York Mellon said: “Headline inflation is rising so quickly now that it appears to be spilling into the core faster than anticipated. Unless there is some relief in crude oil prices soon, the Fed will be forced to raise rates to maintain its credibility.”Right on cue, West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark US oil price, fell as much as $6 a barrel after data showed an unexpected increase in US crude stockpiles last week.August WTI later settled at $134.60 a barrel, down $4.14 on the day, and more than 8 per cent below Friday’s record high of $147.27. Gold fell more than 1 per cent as it took its cue from oil’s retreat.Equity markets got a boost from the oil price decline, as well as some better news on the US banking sector. In New York, the S&P 500 closed up 2.5 per cent. Financials were lifted by better-than-expected quarterly results and a dividend increase at the regional bank Wells Fargo.The better tone helped European stocks stage a moderate rally. The pan-
European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended 0.5 per cent higher, having been down 1.6 per cent, while the Xetra Dax index rose 1.1 per cent.Asian markets had a quieter session as banking stocks recouped some of Tuesday’s steep losses.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average edged up 0.1 per cent and Hong Kong added 0.2 per cent, although Taipei continued to slide.European and US credit markets were little changed as trading turned choppy. The investment-grade iTraxx Europe index rose 1 basis point to 104.75bp while the CDX North America index narrowed 5bp to 139bp.US government bonds fell sharply in price as the CPI data rocked sentiment. The yield on the 30-year Treasury jumped 13bp to 4.60 per
cent, while the policy-sensitive two-year yield rose 6bp to 2.46 per cent.Fed funds futures continued to price in only a slim 7 per cent chance of a quarter-point rise in US interest rates next month, with odds of a rate hike in October around 50 per cent. Agency debt issued by Fannie and Freddie widened over Treasury yields for the third day running. But European bonds were broadly flat, even as the annual rate of eurozone consumer price inflation was confirmed at 4 per cent – the highest level since it hit 4.2 per cent in April 1992.Nick Kounis, chief European economist at Fortis Global Markets, said he believed core inflation had embarked on an upward trend as past rises in commodity prices and rising labour costs feed through.“Building evidence of second round effects should keep the European Central Bank’s inflation worries very much alive,” Mr Kounis said. He expects a 25-basis point rise in the fourth quarter, followed by an additional one in the first quarter of 2009, pushing the ECB’s overnight rate to 4.75 per cent.On the currency markets, the dollar was helped by oil’s decline and a reference by Mr Bernanke to the possibility of intervention in support of the US currency.Sterling fell back below the $2 mark after news of a big rise in UK unemployment last month damped speculation of interest rate rises."
707;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-07-15T16:02:25Z;Dollar leads the ‘ugly parade’;;The fallout from the US rescue plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Tuesday sent dollar bulls scuttling for cover while raising the question: how much more pain can the battered US currency take?Relief over the Treasury’s announcement that it would seek to provide funding for the two US government-sponsored mortgage groups has quickly been replaced by fears that conditions in the financial system are worsening.The dollar sell-off was broad-based. It drove the euro to a record high against the US currency – taking it back above $1.60, while the pound broke through $2, to its highest level since March. The greenback also fell more than 1 per cent against both the Swiss franc and the yen.The latest bout of weakness comes only a couple of months after some analysts had forecast a major improvement in the dollar’s fortunes. Rising US inflation prompted tough talk from Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman. He said the time of lower US interest rates was over, helping the currency to rally modestly between mid-April and mid-June.His comments were immediately trumped, however, by Jean-Claude Trichet at the European Central Bank who gave a clear signal that eurozone rates would soon be lifted. Mr Bernanke failed to back up his rhetoric with a rate rise, but Mr Trichet duly increased by 25 basis points to 4.25 per cent earlier this month.“Currency markets will always favour those central banks that take the fight to inflation,” says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.“And here the ECB is in pole position, while the Fed isn’t even on the starting grid.”Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets agrees that the Fed is hamstrung because it has a dual mandate to maintain employment and curb inflation, while the ECB just has an inflation target.“The deteriorating market and economic conditions in the US continue to be the chief causes of the broad decline in the US currency,” he says. “As long as these continue, the dollar will fall regardless of any jawboning by policy makers, which would be perceived as bluffing rather than communicating real policy intentions.”But some commentators believe recent waves of dollar selling have less to do with central banks and interest rates, and more to do with risk appetite.“It’s a drip feed of falling equities, particularly banks and financials, on to the dollar,” says David Bloom, head of forex at HSBC. “We’re slaves to all of this. We’re not creating market moves or moving of our own accord.”Mr Bloom said his forex trading team was watching slumping equities carefully to gauge how far the dollar would tumble.“It isn’t enough to just follow the main indices like the S&P, you have to look to aggregate indices for the banking sector, the brokers, the regional banks,” he says.“Suddenly in the FX market we’ve become experts on the components of equity markets,” he adds. “We don’t have a life of our own.”Hans Redeker, head of forex at BNP Paribas, says his team is watching the credit market for clues as to the dollar’s next moves. He says in the past three months a very strong correlation has developed between credit default swaps – which measure the perceived riskiness of corporate debt – and the dollar.Credit default swap indices have risen sharply in the past week as doubts about the solvency of Fannie and Freddie, as well as the demise of IndyMac, have reignited fears of systemic risk.Mr Redeker’s team follows the fluctuations in the credit default swaps of major banks and brokers, though, he says, the iTraxx Europe index of major European corporate credits is also a decent indicator.“An improvement in credit markets is one of the major conditions for a recovery in the dollar rate,” he says.But the US does not have a monopoly on fragile financial institutions. UK banks have also been badly burned by the subprime crisis, as have regional banks in Germany and Switzerland’s UBS.“The perception is the financial problems are worst in the US, followed by the UK, then Switzerland. It’s about degrees of revulsion, and at the moment, the most revolting currency is the dollar,” says Mr Bloom.Mr Mellor agrees: “It’s a matter of the ugly parade more than anything.”Finally, as the emerging markets around Asia struggle to battle double-digit inflation, an increasing number of central banks are using their dollar reserves to intervene in the foreign exchange market to shore up their own currencies in the battle to contain rising prices.Last week alone, it was estimated by traders that the Bank of Korea spent $8bn to slow the decline of its currency, the won. And Korea is not alone, with the Bank of Thailand and the Monetary Authority of Singapore among others thought to be actively intervening.For now, sentiment is also very much against the US currency. Several analysts pointed to the fact that even though Germany’s ZEW economic sentiment survey was much weaker than expected yesterday, the euro still rose.Mr Redeker says: “The euro is rising not because it is a glorious currency, but because people are desperate to get out of the dollar.”
708;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-07-08T14:44:32Z;View of the day: Dollar and inflation;;What will it take to reverse the dollar’s six-and-a-half year downtrend? asks Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He believes that in the absence of a dramatic recovery in the US economy, which would allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively, the best chance may come from a sudden abatement of global inflationary pressures.“Such a shift would presumably see investors turn from seeking out currencies with the most hawkish central banks to favouring those with the most growth-oriented policy stance,” he says. “In this situation, the dollar should be a natural winner.”However, with Nymex crude oil up more than 100 per cent year-on-year, and the CRB commodities index up nearly 50 per cent over the same period, there appears to be little to cheer about, Mr Derrick says.But he says there are some interesting signs for those looking for an easing of price pressures.He points to marked reversals in a number of basic foodstuffs, including rice and wheat, and a sharp drop in the Baltic Dry index, a measure of commodity shipping costs. Mr Derrick also notes that gold, normally a reliable indicator of inflation concerns, remains well below its mid-March levels.“All of this remains just tentative evidence that inflationary pressures may start to abate from here. However, with oil stumbling in the past 24 hours, perhaps now is the time to start looking for more evidence.”
709;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-07-06T17:11:15Z;Outlook: Inflation narrows Bank rate options;;Inflation continues to dominate the economic agenda, and this week the Bank of England decides how it can best balance the risk of slowing growth and rising prices.On Thursday, the Bank is expected to hold the UK base rate at 5 per cent as the pressure of inflation leaves it hamstrung in offering financial markets any assistance.“No change should be expected for the remainder of the year given that the Monetary Policy Committee is being blinded by a haze of uncertainty,” says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.The data that informs the Bank’s decision this week are unlikely to make cheerful reading.Recent surveys from purchasing managers and the Confederation of British Industry have indicated manufacturers are struggling as the price increases they have put through – forced on them by soaring input costs – are damping demand at home and abroad.Today’s manufacturing output report is expected to reflect these surveys. After rising 0.2 per cent in April, output is expected to have edged 0.1 per cent lower in May.May’s balance of trade figures, published on Wednesday, should also reflect sagging domestic and foreign demand and are likely to be little changed from April’s deficit of £7.59bn.With consumers being buffeted by a barrage of rising fuel and food costs and concerns about the housing market and the weakening economy, Wednesday’s consumer confidence index from Nationwide Building Society is expected to hit its lowest ebb since the measure was established in May 2004.On top of this, Halifax is expected to show further weakening in house prices as lending terms stretch buyer’s affordability to the limit.May pending home sales are among the slim pickings of economic data from the US this week and are expected to resume a weaker path following April’s surprise gain. Consumer confidence, measured by the University of Michigan, is seen moving lower.“The arrival of tax rebates has done nothing to lift the mood brought on by surging energy prices, falling house prices and rising joblessness,” said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics.The US trade deficit is likely to have widened in May as the cost of imported oil rose sharply over the month. Capital Economics estimates the deficit at $64bn in May from $60.9bn in April.Eurozone trade balances for May are due on Wednesday from France and Germany. Economists believe that neither will have moved much as the impact of oil imports has been partially offset by the euro’s strength against the dollar.
710;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-07-03T16:31:24Z;Euro falls as ECB raises rates 25bp;;The euro fell from a 10-week high against the dollar on Thursday after the European Central Bank indicated it might have reached the end of its monetary tightening cycle.The ECB, as expected, raised eurozone interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25 per cent after its policy meeting, saying that the move was aimed at preventing the growing risks poised by rising inflation.However, Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, said the move contributed to achieving the central bank’s aim of reining in price pressures in the region and warned of the risks of slowing growth.Analysts said the comments were less hawkish than expected, and implied the rate rise could be a one-off, in contrast to the series of rate rises that were priced into the markets.“The expectation was that the risk of a rate hike would be left on the table,” said Divyang Shah at Commonwealth Bank. “The message is that rates at 4.25 per cent are enough. There is no [hawkish] policy bias.”By midday in New York, the euro, which earlier in the session rose to a high of $1.5909 against the dollar, lost 1.2 per cent to $1.5703, eased 0.6 per cent to £0.7969 against the pound and dropped 0.3 per cent to Y167.68 against the yen.The dollar was supported by non-farm payrolls data showing the US economy shed 62,000 jobs outside the agricultural sector in June.Although the data was in line with expectations, analysts said the dollar’s positive reaction reflected relief that the figures did not reveal a bigger negative shock that had been feared in some quarters.Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon said while the non-farm payrolls data failed to live up to the accelerated deterioration that many dollar bears had been expecting, time was running out for the Federal Reserve to demonstrate that it was serious about anchoring US inflationary pressures.The dollar rose 0.9 per cent to Y106.80 against the yen, gained 1.3 per cent to SFr1.0273 against the Swiss franc and climbed 0.8 per cent to C$1.0140 against the Canadian dollar.The pound lost ground after a survey suggested activity in the UK services sector dropped to its lowest level in six years last month. Analysts said the figures were worrying given the dependence of the UK’s economy on the services sector and added to a series of dismal UK economic data that had heightened speculation the economy was headed for recession.The pound fell 0.6 per cent to $1.9823 against the dollar.The Swedish krona rose 0.9 per cent to SKr9.3985 against the euro after the country’s central bank raised interest rates by 25bp to 4.5 per cent and said it expected to tighten monetary policy twice more this year.
711;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-06-29T21:53:51Z;US legal eagles fly in for Moscow case;;"Titans of the US legal system will argue before a Moscow judge on Monday over a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit being brought under American law that is highly unusual – even by the standards of Russian justice.At issue is a $22.5bn damages claim against Bank of New York Mellon by the Russian Federal Customs Service with potentially far-reaching implications. It relates to a decade-old money laundering case that had been thought resolved.Bank of New York reached a $14m settlement with US federal prosecutors in 2005 after two Russian émigrés, one a bank vice-president, admitted helping to launder $7bn of Russian money in the late 1990s. Now Russia is demanding billions in unpaid taxes on the money.Russian customs has brought in Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor who advised on the defence of OJ Simpson, as an expert witness. They are also fielding Robert Blakey, an author of the US racketeer-influenced and corrupt organisations (Rico) statute – which they are trying to use in the Moscow Arbitration Court. Bank of New York’s lawyers are fielding Dick Thornburgh, a former attorney-general and Pennsylvania governor.The case is an important test of whether Rico can be applied outside the US. It will put a spotlight on President Dmitry Medvedev’s pledges to strengthen the Russian judiciary’s independence.As Mr Medvedev has admitted, Russian courts frequently become tools of state authorities or wealthy businessmen. Some Moscow observers suggest the BNY case could not have got this far without support from a high-level “sponsor” in government, the security services, or business – or one well-connected in all three areas.Podhurst Orseck, the Miami-based lawyers representing Russian customs in association with a Moscow firm, are demanding $22.5bn damages, based on claimed direct and indirect losses to the Russian budget of $7.5bn. Rico allows damages to be trebled on a punitive basis.BNY and its lawyers, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, insist the case is frivolous. They argue Rico claims cannot be brought outside the US, and a public, criminal law cannot be adjudicated on by a private commercial court.“To be in the Moscow [Arbitration] Court trying to bring a US public law case such as Rico is barred by Russian and US law,” says Jonathan Schiller, co-founder of Boies, Schiller & Flexner and lead counsel on the BNY case. Mr Thornburgh backs that argument.Mr Schiller also says the case lacks the two “predicate” crimes required for a Rico case. Bank of New York was never charged with or admitted to money-laundering, he says; it admitted only to monitoring failures. Lucy Edwards, the employee involved, and her husband Peter Berlin also admitted only to conspiracy to launder and violating reporting laws, not money-laundering itself.But Mr Dershowitz and Mr Blakey argue Rico can be applied outside the US. That question, not the case’s merits, is the focus of Monday's’s hearing, with BNY attempting to dismiss the case. “There is nothing in the Rico statute or legislative history that precludes the Russian court from applying Rico,” says Mr Dershowitz, who adds it is “very important” for Rico laws to be applied extra-territorially.He points out Rico is both a criminal and a civil law, and the Russians are seeking to apply only the civil part. “We have to prove that money laundering occurred, but that will not be hard to do. The burden of proof is much lighter in a civil case than in a criminal case.”This is raising questions about whether BNY should establish a reserve against a possible loss. Ken Thomas, an independent expert retained by the Russian side’s lawyers, wrote this month to Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, warning an adverse ruling could not just damage the 12-largest US bank but pose potential systemic risks.Mr Schiller says the bank has few assets that could be pursued in Russia, and a damages ruling could not be enforced in the US or many other countries where the bank has significant assets thanks to the “revenue rule” barring authorities from collecting foreign tax claims.“The US will not permit, and has not for 200 years, the application of a foreign government’s tax laws in the United States,” he says. “Just as Russia would not expect the US to collect its taxes over there.”BNY says US accounting rules require a reserve only if losses are “probable and reasonably estimable”."
712;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-06-26T15:31:02Z;Yen faces strong headwinds;;The yen looks to be in for a tough time in the months ahead, as foreign exchange investors shift their focus away from the turbulence on global asset markets towards interest rate differentials.“I’m as bearish on the yen now as at any time over the last decade,” says Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.Yesterday, the Japanese currency dropped to a record low of Y169.45 against the euro, surpassing the trough it hit just before credit-related volatility erupted on financial markets last July.Analysts say the move reflects the fact that the European Central Bank has all but guaranteed that it will raise eurozone interest rates in a bid to stem inflation next month, while the Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep rates on hold at the ultra-low level of 0.5 per cent well into next year.Japanese inflation is expected to jump higher when the latest data is released on Friday, driven by surging commodity prices.But anxieties over rising prices remain relatively relaxed at the BoJ when compared to concerns recently aired by the ECB and the Federal Reserve. This is because the threat posed to growth from high oil prices is much greater in Japan due to its total dependence on imports.Seiji Nakamura, a BoJ board member, warned yesterday that there would be no change in Japanese monetary policy in the near-term. He said deteriorating economic data continued to weigh on policymaking, leaving the central bank more focused on downside risks to growth than rising price pressures.Mr Mellor says the currency’s plight fits in with the general investment theme of the foreign exchange markets that has emerged recently.“Investors are punishing those currencies whose central banks are unable to take the fight to inflation,” he says.“While the Federal Reserve is blagging its way into the anti-inflation camp alongside the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan is firmly entrenched in the pro-growth camp.”While trading on interest rate differentials may not seem a radical step for currency traders, it marks a departure from the “carry trade” theme that has dominated the yen’s fortunes for much of the last year.The main driving force for the yen until recently was investor risk appetite, with rising equity markets boosting investor confidence and prompting investors to sell the low yielding yen to fund the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets elsewhere.Indeed, the yen rallied strongly as equities tumbled earlier this year, and sold off again as stocks recovered in the wake of the bail-out of Bear Stearns in March.However, that link has been broken in recent weeks, with the yen continuing on its downward path even as global equity markets turned lower.Analysts say this has been prompted by increasing reliance of Japanese investors on foreign bond markets to enhance the low yields on offer domestically.“The relationship between the performance of equities and the yen has broken down,” says Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas.“The yen is no longer being played as a carry trade but is more a relation of Japanese investors increasing their foreign asset exposure as nominal yields rise.”Data from the Japanese Ministry of Finance illustrate the headwinds facing the yen. In May Japanese investors sent a weekly average of Y359.1bn abroad, more than five times more than in May 2007.
713;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-06-25T21:12:31Z;Dollar suffers selling as Fed holds rates;;The dollar suffered a bout of selling late in New York on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold after its policy meeting.The central bank’s decision to leave its main Fed fund’s lending rate unchanged at 2 per cent came as little surprise to investors.However, analysts said it was the accompanying statement that failed to offer the dollar any new direction, largely reflecting the central bank’s recent shift to a more hawkish view on interest rates.Late in New York, the dollar was down 0.7 per cent at $1.5675 against the euro, was 0.3 per cent lower at $1.9755 against the pound and had lost 0.1 per cent to Y107.75 against the yen.Earlier in the session, the euro rose after Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, bolstered expectations he would deliver a rise in eurozone interest rates next month.Mr Trichet told the European Parliament that the central bank was on a “heightened state of alertness” over inflation. He said he was particularly concerned that elevated inflation expectations would lead to second-round effects as workers in the region demanded higher wages.Analysts said his comments echoed the statement following the ECB’s policy meeting earlier this month, when the bank all but guaranteed a 25 basis point rise in eurozone interest rates to 4.25 per cent in July.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said Mr Trichet was making sure that the world knew exactly what was going to happen at the ECB’s July meeting.Furthermore, Mr Derrick said he could not rule out further monetary tightening, possibly as soon as September, given that the ECB maintained it was “closely monitoring” developments.“There is a reasonable chance that the ECB could hike again if eurozone inflation stays at its current elevated levels,” he said.The euro climbed 0.6 per cent to Y168.79 against the yen and gained 0.3 per cent to £0.7923 against the pound.The Norwegian krone rose 0.3 per cent to NKr5.0990 against the dollar and gained 0.1 per cent to NKr7.9560 against the euro after the country’s central bank raised interest rates by 25bp to 5.75 per cent in a bid to stem inflationary pressures in the oil exporter’s overheating economy.The central bank sounded a hawkish note in its accompanying statement, prompting markets to fully price in a further 25bp rate rise. Henrik Gullberg at Calyon said he expected the krone to strengthen: “A hawkish central bank and higher oil prices make it an attractive proposition in the currency universe.”The New Zealand dollar eased 0.2 per cent to $0.7565 against the US dollar after figures showed consumer confidence at its lowest since July 1991.
714;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-06-19T09:58:35Z;Pound surges after sales shock;;Sterling surged on Thursday after a surprise jump in UK retail sales prompted speculation that the economy might be weathering the storm better than thought.Data showed retail sales rose 3.5 per cent in May, the biggest monthly rise for 22 years and far above forecasts for a slight fall. The figures saw expectations for a near-term rise in UK rates jump and pushed sterling higher.Analysts said the data were astounding, especially given the recent gloomy economic forecasts from the Bank of England. The central bank, which faces the prospect of rising inflation and an economic slowdown, warned on Wednesday that the UK economy faced its most “challenging period” since 1997.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said the sales figures shocked currency traders and would not be welcomed by the Bank of England, which earlier this week also warned it could not raise rates to combat inflation for fear of destabilising markets.“The figures look a little suspicious and the Bank will not want to act on just one month’s figures,” he said. “You have to think there will be a rebound to the downside next month given the hurricane-force winds blowing against the UK consumer.”By midday in New York, the pound was up 0.6 per cent to $1.9710 against the dollar, had climbed 0.9 per cent to £0.7862 against the euro and gained 0.6 per cent to Y212.60 against the yen.The Swiss franc lost ground after the Swiss National Bank left rates on hold at 2.75 per cent after its policy meeting. The SNB, which faces pressure to raise rates given inflation hit a 15-year high in May, admitted the decision was a close call, but the central bank said it judged the inflationary trend to be “transitory” and believed price pressures would moderate next year.Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics said given that the SNB did not sound too hawkish and with Swiss economic activity set to slow sharply, he believed the next move in interest rates was most likely to be a cut. “We have pencilled in the first rate cut for next March and see rates falling to as low as 1.5 per by the end of 2009 – much lower than currently priced in by markets.“With the eurozone economy in better shape, the European Central Bank is unlikely to loosen policy quite so aggressively, implying that the Swiss franc could eventually come under downward pressure against the euro.”The Swiss franc fell 0.6 per cent to SFr1.6180 against the euro and fell 0.8 per cent to SFr1.0450 against the dollar.The Canadian dollar rose 0.4 per cent to C$1.0130 against the dollar after Canadian consumer price inflation came in higher than expected in May.The dollar drifted higher, rising 0.2 to $1.5495 against the euro and up 0.1 per cent to Y108.00 against the yen.
715;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-06-02T20:14:34Z;B&B worries hit sterling;;"Sterling fell sharply as news of troubles at Bradford & Bingley, the UK’s largest buy-to-let mortgage lender raised concerns over the health of the economy.Shares in Bradford & Bingley led the UK banking sector lower after the lender issued a stark warning on the state of the UK mortgage market and said profits in the first four months of the year had halved.The financial services sector is an important driver of UK growth. Analysts said the news reminded investors of the problems facing the wider economy.Neil Mellor, at Bank of New York Mellon, said: “The problems Mervyn King [governor of the Bank of England] has been warning about over the UK economy are coming home to roost and a lot of investors believe the slowdown is going to get steeper” .In May Mr King warned that the “nice” decade of strong UK growth and low inflation was over.Mr Mellor said: “Talk of a UK recession is certainly going to grow. I wouldn’t touch sterling at the moment.”By midday in New York the pound was down 0.9 per cent to $1.9650 against the dollar; had dropped 0.6 per cent to £0.7898 against the euro, and lost 1.7 per cent to Y205.50 against the yen.The dollar rose 0.3 per cent to $1.5515 against the euro after the Institute for Supply Management’s survey of the US manufacturing sector in May came in stronger than expected.Win Thin, at Brown Brothers Harriman, said the survey supported data that showed a resilient performance by the US economy in the second quarter.He said this point was underscored by the continuing sell-off in the Fed funds futures market, which in the past week had taken back its expectations of further cuts in US interest rates and was pricing in 50 basis points of monetary tightening by the end of the year.“While we do not agree with this assessment – we think hikes are a 2009 story – it does reflect the shift in market perceptions regarding the US economic outlook and thus the dollar,” he said.The yen advanced as falling European equities heightened risk aversion and boosted demand for the haven of the low-yielding Japanese currency.It rose 0.8 per cent to Y104.65 against the dollar, climbed 1 per cent to Y162.38 against the euro and gained 0.9 per cent to Y99.96 against the Australian dollar.The Australian dollar also lost ground against the US dollar, easing 0.1 per cent to $0.9550, after Australian retail sales came in weaker than expected and registered a surprise fall in April.Analysts said the data would cement expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia would keep interest rates on hold at 7.25 per cent after its policy meeting on Tuesday."
716;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-05-29T11:04:44Z;Australian private equity group buys AST;;American Stock Transfer & Trust Co (AST), the largest independent stock transfer agent in the US, has been sold to an Australian private equity group in a deal worth close to $1bn, including debt.The sale to Pacific Equity Partners (PEP), due to be announced today, will yield a large cash payout to Michael and George Karfunkel, the reclusive and wealthy brothers known in New York for their insurance and commercial property investments.AST provides services for some of the best known names in American business, including Raytheon, Dell, Coca Cola, and Honeywell.The US share registry market is dominated by Computershare, the Australian-listed group, and Bank of New York Mellon.PEP is attempting to build a share registration business with global reach, a service of particular interest to companies with multiple stock exchange listings and those that offer shares to employees in many parts of the world.Link Market Services, PEP’s Australian-based business, has completed a dozen acquisitions in recent years although it failed 12 months ago to secure the UK’s Lloyds TSB Registrars, which was bought by Advent International for £550m.AST also took part in the auction for Lloyds TSB Registrars when it became acquainted with the PEP/Link Market Services team, according to Paul McCullagh, Link Chairman and PEP founder.“The Karfunkels particularly liked the idea of building a global platform,” Mr McCullagh said, adding that Link and ATS between them had close to 4,000 listed companies as clients, second only to Computershare.The Karfunkels founded AST in 1970. Its services include registering the sale and purchase of shares, issuing share certificates, dividend and interest payments, employee share plans, dealing with shareholder inquiries and managing corporate activities such as takeovers, demergers and equity raisings.PEP/Link this month acquired Intime Spectrum, an Indian share registry business with about 850 companies as clients that has also taken part of many of the country’s intial public offerings.The Karfunkel brothers have agreed to re-invest part of their windfall in a newly-capitalised AST, with a stake of about 20 per cent.Silver Lake, the US private equity group that specialises in large technology deals, worked with AST last year on its failed bid for Lloyds TSB. Silver Lake had also shown interest in acquirirng AST.Debt finance for the deal was provided by Goldman Sachs in the US, and National Australia Bank.
717;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-05-28T14:25:18Z;View of the day: Currency intervention;;Rumours of currency market intervention by a variety of Asian central banks are likely to gather pace, says Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.As well as reports that the Bank of Korea had re-entered the market to support the won, Mr Derrick points to talk of currency support action by the central banks of Taiwan, the Philippines and Indonesia.“Comments from a variety of central bank officials indicate that rising inflationary pressures were likely behind these operations,” he says. For example, Vietnam’s annual level of inflation leapt to 25.2 per cent in May from just 7.2 per cent just 12 months ago.The causes of these sharp rises seem relatively understandable given the recent dramatic increases in food and energy costs globally. Hanoi, Mr Derrick points out, estimates that food prices this month jumped 67.8 per cent year-on-year.Adding to the woes of the central banks is the simple fact that the performance of many of these currencies against the dollar has tended to be a mirror image of the latest commodity price moves, he says.“In the absence of a sharp turnaround in commodity prices it seems reasonable to suppose that these currency pressures will only continue to mount.“As such it seems likely that the central banks of the region will continue their support operations as they try to stop the impact of rising commodity prices being exacerbated by sharp local currency losses.”

720;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
721;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-05-09T20:19:40Z;Overview: Record oil dents sentiment;;Oil prices reached yet more record highs on Friday, while concerns over slowing growth and a worsening of credit conditions drove investors to seek havens from risk this week.Crude oil’s spike above $126 a barrel prompted heavy equity selling and left traders in the currency market scratching their heads.Oil prices have, until the past few sessions, tended to move higher as the dollar weakened. But with the dollar broadly flat on the week this correlation has faded, leaving some currency market strategists questioning whether the link was ever particularly strong.“Price movements have gone hand in glove for some time,” said Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon.“But the better leading indicator throughout this time has been with gold as concerns about lower US interest rates and slowing economy have driven investors to safe havens.”Indeed, a flight to safety this week followed the announcement from the US Securities Exchange Commission on Wednesday that it was scrutinising investment banks and would urge more transparent disclosure from securities companies.“While this will eventually result in more transparent and robust balance sheets, the current effect is likely to make matters worse before they get better,” said Charles Diebel, at Nomura.Credit markets in Europe had their worst week in nearly six months because of concerns of a return to the tumultuous conditions last seen in the first quarter.ING said data from a survey of Senior Loans Officers suggested second-round effects of the credit crunch would result in a sharp rise in corporate defaults.“The prognosis for both the economy and markets is still looking negative,” said ING economist, Rob Carnell.The cost of insuring European corporate bonds from default rose sharply over the week, having fallen to four-month lows last week. The iTraxx Europe index of investment grade debt, rose 13.75 basis points to 78.75. The iTraxx Crossover index of junk status bonds rose 45bp to 457. The CDX North America investment grade index rose by its biggest weekly amount in three months.The heightened aversion to risk helped lift government bonds and drove yields lower.The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell 8.4bp to 3.77 per cent, while the two-year note yield fell 2.3bp to 2.21 per cent.The deepening economic gloom in the UK left the yield on the 10-year Gilt 15bp lower at 4.59 per cent, while the two-year yield fell 20.9bp to 4.29 per cent.In the eurozone, the benchmark 10-year Bund yield fell 16bp to 4.58 per cent.The dollar was a little weaker against the euro by the end of the week, but the US currency remained stronger against most other crosses. The biggest moves on currency markets this week were from the yen, as the Japanese currency was sought as a haven from volatility.It rose 3.8 per cent against the high-yielding New Zealand dollar and climbed 3.3 per cent against sterling.Sterling was undermined by expectations of a 25bp June interest rate cut to 4.75 per cent after the Bank of England held its fire at Thursday’s monetary policy meeting.A more dovish tone from the European Central Bank put any lingering thoughts of possible rate increases in the eurozone firmly off the agenda.It kept the main refinancing rate in the eurozone at 4 per cent, but acknowledged the risk of soft economic data in recent weeks.The euro fell nearly 2 per cent against the yen, but climbed 1.4 per cent against the weak pound.Equity markets were driven lower by heightened risk aversion and a flight from financial stocks after US insurer AIG revealed $15bn in credit-related writedowns and said it planned to raise $12.5bn to help fill the gap on its balance sheet.Swiss bank UBS had another poor week as one of its top bankers was questioned by US tax officials. UBS fell 11.6 per cent over the week, leading a sell off in the European banking sector and leaving the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 1.4 per cent lower on the week.The SEC’s announcement on Wednesday fuelled a sell off on Wall Street. The S&P 500 was down 1.9 per cent over the week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.3 per cent.Asian markets also fell. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo lost 1.4 per cent.Oil was the main mover on commodity markets. Nymex West Texas Intermediate made a weekly gain of 8.5 per cent to a record $126.20 a barrel after Opec, the producer cartel, reiterated its belief that the global market was well supplied. The contract settled at $125.96.Gold rose 2.5 per cent over the week to $877.10 a troy ounce.Rising bulk commodity prices drove the price of shipping goods higher. The Baltic Dry index, a composite index of shipping prices, breached 10,000 points, rising 6.8 per cent over the week to 10,237. A year ago the index stood at 6,478.
722;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-05-02T17:02:25Z;Tide begins to turn for dollar;;The dollar, so long the whipping boy of the foreign exchange markets, has started to fight back.Pushed to a record low against the euro only last week, the US currency has recovered sharply, triggering speculation that its seven-year downtrend might be coming to an end.This week’s signal from the Federal Reserve that it had paused in its interest rate-cutting cycle was the driving force behind the dollar’s renaissance.But analysts say rising US equity markets and improving US economic data also gave the dollar a lift.“This combination has been unambiguously positive for the dollar, but for now we are just enjoying the moment and pushing it higher,” says Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon.“But if we get confirmation that these three factors are the start of a trend, then the dollar has put in a bottom here.”The dollar suffered as the Federal Reserve embarked on its aggressive interest rate-cutting policy last summer, slashing its main rate by 3.25 percentage points to 2 per cent.This attempt by the US authorities to bolster growth in the face of the credit crisis sent the dollar down to a series of record lows against a raft of currencies.However, as the fallout from the subprime crisis spilled out across the world, domestic economic data in other countries began to deteriorate.The UK and Canada were the first to feel the effects, pushing the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada into their own rate-cutting campaigns.This prompted a rebound in the dollar from a 26-year low against the pound and a record trough against the Canadian dollar.Now, just as the Fed has signalled it may pause its interest rate-cutting cycle, there are signs that economic conditions in the eurozone are starting to crumble. This could eventually prompt the European Central Bank to abandon its hawkish stance and start cutting interest rates.This, analysts say, could trigger a rebound in the dollar against the euro. The greenback has hit a series of record lows this year and dropped more than 60 per cent against the single currency since 2001.Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas says weak eurozone retail sales and activity data imply domestic demand in the eurozone has weakened while export growth is easing.“Exports cannot now act as the one and only pillar of eurozone economic growth support as demand slows down globally,” he says. “Within this context, the euro looks drastically overvalued.”Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman says he has long argued that the dollar has already bottomed against the pound and the Canadian dollar and has been carving out a bottom against the euro.He says the pieces of the puzzle that need to fall into place for a dollar upturn against the euro include a narrowing of growth differentials in favour of the dollar and a shift in monetary policies in favour of the dollar.“The monetary policy shift appears to be beginning and that has already provided dollar support,” says Mr Chandler. “The Fed’s ability to remain on hold in coming months will depend on whether the US economy begins to gain some traction in the second half of the year.”Other factors are also supporting the dollar.A growing feeling that the worst of the credit crisis might be over has fuelled risk appetite, drastically reducing demand for the haven of the low-yielding yen.Indeed, the yen has fallen sharply in recent weeks, dropping more than 7 per cent from the 13-year high it hit against the dollar in March.Mr Woolfolk says markets tend to turn a blind eye to unfavourable news if they feel the worst-case scenario has already been accounted for. “Recent signs of immunity to unfavourable banking-related news suggest this point has been reached,” he says.Meanwhile, China’s decision to let the renminbi strengthen faster has also supported the dollar. Although this reduces the country’s accumulation of dollar reserves, it also reduces the need for China to diversify its holdings away from the dollar in order to balance the proportion of currencies within its holdings.The diversification of global central banks’ $6,000bn of reserves away from the dollar has been a drag on the currency in recent years.However, Mansoor Mohi-uddin at UBS says it is the activity of American asset managers, who have $27,000bn under their control, that matter most for the currency markets.He says signs that US investors have stopped diversifying away from the dollar could support the currency further.From 2003 to 2007, US mutual funds increased the proportion of foreign assets in their portfolios from under 15 per cent to 25 per cent. However, since the credit crisis intensified in October, the rising share of foreign assets has come to a halt.“With the US equity market outperforming European markets this year for the first time in six years, Americans’ dollar diversification may be peaking,” he says.
723;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-04-29T14:40:08Z;View of the day: Gold’s relationship with the euro;;"The close relationship between the performance of gold and the euro since late 2005 means the weakness of the metal could prove significant, says Simon Derrick, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He says the rally in gold that began last September was because
of concerns about the inflationary impact of the Federal Reserve entering an aggressive easing cycle and the desire to hold safe-haven assets.He adds that with the European Central Bank’s hawkish stance and the view that the eurozone economy was less exposed to the impact of the credit crisis than the US, it is easy to see why the euro started to perform in a similar fashion to gold.But he says there has been a steady improvement in confidence since the crisis – and the gold price – hit its peak on March 17, as well as a perception that the US easing cycle is coming to an end.“In other words, there appears to be a very specific reversal in the factors that drove gold to its record peak a month and a half ago. Following the recent failure of the price to break back above $950, there is a growing danger that gold could actually be about to enter into a well-defined downtrend.“Given how closely the euro has tracked the gold price in recent years and with the economic outlook for the eurozone clearly deteriorating, there is an increasing risk of a significant sell-off developing in euro/dollar from here.”"
724;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Overview: European markets nervous but US and Asia rally;;"Another big writedown from a European bank, further evidence of the dire state of the US housing sector and an unsettling drop in German business confidence set the scene for another nervous session in the markets on Thursday.However, US equity investors managed to put their concerns to one side and push Wall Street higher for a second day as beaten-down financial stocks attracted buyers.“Clearly, investors remain in two minds as to whether or not the worst of the credit crisis – and its impact on real economic activity – has now been accounted for,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.The day got off to a grim start as Credit Suisse reported its first loss for almost five years after taking credit-related writedowns of $5.2bn.That initially helped send European equity markets sharply lower, although the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index finally settled 0.2 per cent higher as investors took their cue from Wall Street’s gains.Late in New York, the S&P 500 index had closed up 0.6 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent.In Asia, China grabbed the headlines as the Shanghai Composite index jumped more than 9 per cent.While this helped push Hong Kong to a fresh three-month high, the rest of the region’s stock markets eased back with the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo slipping 0.3 per cent, Sydney 1.2 per cent and Singapore 0.5 per cent.Thursday’s US data releases painted a somewhat mixed picture of the economy.New home sales slumped by 8.5 per cent last month to an annual rate of 526,000, the lowest since October 1991. The median price of a new home was down 13.3 per cent from a year earlier. “This leaves no other conclusion than that the downturn in the US housing market is still in full swing,” said Dimitry Fleming, of ING. “For sales to recover, mortgages rates need to come down considerably, consumer confidence has to be restored and prices will have to start falling less rapidly. We do not see this happening anytime soon.”On a more positive note, however, US initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell by 33,000 last week while ex-transportation durable goods orders increased by 1.5 per cent in March.But there was little in the day’s European economic reports for investors to cheer.Germany’s Ifo economic institute said its business climate index fell from 104.8 in February to 102.4 last month, the lowest level since January 2006 and a bigger drop than had been expected.Meanwhile, French business confidence dropped to its lowest since December 2006 and, in the UK, the CBI employers’ group released a gloomy industrial trends survey. UK retail sales fell at their fastest pace in more than a year during March, although there were hefty upward revisions to the previous two months’ figures.US government bonds were shunned as data further dented expectations of that aggressive US interest rate cuts might still be on the cards. A poorly received $19bn sale of five-year notes also hit sentiment.The yield on the two-year Treasury bond was up 17 basis points at 2.39 per cent while the 10-year yield was 10bp higher at 3.83 per cent.Drew Matus, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said that, while the Federal Reserve was likely to cut rates at a slower pace, the easing cycle in the US was far from over.“The Fed’s aggressive policies seem to be working; the money market is under less stress and about half of the credit spread widening in the first part of the year reversed,” he said. “However, signs of collateral damage to the economy have grown and will likely continue to grow.”In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield rose 5bp to 4.20 per cent although the rate-sensitive two-year Schatz yield ended flat at 3.92 per cent.On the currency markets, the Ifo survey helped the dollar continue its rebound from Tuesday’s record low against the euro. The US unit also got support from the shift in what the market is expecting from the Fed.In commodities, oil prices fell back as the dollar continued to recover and investors took profits on this week’s strong rally.Gold fell back below the $900-an-ounce level to touch a three-week low."
725;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-04-10T19:05:46Z;Euro powers on after ECB holds rates;;The euro hit record highs against the dollar and the pound Thursday as the European Central Bank gave no signal that eurozone interest rates were headed lower.The ECB, as widely forecast, kept rates on hold at 4 per cent after its policy meeting and reiterated its concerns over rising inflationary pressures.“The notable rise of the inflation rate and the resulting risk of second-round effects are currently making rate cuts impossible, in particular as eurozone economic data – above all from Germany – remains relatively robust,” said Gavin Friend at Commerzbank.The euro touched a record high of $1.5912 against the dollar and an all-time peak of £0.8029 against the pound.However, the single currency pared its gains after Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, said he deplored the recent “excess volatility” in exchange rate moves.By midday in New York, the euro stood flat at $1.5825 and was 0.3 per cent lower at £0.7991.The euro also fell 1.2 per cent to Y159.20 against the yen as weakness in global equity markets pushed investors towards the haven of the low-yielding Japanese currency.Analysts said the decision from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to revalue its currency had also boosted the yen.The Singapore dollar hit a record high of S$1.3555 to the US dollar after the city-state tightened its monetary policy in response to an unexpected jump in first-quarter economic growth that raised inflation fears.“While there is no direct link between strength in the Singapore dollar and the yen, traders’ knee-jerk reaction was to send other Asian currencies higher,” said Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon.The Chinese renminbi also broke through the Rmb7 level against the dollar, rising to Rmb6.9920, its highest level since it was de-pegged from the US currency and revalued in 2005.However, Mr Derrick said he believed rising risk aversion would be the main driver of yen strength in the longer term.Indeed, as European equities weakened, the yen rose 1.2 per cent to Y100.59 against the dollar and gained 0.8 per cent to Y199.25 against sterling.The low-yielding Swiss franc also received a boost, gaining 0.6 per cent to SFr0.9955 against the dollar.The pound was 0.3 per cent stronger at 1.9800 against the dollar, showing limited reaction to the Bank of England’s widely expected decision to cut UK interest rates by 25 basis points to 5 per cent following its Monetary Policy Committee meeting.The move followed a recent string of worsening UK economic data, which heightened fears that the effects of the credit crisis were spilling over into the real economy.
726;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-04-08T20:42:02Z;Wall St falls as results season starts;;US stocks ended a three session winning streak on Tuesday, falling after Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season with a downbeat set of results and Washington Mutual said it had secured a $7bn capital infusion to shore up its capital base.The largest savings and loan company in the US sold shares, at a sizeable discount, to a group of investors including TPG, the private equity firm, and said it would use the proceeds to keep its capital ratios well above required levels.The company also said it expected to report far bigger first-quarter losses than had been expected, would dramatically increase its provisions for bad loans and slash its dividend and 3,000 jobs for good measure.Washington Mutual shares, which jumped almost 30 per cent on Monday on speculation about the deal, fell back sharply on the news. The shares dropped 10.2 per cent to $11.81.That, and a striking report from the International Monetary Fund arguing that financial losses from the US mortgage crisis could hit about $1,000bn, dragged financials lower.The S&P 500 Financials index fell 1.7 per cent, led by Citigroup, which fell 3.4 per cent to $23.76, and Federated Investors, which slid 6.9 per cent to $34.80, hit by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs analysts.The IMF report undercut nascent optimism about the downtrodden sector. Earlier in the day, analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded brokers and asset managers from “neutral” to “attractive”, arguing that mortgage writedowns might “significantly exceed” actual losses.Goldman reiterated its recommendation to “buy” Lehman Brothers shares and upgraded Franklin Resources, Bank of New York Mellon, MetLife, American Express, and Janus Capital.Lehman Brothers fell 2.1 per cent to $43.67 while Bank of New York dropped 0.9 per cent to $42.98 and American Express slipped 0.2 per cent to $46.47.Still, investors found enough resilience to absorb the gloomy minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee which showed some officials were concerned about “a prolonged and severe economic downturn,” as they cut interest rates last month.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said: “The quite negative view of the economic outlook…seems likely, in our view, to trump inflation as a concern and bolsters our view of a 50 basis point rate cut at the end of the month.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,365.54 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,348.76.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3 per cent to 12,576.44.After the close on Monday, Alcoa reported declines in both sales and profits for the first quarter as the company was hit by slowing demand in its home market and rising energy and raw materials costs.The stock slipped a further 0.7 per cent to $37.18, adding to Monday’s 4 per cent decline.Industrial conglomerates also came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut their profit estimates and target prices for the sector, arguing that orderswould fall as the economy weakened.Morgan Stanley analysts cut their 2009 profit forecasts for 16 companies, including General Electric, Emerson Electric and Honeywell, reduced their industry rating to “cautious” and encouraged investors to take profits ahead of potentially disappointing earnings towards the end of 2008.GE fell 0.8 per cent to $36.95 while Emerson dropped 2.4 per cent to $52.10 and Honeywell lost 1.6 per cent to $57.19.A sales warning overnight from AMD, the second largest microprocessor maker, also weighed on the market.The company said it would cut about 10 per cent of its workforce in response but AMD shares fell 4.9 per cent to $6.03.Elsewhere in the sector, Intel dropped 3.1 per cent to $21.08 while Novellus lost 8. per cent to $21.88.Homebuilders fell back after the latest data showed pending home sales fell more than expected in February.Lennar dropped 8.3 per cent to $20 and Pulte Homes lost 5.8 per cent to $14.94.Energy stocks helped cushion falls. Coal companies, Consol Energy and Peabody Energy climbed 4.9 per cent to $78.21 and 5.1 per cent to $59.92 respectively.
727;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-04-06T18:55:25Z;Riches on offer, but hard to get;;"It is always the numbers, the sheer scale of the place that makes China so awesome.For asset managers, the numbers to take your breath away include the rate of growth of assets in the fund management industry: 282 per cent in 2007 to Rmb3,200bn (£231bn, €292bn, $456bn). Half of this growth is due to new investment in funds, and half to the spectacular growth of the stock market.Thus, in spite of the formidable challenges, western asset managers are drawn to China, certain that it will one day be the world’s largest market and determined to be established there before this is the case.The first obstacle entrants run up against is a regulatory one. Foreign-owned companies can only operate in China via a joint venture with a Chinese company, and cannot own more than 49 per cent of that venture.Another possible entry point is as a subadviser, particularly to an asset manager that has a licence as a qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII), which allows it to raise funds in China to invest abroad. Going the other direction is the qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) licence, which allows a company to invest money raised overseas in the Chinese market. A lucky few companies will also win mandates from China’s enormous institutional investors.Most entrants choose one route or another, but Bank of New York Mellon has gone for the blanket approach. The American company has traditionally had a very dispersed asset management business, with each unit having an impressive degree of autonomy. This means it is not intimidated by the complexity of a multiple approach.“This is a dynamic market,” says David Jiang, chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon in China. “It’s going to change, there’s going to be some businesses that won’t work as well as others.” With a QDII subadvisory deal, a joint venture due to launch its first product this year and an application for a QFII licence in the pipeline, BNY Mellon is clearly hoping that, whichever model comes out the champion, it will have been in from the beginning.With this broad approach to the market, Mr Jiang is in a good position to give an overview of the challenges for foreign entrants.“The most important thing is attracting and retaining the top talent,” he says. “Number two is localisation”, making sure that the product conforms not only to local regulatory requirements but also to local market demands. “The third challenge is the speed of change. We need to adapt very quickly.”Another American firm, T Rowe Price, is also intent on making its mark in China, although it has rejected the joint venture option in favour of a subadvisory licence with China Asset Management Company and a mandate from
the National Council for Social Security.“Lots of joint ventures are having difficulties,” says Todd Ruppert, chief executive of T Rowe Price Global Investment Services. “These are mostly growing pains of dealing with China, as well as a failure of perspective in going into the joint venture.” In Mr Ruppert’s view, a joint venture requires both parents to have the same reasons for going into business together, and the danger is that one or both of them will find their needs changing over time. “In China, another factor is the European perspective. You need to understand the hierarchical structure, how things are done and who is really in charge.”By choosing not to go down the joint venture road, T Rowe Price has also avoided one of the greatest challenges of the Chinese market: dealing with Chinese investors. As is the case across most of Asia, Chinese investors tend to treat mutual funds like stocks, holding them for very short periods by American or European standards.“The education level of the investor is such that they are short-term investors,” says Mr Ruppert. “We were hired to provide advice on how to manage money.” It is hard not to hear a tone of relief in his voice.Denis Lefranc, chief executive of Fortune SGAM, Société Générale’s asset management joint venture in China, agrees that investor education is a major issue.“It’s a tough market because you have a real issue in terms of investor education,” he comments. “Retail investors are very volatile.” He is not daunted, however. Having been in China for four years, he has seen a great deal of progress in this direction, albeit with occasional backsliding as investors are swept away in the excitement of soaring markets. Managing $9.53bn for Chinese investors, Fortune SGAM is one of the oldest asset management joint ventures in China.The QDII field has got more crowded since Mr Lefranc oversaw the establishment of Fortune SGAM in 2003. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has issued 14 QDII licences, although just six QDII products have been launched. Shanghai-based consultant Z-Ben predicts more than 10 will be launched in 2008.The signs are that the environment will be more challenging. Mr Lefranc remembers the good old days; with a joint venture established in March 2003, and a fund launched by the end of that year, Fortune SGAM was profitable by the end of 2004.“Now the market is more competitive, but it’s still possible to build a profitable business within a reasonable amount of time.”"
728;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-04-06T18:48:04Z;Opportunities about for those willing first-movers;;Latin America is looking increasingly attractive to global investment managers, as loosening regulatory restrictions in key markets open a rapidly growing asset base to firms with an international product set.Cross-border allocations from local mutual funds and pensions to foreign-based managers will reach $305bn (£154bn, €195bn) by 2011, or 15 per cent of the projected $2,000bn in assets under management, says research firm Cerulli Associates.That would represent a six-fold increase from the more than $53bn at present managed by firms based outside Latin America. Pension funds will contribute two-thirds of cross-border assets, Cerulli says, with regional mutual funds accounting for one-third of allocations.Political stability, a commodities boom and declining interest rates have significantly boosted asset levels in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Peru, observers say. Most countries, especially Chile, have responded by lifting restrictions on investing those assets abroad.Observers say local investors are most interested in traditional international products but may also develop a taste for alternative investments. Mexico will soon allow private pensions to invest 30 per cent of their portfolios in local and foreign equities, up from 15 per cent.Whether that translates to inflows for managers with operations in the region is “very hard to predict,” says Mercer Investment Consulting senior associate Yosangel Haddad, pointing out that many of the promised regulatory changes “may take a long time to materialise”. But newly formed sovereign wealth funds, as in Chile, may provide an additional source of institutional assets, Mr Haddad says.The region is still overlooked, creating opportunity for first-movers, says Javier Guerra, of Bulltick Capital Markets, an investment bank focused exclusively on Latin America.Spanish financial services giants BBVA and Santander have led a tight consolidation of the banking sector. But Mr Guerra sees plenty of opportunity for global managers to gain access by buying into local shops. Some major players have expanded through acquisitions. UBS acquired the prominent Brazilian investment bank Banco Pactual in late 2006. In January, New York-based manager BNY Mellon completed its acquisition of Arx Capital Management, a Rio de Janeiro-based investment firm with $2.8bn in assets under management, mostly in Brazil. Arx has strengthened BNY Mellon’s position with local clients, while opening up a new source of Brazilian investment opportunities for investors in the USZeca Oliveira, country head of BNY Mellon Brazil, says the firm is still integrating Arx but expects to focus its distribution on pensions, insurance companies and wealthy private investors in Brazil and Mexico. In Brazil, declining interest rates have combined with a growing demand for higher returns to boost the cachet of foreign-based firms, he says.A global slowdown may dull that effect in the short-term. Brazilian investors have responded to recent market volatility with a “flight to safety,” says Mr Oliveira. “I think this year will be difficult for the fund industry in Brazil, but I’m thinking for the mid-term, the long-term, that’s a wonderful market to be in.”The eVestment Alliance manager database shows 10 global firms with more than $1bn in accounts domiciled in Latin America. ING Investment Management leads the pack with $45.6bn in client assets in the region, followed by UBS Global Asset Management with $36bn and Barclays Global Investors with $28.2bn, as of December 31 2007. JPMorgan Asset Management is not far behind, with roughly $20bn.Brazil had the largest pension market in 2006, with $119bn in assets, followed by Chile with $89bn, Mexico with $66bn, Argentina with $29bn, Colombia with $24bn and Peru with $14bn, according to Cerulli.The retail space is much more heavily concentrated in Brazil, which led the region with $392bn in mutual fund assets in 2006.Most of those assets have traditionally been invested domestically. Chile had $89bn in mutual fund assets in 2006, and Mexico had $66bn.Political stability in the region could prove a double-edged sword for global managers. As Latin Americans look to invest the bulk of their assets in strong local markets, demand for overseas investment will wane at the same time as more firms enter the region.“It would be very hard to convince a Mexican or a Brazilian to invest in US equities,” says Alberto Franco, managing partner of Bulltick’s alternative investment arm, Quantek Asset Management. “The world is upside down. Right now, the flight to quality is out of the US and into Latin America.”That shift has raised the profile of competitive domestic managers with local expertise. Global firms that did not stick out the most recent banking crisis in the region in 2001 will need to find local partners. “The best bet is always to do joint ventures and team up, or to buy pieces of Latin American banks and investment banks,” says Mr Franco.Scott Johnson is a reporter on Fundfire, an FT publication
729;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-04-03T00:48:28Z;Money market managers waive fees;;More money market fund managers have begun waiving their fees or planning to do so in a bid to protect investors’ money from being eroded by sharply dropping interest rates.Fidelity, the biggest money market fund manager with $400bn, said on Wednesday it had waived or reimbursed fees to investors in some institutional funds.Federated Investments, another big money market manager, also suspended some fees for a period last month, the company told analysts last week.Wachovia’s Evergreen and Bank of New York Mellon’s Dreyfus unit have previously said they have waived fees.Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for Fidelity, said: “We closely monitor yields, and if they approach zero then we look at waiving the fees …we understand that investors have some expectation of a return.”She said some share classes in institutional funds had had fee waivers, but no such action had been taken on any retail funds, most of which had very low fees already. Fidelity had filed a prospectus amendment with the Securities and Exchange Commission to announce that it might waive fees in order to avoid a negative yield for investors, she said.However, Ms Crowley said that the issue was not related to “breaking the buck” – whereby investors’ money falls below the value of the $1 a share invested – because as yields fell, the value of the funds’ underlying securities rose.Money fund managers are under growing pressure to maintain investors’ returns as interest rates drop sharply. In some cases, yields barely cover the management fees, which is why fund companies are taking action.At the same time, record amounts of money are pouring into the funds. In the week to Wednesday, investors had pulled a small amount of money from the funds, for the first time in some weeks, leaving total assets still at a near-record of $3,440bn.The funds are not guaranteed but are viewed as being almost as secure as bank accounts, and fund marketers have shown they are willing to go to some lengths to prop up the funds and take any loss themselves, rather than allow investors to lose money.
730;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-04-02T15:56:17Z;View of the day: Sentiment improves;;Investor sentiment towards the global financial sector appears to have stabilised in the past month, says Simon Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He says: “In recent months, there would appear to have been a significant slowdown in the pace of outflows of international investment from financial sector stocks in the eurozone, UK, Japan and Switzerland.”“Indeed, since early March, these outflows have all but dried up.”This trend is remarkable given that it has occurred in a period marked by the dramatic loss of confidence in Bear Stearns and its subsequent rescue by JPMorgan Chase.It also contrasts with the negative reaction of international investors towards financials as the subprime crisis and the credit crunch began to take hold in earnest last year.“At the very least, such a divergence between the price action and the pattern of flows indicates that investor sentiment is genuinely stabilising in this sector,” says Mr Derrick.He adds that this is part of a wider trend of reversals in currency and commodity markets, such as in the euro/dollar exchange rate.He says the positive sentiment about the financial sector “provides us with another small piece of evidence that the apparent trend reversals being seen in a wide range of markets and currency pairs might prove sustainable”.
731;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-03-27T20:55:17Z;Gloom prevails in spite of rallying dollar;;The dollar enjoyed some respite against the euro Thursday, reversing two days of sharp losses as the onset of the end of the first quarter triggered demand for the US currency.A series of weak US economic data – including a surprise drop in retail sales and sliding consumer confidence – increased the gloom surrounding the US economy and weighed on the dollar earlier in the week.In contrast, data from the eurozone – such as Wednesday’s unexpected rise in German business confidence – gave the euro a boost as it suggested the region could better weather the fallout from the credit crisis than the US. However, after approaching its record low of $1.5904 against the euro in Asian trade Thursday, the dollar recovered sharply as traders reported demand for the greenback as US investors repatriated funds ahead of the end of the quarter.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said: “With euro/dollar once again threatening to chalk up another previously inconceivable level around $1.60, it is certainly possible that many investors are losing their appetites for the concerted push to send the single currency higher against the greenback.”By midday in New York, the dollar rose 0.4 per cent to $1.5785 against the euro, climbed 0.9 per cent to Y99.83 against the yen and gained 0.5 per cent to SFr0.9940 against the Swiss franc. The dollar eased 0.1 per cent to $2.0100 against the pound, however, as sterling recovered from a sharp sell-off on Wednesday following comments from the Bank of England that boosted expectations for a near-term cut in UK interest rates.Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman said there was a feeling in the market that sterling’s fall had been overdone, while data showing higher-than-expected UK investment spending in the third quarter had also given the pound a boost.But he said the pound’s gains might not be sustainable: “With market expectations of a Bank of England rate cut next month, sterling remains vulnerable.” The pound also rose 0.4 per cent to £0.7855 against the euro and gained 0.8 per cent to Y200.50 against the yen.Elsewhere, the South African rand rose 0.9 per cent to a one-week high of R7.9770 against the dollar after a larger-than-expected rise in producer price inflation heightened expectations that the South African Reserve Bank would raise interest rates after its policy meeting next month.Meanwhile, the renminbi closed in on the psychologically important Rmb7 level against the dollar as the Chinese authorities continued to allow the currency to appreciate in a bid to stem inflation. The renminbi rose 0.3 per cent to Rmb7.0105 against the dollar, its strongest level since it was re-valued and de-pegged from the greenback in July 2005.
732;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-03-18T18:54:37Z;Sterling falls victim to market stresses;;Sterling has joined the dollar as one of the biggest casualties of the credit crisis.The pound recovered some ground on Tuesday when global equities showed signs of stability, after global equity markets tumbled following the rescue of Bear Stearns, the US investment bank. The came after it on Monday experienced its biggest one-day fall since its ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992.The pound dropped to a record low of £0.7912 against the euro and plunged nearly two cents against the dollar. On a trade-weighted basis, the pound fell nearly 2 per cent, taking it to its weakest level since January 1997.Analysts said worries over the health of the global financial sector and the resulting weakness in UK financial stocks were the catalyst for the move and that the currency was likely to continue to come under pressure.Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas, said: “Sterling is likely to feel the full force of the stress in financial markets given UK economy’s exposure to the financial sector.”Concerns over the UK financial sector have been weighing heavily on the pound in recent months. Sterling has fallen more than 4 per cent against the dollar since it hit a 26-year peak above $2.10 last November, lost more than 12 per cent against the euro, and tumbled nearly 18 per cent against the yen.Markets expect the Bank of England to deliver interest rate cuts of 100 basis points by the end of the year to stave off the effects of the credit crisis.A close relationship has developed between the outlook for the UK financial sector and the performance of the pound, particularly against the euro.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said it was significant that the start of the pound’s aggressive downward trend against the euro started on September 13, the day it became clear that the Bank of England had been providing emergency funding to Northern Rock, the recently nationalised mortgage lender.Mr Derrick said there had been a 90 per cent correlation between the performance of the pound against the euro and the persistent outflows of foreign capital from UK equities as monitored by the Bank of New York Mellon.
733;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Treasury trading remains congested;;A distinct lack of trading support from banks for many markets remained evident on Monday as traders digested the latest liquidity provision from the Federal Reserve.While the news that the Fed will now allow all primary dealers access to its discount window is welcome, dealers say the process of restoring confidence and a regular trading environment will take time.Conditions in the Treasury debt market, which has been eagerly sought as a safe haven in the current period of extreme market stress, are relatively constrained say dealers.“Liquidity is better than what we saw on Friday, but there is still a lot less than normal in size being traded,” said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co.“I would be nervous to do a big trade in Treasuries at the moment,” he said, adding there is no real market in off-the-run or older issued Treasuries.Because the Treasuries market is the bedrock for trading other areas of fixed income, the limited activity in the sector means there is little sign of normal levels of liquidity infusing the trading of mortgages, corporate bonds, swaps and other derivatives.Trading sizes are much smaller than normal and the difference between the bid and offer prices for many debt instruments is much wider than usual or simply non-existent.Liquidity in currencies was also impaired and there were drops in some commodity prices early on Monday as the use of leverage, or trades funded through borrowing, were cut.“One noticeable aspect of trading today [on Monday] even in mainstream currency pairs has been a marked decline in the depth of the market,” said Bank of New York Mellon.
734;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-03-12T20:36:52Z;Overview: Caution on Fed move stymies equity rally;;"Investors turned cautious on Wednesday amid concerns that Federal Reserve-led plans to boost financial market liquidity might prove insufficient to ease the stress in the credit markets.Meanwhile, the dollar plumbed fresh lows against the euro and a basket of currencies as oil broke above $110 a barrel, a new record. Crude has risen rapidly since it broke through $100 in early January.Analysts reacted cautiously to the Fed’s move.“Ultimately, whether this action by the Fed and its cohorts will prove sufficient to thaw the eight-month freeze in credit markets remains to be seen; but it must be said that a
brief glance across financial markets as a whole reveals, at best, a far more cautious reaction than that of equity markets,” said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.For example, a rally for the dollar quickly fizzled out as the market appeared to take the view that the central bank moves did not negate the need for further US interest rate cuts.Julian Jessop at Capital Economics said: “If anything, the Fed’s readiness to pull out all the stops simply underlines the fact that it is unwilling to take any risks with confidence either in the financial system or the real economy, especially with the latter now almost certainly in recession,” he said.Interest rate futures were pricing in a 72 per cent chance of a 75 basis points cut in the Fed funds rate to 2.25 per cent at next week’s meeting of the US central bank.Signs of stress remained in the money markets as three-month euro and sterling interbank rates edged higher in spite of the co-ordinated central bank action.Credit spreads followed the mixed tone set by stocks on either side of the Atlantic. While the investment-grade iTraxx Europe index dipped below 150bp, the CDX North America index was 3.5bp wider at 181.5bp late in New York. The iTraxx Crossover of mostly junk-rated credits eased back below 600bp.Equity markets were mixed and financials spurned an early rally in New York. The S&P 500 closed 0.9 per cent lower after enjoying its best one-day advance for five years on Tuesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.4 per cent.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.2 per cent and the FTSE 100 gained 1.5 per cent.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 1.6 per cent, Hong Kong climbed 1.9 per cent and the Australian market jumped 2.4 per cent.The US government bond market rebounded as uncertainty about the latest Fed moves set in. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 14bp to 3.45 per cent while the two-year yield was 13bp lower at 1.61 per cent.“While it is clear the latest tranche of co-ordinated central bank liquidity injection has had a cathartic reaction in the markets, it should be remembered there is still a long way to go before the all-clear is sounded,” said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns.“The latest move is no final panacea and there is still probably more to play out.”However, gilts fell sharply, particularly at the short-end, as the UK Treasury announced that 2008-09 supply would total £80bn, much more than expected. The yield on two-year paper shot up 17bp to 3.96 per cent while the 10-year yield rose 6bp to 4.41 per cent.In Europe, the two-year Schatz yield rose 2bp to 3.34 per cent as robust eurozone industrial production data further damped talk of a near-term interest rate cut by the European Central Bank.On the currency markets, the data also offered support to the euro as it climbed to a fresh record high against the dollar above $1.55.Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, sounded the alarm again on the euro’s strength on Wednesday, warning that “in present circumstances, we are concerned about excessive moves on the exchange market”.The dollar also retreated against the yen and sterling.In commodities, the oil price continued to rise in spite of weekly US data showing a much bigger than expected increase in crude inventories. April West Texas Intermediate hit a record $110.20 a barrel, helped by the weak dollar.Gold also got a boost from the dollar but failed to retest its recent record of $991.90. Agricultural commodity prices also continued to forge ahead."
735;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-03-11T22:29:48Z;Traders forced to scale back dollar bets;;The dollar rallied after the Federal Reserve announced co-ordinated efforts to boost liquidity.Analysts said news that the Fed, along with other leading global central banks, would act to ease strains in the global financial system forced currency traders to scale back bets against the dollar.Earlier in the session the dollar had sunk more than 1 per cent against the euro to a record low of $1.5495 after a survey of German economic confidence was much stronger than expected.Analysts said the data suggested the eurozone was proving resilient in the face of a deteriorating outlook for the US and problems in financial markets.However, news of the co-ordinated central bank action sparked a violent reaction in the currency markets, pulling the dollar back to $1.5322 against the euro late in New York, down 0.1 per cent.Alan Ruskin at RBS Greenwich Capital said he suspected the dollar had rallied on the news because it caught the market short of the greenback, forcing investors to buy the dollar aggressively.He said.“The economic rationale for buying dollars is that it encourages confidence in the US financial system, but earlier the market was buying risk and selling the dollar on exactly the same logic.“The squaring story is the best explanation then for what has happened, and is probably not a great basis for a sustained dollar revival.”Analysts said the dollar also benefited as the Fed’s announcement quelled talk that the central bank would announce an emergency cut in interest rates ahead of its policy meeting next week.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said speculation that the Fed might be forced into such a move had been circulating since late last week.He said “It could be argued that this talk had become so pervasive that there was a growing danger that if they did nothing prior to next week’s meeting then a fresh sell-off in asset markets could have emerged”.The dollar rose 1.3 per cent to SFr1.0330 against the Swiss franc, climbed 1.5 per cent to Y103.30 against the yen and, against the pound, gained 0.2 per cent to $2.0050.Elsewhere, rising risk appetite saw the low-yielding yen extend its losses.Analysts said a rally in Asian equity markets had already given investors an excuse to take some profits on long positions in the yen and the Fed’s announcement simply added impetus to the move.The yen fell 1.4 per cent to Y158.40 against the euro, dropped 1.3 per cent to Y207.10 against the pound, fell 2.4 per cent to Y95.55 against the Australian dollar and dropped 3.1 per cent to Y82.80 against the New Zealand dollar.
736;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-03-07T19:29:30Z;Surprise fall in jobs fuels US recession fears;;US employers cut jobs by the most in five years last month, increasing the odds that the economy has fallen into recession.The downbeat report raised expectations that the Federal Reserve will be forced to slash interest rates further to avoid a more serious downturn. President George W. Bush said he was “concerned”, adding it was clear the the economy had slowed.Non-farm payrolls fell 63,000 in February, the most since March 2003, marking a second consecutive monthly decline. Economists had expected an unchanged reading.Adding to the headache for investors, January’s loss of 17,000 jobs was revised lower to a decline of 22,000 while an initial estimate of a gain of 82,000 jobs in December was cut to 41,000.The one consolation was a fractional downtick in the unemployment rate, which fell a tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 per cent.John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns, said back-to-back nonfarm payroll declines were “a strong indication that the economy has fallen into recession”.Manufacturers (down 52,000), construction firms (down 39,000) and retailers (down 34,000) all slashed jobs last month while an increase of only 26,000 jobs in the services sector was the weakest since October 2005.“While jobs growth has been persistently negative in manufacturing and construction since the beginning of 2007, the recent loss of jobs from the service sector is a clear signal that economic activity is slowing,” Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon, said.After the jobs report, stocks retreated while treasuries rallied and the dollar plunged to a fresh record low against the euro.The futures market fully priced in a 75 basis point rate cut when the Fed meets later this month.Traders were alert to a bad number as immediately before the data the Fed increased to $100bn the total size of its March term auctions - whereby banks can borrow funds more cheaply from the Fed - to help ease liquidity pressures.The Fed also announce a series of new term repo operations which will allow banks to borrow another $100bn against collateral, including agency-backed mortgages.A report on private sector employment had indicated weakness in the jobs market earlier this week, registering an unexpected decline of 23,000 jobsAlthough initial jobless claims dipped in the latest week, they too have been trending higher. Data on US manufacturers have also been particularly weak while the ISM non-manufacturing index has contracted for two consecutive months.
737;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-02-29T21:52:54Z;Overview: Inflation concerns gain momentum;;The dollar fell to record lows, commodity prices climbed to fresh highs and credit spreads remained at elevated levels this week when concerns about the outlook for growth and inflation gathered pace.“Fears of the twin perils of ‘stagflation’ and credit-related paralysis appear to have become more acute this past 24 hours,” said Neil Mellor, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. “Just as evidence of diverging growth and inflation trends has accumulated, news of credit-related problems have continued to drip, drip, drip into the market place.”That steady drip continued to undermine investor confidence, despite some better news on US bond insurers’ credit ratings early in the week and the removal of portfolio limits on US mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.On Friday, uncertainty surrounded plans for a rescue of bond insurer Ambac, and UBS estimated that the credit crisis would result in losses of about $600bn for financial companies, against the $160bn of writedowns and credit losses so far disclosed.The liquidation of a $2bn asset-backed securities fund in London, more liquidations of other funds in New York on Friday and US insurer AIG unveiling nearly $15bn of writedowns added to the uncertainty.Meanwhile, expectations of more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts were cemented by a string of weak US economic reports, culminating in news on Friday that business activity in the Midwest had plunged to its lowest level since December 2001. Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, heightened the sense of gloom with a downbeat testimony on the economy to Congress and a warning that there was likely to be bank failures in the US.The futures market moved fully to price in a 50 basis point rate cut at the Fed’s next policy meeting and upped the odds of a 75bp easing to 62 per cent.Analysts pointed out that the turmoil in the credit markets was showing no sign of abating in spite of the US central bank’s 225 basis points of easing since September.“As the Fed has lowered the federal funds rate and provided more liquidity, credit spreads have widened and lending standards have tightened,” said Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.“Even chairman Bernanke seems to be losing confidence in what the Fed can do to stop the credit contagion,” said Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research.However, Mr Bernanke also expressed concerns that rising commodity prices were fuelling inflation, compounding worries triggered by strong price data on both sides of the Atlantic.“In light of the Fed’s heightened concerns over inflation, the most likely shock in the short run may well be that the Fed does not cut interest rates as sharply or as quickly as the market is discounting,” said Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort.Credit spreads widened again this week in both Europe and the US and in New York the CDX closed with credit protection costs near record levels.William Sels, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort, said spreads appeared to be wider than was justified by fundamentals – in part because conditions were likely to deteriorate further.But he added that fundamentals did not even need to deteriorate for spreads to widen. “When markets drop, they create a self-reinforcing negative spiral. We believe spreads will spike much further beyond fair value in this cycle than in the past,” he said.Equity markets in the US and Europe initially received a boost from hopes of further Fed rate cuts but by the end of the week had relinquished all their gains. Late in New York, the S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent over the week. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.4 per cent, although the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo ended the week 0.8 per cent higher, in spite of a 2.3 per cent fall on Friday.The uncertain economic outlook triggered strong demand for government bonds. The yield on the two-year US Treasury tumbled 35 basis points to 1.64 per cent, a four-year low, while the 10-year yield fell 26bp to 3.53 per cent. In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield eased 12bp to 3.88 per centIn the currency markets, the euro hit a record high against the dollar of $1.5238, with further support for the single currency coming from fading expectations of an early cut in eurozone rates. “With record-high inflation and record-low unemployment, right now the European Central Bank can’t afford to be pre-emptive on rates,” said Marco Valli, economist at UniCredit.“However, once it is clear that the downward trend in business sentiment is not temporary, they will be forced to move.”In commodities, the oil price appeared to take a firm foothhold above $100 a barrel when it reached a peak of $103.05. Gold continued to plough towards the $1,000 an ounce mark, hitting $975.90.
738;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Stagflation fears hit dollar;;The dollar weakened to a new low against the euro on Tuesday as data showed the US economy entering a prolonged period of slowing growth and rising inflation.The latest data from the world’s largest economy showed rising producer prices, falling consumer confidence and sharply lower house prices, reinforcing concerns over stagflation.Michael Woolfolk, at Bank of New York Mellon, said: “With the Federal Reserve committed to further rate cuts to limit the severity of the economic downturn this year, it is effectively playing a game of chicken with stagflation.”In New York, the euro set a new high of $1.4982 and was up 0.9 per cent at $1.4969 in late trade.The pound rose 0.3 per cent to $1.9855 and the yen rose 0.8 per cent to Y107.25.The euro was buoyed by an unexpected rise in German business confidence, as measured by the February Ifo business climate index. It rose to 104.1 from 103.4 in January, confounding expectations of a small drop, and expectations of near-term eurozone rate cuts faded.This overshadowed data showing growth in Europe’s biggest economy was held back by a fall in household spending. The euro gained 0.2 per cent against sterling to £0.7546.Conditions in credit and equity markets remained broadly positive for risk appetite and the carry trade, in which low-yielding currencies such as the yen are sold to fund purchases of higher-yielding currencies.The high-yielding Australian and New Zealand dollars, however, slipped against the yen after profit-taking.New Zealand’s dollar came under pressure after a report showed inflation expectations for the year ahead remained steady at 3 per cent while the growth outlook deteriorated.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand continues to target inflation and, at 8.25 per cent, the country has one of the highest rates in the developed world. But the central bank has not lifted the official cash rate since July’s quarter-point move.“Building evidence that the current monetary stance is having an impact on growth and inflation could prompt heavy selling,” said Derek Halpenny at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ.The kiwi fell 0.7 per cent against the yen to Y87.35 and 0.1 per cent against the US dollar to $0.8116.The Australian dollar declined 0.4 per cent against the yen to Y99.88 and was flat against the US unit at $0.9285.The Hungarian forint continued its advance after the country’s central bank allowed the currency to float freely on Monday. The trading band on the currency was abandoned in an effort to allow it to appreciate and help rein in inflation.Having gained 0.9 per cent against the euro on Monday, the forint was up a further 1.2 per cent by midday in New York to Ft258.60. Against the dollar, the forint rose 1.2 per cent to Ft173.70
739;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-02-18T17:18:55Z;Northern Rock concerns weigh on sterling;;Government plans to nationalise Northern Rock, the stricken UK mortgage lender, put pressure on the pound on Monday, raising concerns over the health of the country’s financial sector.Mitul Kotecha at Calyon said the announcement raised questions about other troubled mortgage lenders that had seen big share price falls in recent months.He said: “Over the next two weeks the release of UK banks’ results will prove interesting reading. The news is unlikely to be taken well by the pound”.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said it was difficult to underestimate Northern Rock’s negative impact on sterling during the past six months.He said it was the announcement on September 13 that Northern Rock had sought emergency funding from the Bank of England that led to the pound finally breaking out of the narrowing range in which it had been trading against the euro since May 2003. Since then, sterling has lost nearly 10 per cent of its value against the single currency.Mr Derrick said custodial flow data showed that since last July almost 75 per cent of all the net selling by foreign investors of UK equities had been of financial sector stocks.However, he said there had been a marked change since the end of January, with investors selling UK equities across all sectors.“It looks as if investors are switching away from simply worrying about the financial sector to instead wondering about how sharp the potential slowdown in the UK could prove to be,” he said.“Unsurprisingly, this only adds to our continued bearish outlook for the pound.”By midday in New York, the pound was down 0.5 per cent to $1.9515 against the dollar. It had lost 0.3 per cent to £0.7506 against the euro and eased 0.1 per cent to Y211.02 against the yen.Meanwhile, the Swiss franc also suffered, falling 0.9 per cent to SFr1.1030 against the dollar and 0.7 per cent to SFr1.6155 against the euro after Swiss retail sales disappointed in December, growing at under half their forecast rate.Elsewhere, the dollar started the week on the front foot, rising 0.2 per cent to $1.4650 against the euro and climbing 0.4 per cent to Y108.20 against the yen.However, it lost ground against its Australian counterpart, falling to a three-month low as the prospect of further rises in Australian interest rates continued to support the high-yielding currency.A run of strong Australian economic data, including news last week that unemployment had fallen to a 33-year low, has seen markets price in a 25 basis point rise to 7.25 per cent at the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy meeting in March.The Australian dollar rose 0.5 per cent to $0.9125 against the dollar and climbed 0.9 per cent to Y98.69 against the yen.
740;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-02-14T11:15:48Z;Japanese growth boosts carry trade;;High-yielding currencies advanced and low-yielding currencies suffered on Thursday as investors showed an increasing inclination to embrace risk.Following the rise in January’s US retail sales revealed on Wednesday, analysts said news that Japan’s economy grew 0.9 per cent in the fourth quarter soothed fears over the global economy.Neil Mellor, at Bank of New York Mellon, said: “Together, these reports have fuelled hope that the world’s two largest economies may yet avoid a technical recession, and investors have certainly been quick to capitalise.”The news lifted Asian equities, boosting risk appetite and pushing investors back into carry trades, in which low-yielding currencies are sold to finance the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets elsewhere.The Australian dollar was the star performer among high-yielding currencies. The Aussie was given a boost by an expectation-beating employment report that made it more likely that Australian interest rates were set to rise. Australia added 26,800 jobs in January, exceeding expectations for a rise of 15,000 and taking unemployment to its lowest level in more than 33 years.David Woo at Barclays Capital said the data sealed the deal on a 25 basis point rate rise to 7.25 per cent when the Reserve Bank of Australia has its policy meeting in March. “It also raises the chances of a follow up rate hike,” he said.By midday in New York, the Australian dollar rose 0.8 per cent to $0.9032 against the dollar and climbed 0.6 per cent to Y97.57 against the yen.Meanwhile, the low-yielding yen came under pressure, easing 0.1 per cent to Y158.00 against the euro, dropping 0.6 per cent to Y213.85 against the pound and losing 0.6 per cent to Y85.41 against the New Zealand dollar.Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas said equity markets were set to rebound and he was abandoning currency trades that benefited from risk aversion. He expected low-yielding currencies to come under pressure and the dollar to lose some value – except against the yen.Mr Redeker said the “sea change” had not only been provoked by the data, but by signs of significant capital injections into the financial industry. This was fuelled by reports that the Government of Singapore Investment Corp was investing $2bn-$3bn in a fund set up to invest in troubled financial institutions. “We suggest long positions in euro/dollar, dollar/yen and euro/yen.”The dollar eased 0.3 per cent to Y108.00 against the yen, however, after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, heightened the prospects of further cuts in US interest rates.The dollar also fell 0.4 per cent to $1.4630 against the euro and dropped 0.5 per cent to $1.9725 against the pound.
741;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-01-29T17:06:00Z;Pound strengthens against rising dollar;;"The pound rose to its highest level against the dollar so far this year after a report calmed fears over the UK retail sector and damped expectations of a series of aggressive UK interest rate cuts.A survey from the Confederation of British Industry indicated that UK retail sales lost further momentum in January as the balance
of retailers reporting rising sales dropped to a 14-month low.However, analysts said sales volumes in January were still stronger than expected.Furthermore, the rise in expectations for sales in February also suggested that there might be some stabilisationin the short term.Howard Archer at Global Insight said: “The survey indicates that consumer spending is not collapsing, which reinforces the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates gradually rather than aggressively given current significant inflation risks”.The pound rose to a high of $1.9929 against the dollar, before paring its gains to stand up 0.2 per cent at $1.9870 by midday in New York. Sterling also rose 0.3 per cent to £0.7427 against the euro and climbed 0.2 per cent to Y212.50 against the yen.Meanwhile, news of a unexpectedly large jump in US durable goods orders in December gave the dollar a lift.Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon said the figures could be the first of a series of data this week – including today’s US GDP figures and Friday’s US employment report – that showed although the US economy was decelerating, it was still some way from recession.“If this proves correct, the impact on the greenback may well be negative as reduced risk aversion prompts a reversal in dollar safe haven flows.”However, the dollar rose 0.2 per cent to $1.4760 against the euro, climbed 0.4 per cent to SFr1.0940 against the Swiss franc and edged 0.1 per cent higher to Y106.95 against the yen.Analysts said the currency market’s limited reaction to the figures reflected caution ahead of Wednesday’s interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, which was widely expected to cut its Fed funds rate by 50 basis points to 3 per cent.However, the Canadian dollar bucked the trend, rising through parity against the dollar for the first time in three weeks as it climbed 0.7 per cent to $C0.9975.Analysts put the loonie’s strong performance down to buoyant global stock and gold prices.Adam Cole at RBC Capital Markets said: “The Canadian dollar is the most cyclical of the major currencies, given the very open nature of Canada’s economy and its reliance on commodities .“It tends to be strong when equities or precious metals rally.”"
742;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-01-23T16:48:36Z;Risk-averse traders return to the yen;;The yen rallied sharply on Wednesday, hitting its strongest level for two-and-a-half years against the dollar as rising risk aversion gripped the currency markets.Analysts said it was clear that Tuesday’s emergency US interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve – which triggered a knee-jerk sell-off in the yen – had not been enough to restore investors’ confidence over the health of the global economy.Indeed, the yen advanced on Wednesday as investors pared back carry trades, in which the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets is funded by selling the low-yielding Japanese currency.“The Fed’s rate cut has come and gone and so did the decline in the Japanese yen,” said Ashraf Laidi at CMC Markets. “Renewed gains are seen extending.”By midday in New York, the yen was up 0.8 per cent to Y105.60 against the dollar, climbed 1.3 per cent to Y153.75 against the euro and gained 1.3 per cent to Y206.10 against the pound.The low-yielding Swiss franc also advanced, rising 0.4 per cent to SFr1.0910 against the dollar and 0.9 per cent to SFr1.5878 against the euro.Meanwhile, the pound lost ground against the dollar as the minutes of the Bank of England’s January monetary policy committee meeting suggested the central bank was not set to follow the Fed with a series of aggressive cuts in UK interest rates. The minutes revealed an 8-1 vote in favour of keeping rates on hold.Worries over rising inflation were behind the decision, with members worrying that back-to-back cuts in UK interest rates would signal the central bank was now targeting demand rather than inflation.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said the expected rise in short-term inflation would probably mean the Bank of England was unable to implement rate cuts at a pace that would soothe market fears over the gloomy prospects for the UK economy.“We strongly suspect the pound will continue on its downward path against both the euro and the dollar,” he said. “Sterling’s 2007 low of $1.9217 against the dollar is only one or two poor data releases away.”The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.9522 against the dollar. However, sterling was flat at £0.7460 against the euro.The euro came under pressure as a survey suggested the eurozone economy was set to weaken, strengthening the view that the European Central Bank might have to abandon its hawkish stance on interest rates.The eurozone purchasing managers’ index fell from 53.3 last month to 52.7 in January, lower than consensus and implying growth slowed below its trend rate at the start of the year.Marco Valli at UniCredit said while the data might not change the ECB’s hawkish rhetoric in the very near term, it was becoming increasingly clear that eurozone growth had started to slide.“A more cautious ECB stance seems warranted,” he said. “We expect them to start cutting rates sometime in the third quarter.”The euro fell 0.5 per cent to $1.4555 against the dollar.
743;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-01-17T16:47:47Z;View of the day: Euro;;The euro’s failure to make serious headway against the dollar is curious given that interest rate expectations have moved in favour of the single currency, says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.He notes that the market has begun to toy with the idea of a 25 basis point cut in eurozone borrowing costs by the end of the year but adds that rate expectations still favour the euro.“Whilst at the start of the year Fed fund futures prices held the implicit view that US interest rates would be slashed by 100bp through the course of 2008, the market now foresees some 150bp worth of cuts.”Mr Mellor says the euro’s initial failure to respond to the rise in US rate expectations coincided with the conclusion of a European delegation’s visit to China back in November – during which the delegation pleaded the case for a stronger renminbi.“The euro is now trading some 3.5 per cent lower against the renminbi than at the time of the meeting.”He also notes that the yields of a number of benchmark European government bonds continue to trade at relatively high levels against their German equivalent.“Could it be that the euro’s failure to derive greater support from improving interest rate differentials is down to the re-orientation of Chinese reserve diversification away from the euro and investor caution amidst talk of an economic ‘division’ across the eurozone?”
744;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Yen may rise further as global asset prices falter;;The current turmoil in financial markets has revealed the extent to which the low-yielding yen has funded soaring global asset prices in recent years.Last year, the yen tumbled to multi-year lows against a raft of currencies as carry trade investors sold the currency to finance the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets elsewhere.But now, as asset prices falter, the yen is threatening to climb sharply to levels that might alarm the Japanese authorities.The Japanese currency has soared in recent days as fears of US recession have prompted a fresh exodus from carry trades.On Wednesday it surged to a 2½-year high of Y105.93 against the dollar, taking its gains since the start of the year to 5.1 per cent.So far in 2008, it has risen 3.2 per cent against the euro, 5.3 per cent against the pound, 3.9 per cent against the Australian dollar and 6 per cent against the New Zealand dollar.But analysts say the current unwinding of carry trades differs from those that occurred during bouts of risk aversion last year.This is because the yen’s rally has come amid falls not just in high-yielding currencies and equities in developed markets, but also in metals and emerging market stocks.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said it was becoming clear just how broadly the yen had been used to fund investment across the financial markets, not just the purchase of high-yielding currencies. “You can see from the sharp drops across a whole range of high-yielding assets the extent to which the yen has been used as a funding vehicle,” he said. “This is going to run and run. The yen clearly has room to strengthen considerably.”This should trigger alarm bells in Japan, where Toshihiko Fukui, governor of the Bank of Japan, has emphasised the downside risks to growth due to deteriorating conditions in the US.Sebastian Galy, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort, said Japanese authorities would not allow a strengthening currency to push the country’s economy into recession.“Intervention is therefore almost certain if we see another bout of strong yen appreciation,” he said.The last time the Japanese authorities intervened to stem yen strength in March 2005, they drew a line under dollar/yen at Y101.But Mr Galy said Japanese intervention was more likely against a basket of currencies. The flow of the country’s trade has changed and the US elections are bound to provoke a backlash against dollar intervention. “Hence, the intervention level is probably lower than Y101 against the dollar.”The activity of yield-hungry Japanese retail investors may also alarm authorities, providing an extra incentive to try to cap the yen.Tokyo Financial Exchange data show retail margin traders have taken advantage of the stròng yen to raise their bets against the currency to levels not seen since last August, when a currency rally caused them considerable pain.
745;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
746;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2008-01-09T18:25:48Z;The Short View: Sterling pounded;;"Where the dollar led last year, will sterling follow in 2008?The pound has taken over the dollar’s roll as the whipping boy of the currency markets. Since touching $2.11 in November, the pound has dropped more than 7 per cent and on Wednesday fell through $1.96.The Bank of England is likely to leave rates on hold on Thursday, although there is a chance it could cut, weakening the pound (the European Central Bank will remain on hold).Those high rates are sterling’s principal means of support. They are the highest in the developed world. This will remain true after the Bank’s meeting, but by the end of the year, the differential between sterling interest rates and those of the other leading currencies is more likely to narrow than widen, given fears of a UK recession.Other factors are more alarming. The UK’s current account deficit, at 5.7 per cent
of gross domestic product, is the highest of the leading economies, and may be understated.Purchasing power parity will not offer the pound any support for a long time yet – $1.96 buys far more in the US than £1 does in the UK.And history is discouraging. Since 1985, when the pound hit a record low, the average dollar exchange rate has been $1.646. Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s biggest custodian of investor assets, says it is almost 18 per cent above long-term averages compared with the dollar, and more than 8 per cent above its long-term average against the yen.When the pound is overvalued, it has a strong tendency to snap back sharply. The pound is now slightly below its average value against the euro since 1985 (taking a “synthetic” euro derived from its predecessor currencies). But it is still far above the mid-1990s, when the UK’s recovery took hold.Traders seem convinced that a bet against sterling is as safe as a bet against the dollar was a year ago. It is hard to disagree.john.authers@ft.comwww.ft.com/shortview"
747;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-12-20T18:23:00Z;Overview: Credit market concerns persist;;Persistent credit market concerns kept a lid on global equities on Thursday as Bear Stearns reported its first quarterly loss after writing down $1.9bn on its mortgage inventory – twice the amount expected.The news came hard on the heels of Morgan Stanley’s revelation of $9.4bn of subprime writedowns.Investors also remained concerned about the outlook for bond insurers after MBIA revealed some $30bn of exposure to collateralised debt obligations. On Tuesday, Standard & Poor’s lowered its ratings outlook on several bond insurers, or monolines.The steady drip of grim news offset this week’s central bank liquidity injections, which have helped relieve some of the stress in money markets by bringing down interbank lending rates.Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said: “Notwithstanding the fact that some sterling and euro interbank rates remain at fairly elevated levels, the liquidity auctions of the past few days have undoubtedly met with success.“Nevertheless, uncertainty as to the sheer dimension of the subprime lending crisis remains at a heightened level and to the detriment of confidence across equity markets.”Dollar, euro and sterling Libor rates continued to fall, with three-month sterling dropping 6 basis points to 6.14 per cent – its sixth successive fall. The drop in sterling deposit rates has also been attributed to widespread expectations that the Bank of England will cut official rates again soon – a view given further credence by news that the UK’s current account deficit had widened to a record high of £20bn in the third quarter.On the currency markets the pound dived to a four-month low against the dollar below $1.99 and touched a 1½-year low on a trade-weighted basis.Meanwhile, credit worries gave a lift to the yen as heightened risk aversion steered investors away from carry trades, where low-yielding currencies such as the yen are sold to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets.The Japanese unit rose despite the Bank of Japan’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged and downgrade its economic outlook.Equity markets lacked a clear direction. By midday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent lower, although the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent – helped by encouraging earnings from software group Oracle.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 managed a rise of 0.3 per cent, while the FTSE 100 in London gained 1 per cent.In Asia, Tokyo halted a six-session losing streak, although the Nikkei 225 Average only managed a paltry single-point gain.But Sydney extended its run of losses to seven days, while Seoul eased back 0.9 per cent in spite of some positive broker comment about the election of Lee Myung-bak, the pro-market conservative, as president-elect of South Korea.News that China had raised interest rates for the sixth time time this year came too late to have any impact on the Shanghai market. The composite index rose 2.1 per cent.US government bonds pushed higher after some disappointing data on manufacturing activity. The Philadelphia Fed index came in at -5.7 this month, compared with 8.2 in November.Alan Ruskin, international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said: “The data suggest that one of the previously stronger sectors, manufacturing, is probably starting to decelerate more meaningfully – plainly not a good thing for the dollar or equities, while certainly bond friendly.”Meanwhile, there were signs of a deterioration in the US labour market as initial jobless claims rose by 12,000 last week to 346,000 – more than had been expected. US gross domestic product growth in the third quarter was left unrevised at an annualised 4.9 per cent.The yield on the 10-year Treasury was down 3bp at 4.00 per cent, while the two-year yield was 6bp lower at 3.05 per cent.In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield fell 2bp to 4.27 per cent but the yield on the Japanese 10-year government bond rose 3bp to 1.52 per cent.In commodities, oil pushed above $92 a barrel before retreating amid forecasts of a mild winter in the US. Gold dipped back below $800 an ounce.
748;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-11-28T00:03:44Z;Yen dips against dollar, euro and pound;;The yen lost ground and high-yielding currencies rallied after Citigroup, the largest US bank, announced that it was selling a stake to the Abu Dhabi government.Analysts said the news helped to calm fears over the health of the financial sector, boosting risk appetite and demand for carry trades, in which low-yielding currencies are sold to fund the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon said:“This was clearly interpreted as a sign of progress in the wake of an al-most unanimously negative stream of news from the credit sector.“Suddenly, the world is a better place and risk is a more tolerable prospect.”The low-yielding yen fell across the board, dropping 1 per cent to Y108.40 against the dollar by midday in New York, by 1 per cent to Y161.15 against the euro and also by 1 per cent to Y224.35 against the pound.The yen’s losses against higher-yielding currencies were more pronounced as it tumbled 1.6 per cent to Y94.74 against the Australian dollar and 2.3 per cent to Y82.27 against the New Zealand dollar.Hans Redeker at BNP Paribas said the news of Abu Dhabi’s $7.5bn investment in Citigroup suggested that Middle East investors not only had adequate funds to pump into western capital markets, but they also saw financial institutions as relatively cheap.However, he cautioned that $7.5bn was a drop in the ocean compared with the $300bn loss that, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was faced by the financial industry as a result of the recent credit squeeze.He said: “It is important to know if this Citigroup offer is the start of similar moves from other substantial investors or whether it is a one-off deal.“The latter would mean that recent support for low-yielding currencies will remain intact.”The dollar initially rallied on the Citigroup news, but reversed its gains as figures later in the session showed a further fall in US house prices and a sharp drop in US consumer confidence in November.The dollar stood flat at $2.0705 against the pound, rose 0.2 per cent to SFr1.0990 against the Swiss franc, but eased 0.1 per cent to $1.4870 against the euro.Meanwhile, an unexpected rise in the Ifo index of German business confidence and an above-forecast reading of German inflation supported the euro.Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman said the data underscored his belief that while the next move in eurozone interest rates might be a cut, the European Central Bank would be in no hurry.“We do not expect an ECB rate cut until late in the second half of next year,” he said.

750;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-11-20T14:28:41Z;Rate talk sends dollar to record low;;The dollar fell to a record low against the euro on Tuesday as speculation swept the currencies markets that the Federal Reserve was set to deliver an emergency cut in US interest rates.Traders said the talk was that that the Fed would cut interest rates when it released its new growth forecasts and the minutes from its October meeting at 1900GMT.The dollar fell 1 per cent to an all-time low of $1.44813 against the euro, dropped 0.8 per cent to $2.0650 against the pound and lost 0.8 per cent to SFr1.1070 against the Swiss franc.Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon dismissed the speculation, however.“The Fed will want to keep its options open,” he sad. “By introducing an emergency rate cut, it would send the wrong message out to the market and seriously undermine its credibility.”David Woo at Barclays Capital said the likelihood was that Fed’s economic projections would be more upbeat than expected.“With the market relatively confident about the prospects for a rate cut in December, the risk is these expectations will be disappointed somewhat, which would be positive for the dollar,” he said.Meanwhile, stability on Asian equity markets put pressure on the yen as a pick-up in risk appetite saw the yen give back Monday’s gains.Analysts said heightened risk appetite had prompted renewed demand for carry trades, in which the low-yielding yen is sold to finance the purchase of higher-yielding, riskier assets elsewhere.The yen fell 0.2 per cent to Y109.95 against the dollar, lost 1.1 per cent to Y162.88 against the euro and dropped 1.1 per cent to Y227.29 against the pound.However, Derek Halpenny at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said yen sell-offs were becoming less convincing by the day and he doubted the return of risk appetite would be prolonged.He said the key signal of impending trouble for the financial markets in August was the sudden loss of liquidity in the money markets that triggered a spike in short-term money market rates.“The very same development is now taking place again,” he said. “With financial markets in stress again, the scope for yen weakness looks limited.”
751;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-11-19T22:17:11Z;Global overview: Equity rout lifts bonds and yen;;Global equity markets grabbed the headlines on Monday as a renewed bout of risk aversion drove several leading stock indices below key levels but offered support to government bonds and the Japanese yen.“Risk aversion in the face of fear for the global economic outlook appears to remain the predominant market theme,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly fell through 13,000 points while UK and continental European blue chips dropped below the levels at which they started the year.The main catalyst for losses was a downgrade of US investment bank Citigroup by rival Goldman Sachs.News that Swiss Re, the reinsurer, expected a $1.1bn writedown from its exposure to credit default swaps heightened fears that the impact of the credit squeeze was spreading beyond the banking sector.Michael Vaknin, economist at Goldman Sachs, warned that markets were likely to carry on suffering fallout from the subprime crisis well into next year.“Over the past two weeks, financial markets continued to erase the optimism that surfaced after the Fed’s first rescue package back in September,” Mr Vaknin said. “This has largely occurred on the back of further upward revisions of the total-loss estimates on outstanding US mortgages. As long as this marking-to-market process continues, financial skeletons will likely keep popping up here and there, exerting further pain on markets.” Financial stocks led the way lower on Wall Street.By the close in New York, the Dow was down 1.7 per cent at 12,958.44 points. The S&P 500 index was down 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.7 per cent lower.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,462.76 – its lowest close since mid-August and back below the 1,483.47 level at which it ended 2006. The FTSE 100 index in London suffered even more, plunging 2.7 per cent to 6,120.8, 100 points below its 2007 starting point, as mining stocks endured heavy selling.Asian equities also suffered broad losses. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.7 per cent to a 16-month low, while Seoul fell 1.7 per cent to a two-month low, Taipei shed 1 per cent and Hong Kong lost 0.6 per cent.There were further signs of stress in the money markets as interbank lending rates continued to rise – pointing to an unwillingness among banks to lend to each other.The three-month sterling Libor rate rose nearly 5 basis points – its seventh successive rise and the biggest increase for nearly two months – to its highest level since September 19.The three-month euro rate was set at its highest level for four weeks. The three-month dollar rate also rose.The weakness in global equities underpinned gains for government bonds and pushed US benchmark yields to two-year lows. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was down 10bp at 4.07 per cent while the two-year bond was 18bp lower at 3.16 per cent.In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield fell 7bp to 4.06 per cent while the yield on two-year paper shed 8bp to 3.72 per cent.Risk aversion was evident in the currency markets as the yen and Swiss franc benefited from an unwinding of carry trades, in which low-yielding currencies are sold to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets.The yen moved back towards last week’s 18-month high against the dollar and the Swiss franc touched a fresh 12-year peak.The US currency was a shade higher against sterling and flat against the euro.“While we are tempering our bullish views on euro/dollar, we think the yen has further upside against the greenback as equity weakness and renewed credit concerns could lead to further unwind of carry trades,” said David Woo, head of foreign exchange strategy at Barclays Capital.In commodities, the US oil benchmark price rose 80 cents a barrel after the Opec summit in Riyadh at the weekend.Gold fell further below $800 an ounce, although platinum touched a record high because of worries about supply disruptions in South Africa.Base metals staged a broad retreat amid worries about China’s latest moves to cool down its red-hot economy.
752;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-11-14T19:08:13Z;Overview: Uncertainty persists despite positive US data;;Uncertainty remained the key theme in financial markets as reassuring comments from the banking sector and some broadly positive US economic data failed to quell lingering credit worries on Wednesday.Bear Stearns, the US investment bank, said it expected to write down $1.2bn of mortgage-linked assets in the fourth quarter – less than many in the markets feared.The announcement came hard on the heels of a positive trading update from HSBC and comments from Goldman Sachs that it did not expect any large mortgage-related writedowns this quarter.Meanwhile, data showed that US retail sales, excluding cars, rose by 0.2 per cent last month, sharply down from September’s revised 0.7 per cent increase but ahead of expectations. The figures helped calm fears that consumer demand was about to slump because of the housing market crisis and sky-high oil prices.“While consumption patterns may be shifting, it appears that consumer spending remains undaunted in the face of soaring food and energy prices and a collapsing housing market,” said Bank of New York Mellon.Inflation concerns were also soothed by data showing a 0.1 per cent increase in October US producer prices. The benign inflation news helped reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut US interest rates again in December.Despite the positive news, US equities struggled to build on Tuesday’s strong performance. By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent after putting in its best performance in nearly two months on Tuesday. The S&P 500 index was 0.3 per cent higher and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1 per cent. European stocks pared an early advance and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended with a gain of 0.4 per cent.But Asia stormed ahead, with most markets enjoying gains of 2-5 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average bounced 2.5 per cent from Tuesday’s 15-month low – snapping an eight-day losing streak – while Hong Kong leapt 4.9 per cent, its best one-day rise for nearly three months. The Chinese and Indian markets also rose strongly.In spite of the uncertainty created by weakening macro-economic conditions, higher energy prices and continuing credit concerns, the latest fund managers’ survey from Merrill Lynch indicated that global investors appeared reluctant to change their strategies.“Investors are holding their nerve despite the gloomy outlook for growth and profit expectations,” said David Bowers, independent consultant to Merrill.Government bonds were largely flat as investors took their cue from equity market movements. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was up one basis point at 4.27 per cent and the two-year yield was 1bp higher at 3.55 per cent.In Europe, the yield on the 10-year Bund was 1bp higher at 4.15 per cent and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield bounced off Tuesday’s 22-month low, rising 3bp to 1.51 per cent.On the currency markets, sterling touched its lowest level against the euro for four years as the Bank of England’s quarterly inflation report heightened expectations that UK interest rates would soon be on the way down.Nick Kounis, senior economist at Fortis, said that, in the BoE’s central scenario, which is conditioned on market expectations of about 50bp of rate cuts in 2008 and the possibility of further easing in 2009, inflation was seen on target at the end of the two-year horizon. “We see a 25bp rate cut in February and an additional 25bp reduction in May,” Mr Kounis said.Meanwhile, the dollar continued to slide, with the euro pushing to within sight of last week’s record high of $1.4752.In commodities, oil prices rebounded sharply ahead of the release of US inventories data on Thursday that are expected to show another drop in US crude stocks.Benchmark December West Texas Intermediate climbed back above $93 a barrel after sliding $3.45 in the previous session. Last week, WTI hit a record $98.62.Gold climbed back above the $800 an ounce mark as the dollar softened and oil prices rose. Base metals prices were broadly higher, with tin hitting a record high.
753;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The Short View: Correlation;;Whether in forex or equities, this week’s pattern is the same: down with a thud on Monday, and a rebound on Tuesday.These trends are linked. Viewed on a graph, the euro-yen exchange rate and world stock indices are identical. They move in tandem, with stocks falling with the euro and rebounding with falls in the yen.Why? This is linked to the carry trade – borrowing in low-yielding yen and parking in higher yielding currencies such as the New Zealand dollar (kiwi). Traders make money from the difference in yields.When stocks do well, traders are happy to put money into the carry trade. They take forex profits when stocks do badly.But there is a snag with this hypothesis. Futures data show speculative positions betting against the yen have dwindled almost to zero since August. This should not be surprising. At one point, the yen gained 14 per cent against the kiwi during the summer.Also, some of the strongest currencies do not offer much of a yield. Notably, the Canadian dollar (loonie) gained 22 per cent against the dollar this year (and gave back 5 per cent of that on Monday), all while yielding less than sterling.Two other hypotheses might work. First, Simon Derrick of Bank of New York Mellon suggests Monday’s switchback could be down to growth worries. If worried about inflation, you buy currencies like the loonie. It is backed by commodities and a conservative central bank. If more worried about growth, such currencies are the last place to be. (And stocks are not much better.)Another radical hypothesis: the yen might have to do with Japan. It has been weak due to weak economic data. Third quarter growth was better than expected, partly because the low yen helped exports. Then traders took the hint when Japan’s prime minister warned against a strong yen in Tuesday’s Financial Times.
754;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-11-12T21:45:13Z;Overview: Risk aversion hits markets;;A decline in risk appetite hit financial markets on Monday, and as the Japanese yen rose sharply higher, emerging market assets and commodities fell and US equity volatility closed at its highest level this year.While European financial stocks rebounded, early gains for US banks and brokerages faded and Wall Street closed lower.Analysts say financials look attractive from a valuation perspective, but investors are worried about further credit and mortgage market losses.On the currency markets, the yen climbed to an 18-month high against the dollar and made strong gains against high-yielders such as the Australian dollar.“The currency market is into another full-blown bout of risk aversion created, seemingly, by tensions in the financial sector as banks reveal deeper losses as a consequence of the strains in the subprime market,” said Steve Barrow, chief currency strategist at Bear Stearns.Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said: “Along with a constant drip of credit-related problems in the background, the yen’s recent ascent has been part of a broad retrenchment in risk amid concern over the imp-act on global growth of multi-decade highs in many currency pairs and asset prices.“Should concerns over the outlook for global economic growth continue to rise, then clearly attention will turn to central banks for answers.”There was much-needed respite for the dollar against most other currencies.The dollar index, which tracks the US unit against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.7 per cent, its best day for three weeks. The dollar also rebounded against the euro after hitting a succession of record lows last week.There were sharp losses for emerging market equities, bonds and currencies. The MSCI Emerging Markets Free equity index was down 2.4 per cent, while the spread of emerging market bond yields over Treasuries widened by 3 basis points.The South African rand and the Turkish lira both fell sharply against the dollar.US equities attempted a tentative rebound following last week’s steep losses, but late in the day the market lost steam and financials turned lower.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index closed above 31.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent while the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.7 per cent. The leading US benchmarks are approaching a decline of 10 per cent below their recent peaks, a move that constitutes a correction in trend. The Nasdaq is down 9.6 per cent from its recent peak, while the Dow has fallen 8 per cent. The bluechip barometer closed below 13,000 yesterday, the first time since mid-August, at the height of the credit squeeze that it has fallen below that threshold.In Brazil, the Bovespa index fell 4.3 per cent while Mexcio had declined 3.3 per cent as investors reduced their exposure to emerging market stocks.Gains for European banking stocks helped the FTSE Eurofirst 300 recover from an early decline and close flat at 1,512.36.It was a miserable session for Asian stocks, as the Nikkei 225 Average tumbled 2.5 per cent to an 18-month low and most other markets in the region fell between 2 and 4 per cent.In Shanghai the composite index ended 2.4 per cent weaker but well off its low for the day, after the People’s Bank of China announced a 50bp increase in the bank reserve requirement ratio.Mainland stocks listed in Hong Kong, or H-shares, fell 6 per cent, while the blue-chip Hang Seng index shed 3.9 per cent.Trading in government bonds was subdued given the closure of US bond markets for the Veterans’ Day holiday.In Europe, the yield on the two-year Schatz edged up 2bp to 3.83 per cent after touching a fresh eight-month low early in the session.The two-year gilt yield was flat at 4.73 per cent, in spite of data showing UK producer price inflation at its highest level for nearly 12 years last month.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the data were likely to add to the Bank of England’s wariness about trimming rates in the very near-term.“More significant, though, will be how consumer price inflation develops and how much economic activity softens over the coming weeks in the face of increasing headwinds,” he said.UK October CPI figures are due out on Tuesday.Commodities retreated across the board, with oil leading as delegates gathered in Saudi Arabia for this week’s meeting of Opec, the oil producers’ cartel.December West Texas Intermediate closed below $95 a barrel after touching a record $98.62 last week.The weaker oil price and the broadly firmer dollar briefly pushed gold below the $800 an ounce level after it touched a 28-year peak last week and came within a whisker of its $850 record high.Base metals also came under pressure because of concerns that demand might be hit by any slowdown in global growth.
755;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-11-06T19:28:19Z;Dollar left behind in ‘scramble for value’;;"The dollar fell to a record low against the euro Tuesday as worries over the state of the US economy continued to weigh on the currency.The dollar fell to a low of $1.4571 against the euro, declining below Friday’s all-time trough of $1.4528 before paring its gains to stand down 0.7 per cent at $1.4560 by midday in New York.The dollar index, which tracks its value against a basket of six leading currencies, dropped to a record low of 75.986.Mitul Kotecha, at Calyon, said the dollar remained susceptible to further declines over coming days.“Concerns about financial sector credit problems have once again dampened risk appetite,” he said. “And once again the fact that these concerns have originated in the US, following announcements of losses at US banks, has meant that the dollar has failed to benefit from safe-haven buying.”The dollar fell 0.4 per cent to a fresh 26-year low of $2.0906 against the pound; dropped 0.8 per cent to SFr1.1437 against the Swiss franc and eased 0.1 per cent to Y114.35 against the yen.Commodity-linked currencies benefited as gold and oil prices advanced.Ian Mellor, at Bank of New York Mellon, said that the uncertain proportions of the banking crisis, the dwindling support for the dollar and surging commodity prices had shrouded the global economic outlook in uncertainty.“Accordingly there has been a scramble for a creditable store of value,” he said. “So, gold, commodities in general and the currencies of their producers – items of tangible worth – have risen to the top of the market’s shopping list.”The Canadian dollar rose 0.9 per cent to a fresh record high of C$0.9237 against the dollar, the Norwegian krone climbed 0.9 per cent to NKr5.3410 while the South African rand gained 1 per cent to R6.5000.The Australian dollar rose 0.6 per cent to $0.9250 against the dollar. Analysts said the Aussie, which last week hit a 23-year high above $0.9340, was receiving support from expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia would move to raise interest rates after its policy meeting Wednesday.“The RBA is universally expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent,” said Gavin Friend at Commerzbank.“Providing the market gets what it expects, the Australian dollar should consolidate at these heady levels and at least take a look at recent highs.”The yen lost ground after figures showed the Japanese economy continued to lose momentum.Japan’s leading economic index, the broadest indicator of the country’s economic outlook, dropped to zero in September.The yen fell 0.5 per cent to Y166.44 against the euro and lost 0.3 per cent to Y238.70 against the sterling."

Last year’s Sibos conference in Sydney attracted 5,300 attendees, including delegates and exhibitors.Pauline Skypala, editor of FTfm, is attending the conference this year and has launched a series of video interviews with some of the conference luminaries.FTfm has spoken to Tim Keaney, chief executive officer, Bank of New York Mellon Asset Servicing about convergence between alternative investments and mainstream investment and also the reasons for the Bank of New York Mellon merger.Kevin Cronin, head of investments, Putnam Investments talks to FTfm about the recent market turbulence, Putnam’s change of ownership and a shift in investment strategy.Jim Swanson, chief investment strategist, MFS Investment Management, talks about the move towards alternative investments and the future of consolidation in the fund management industry.On Tuesday, FTfm spoke to Ron Logue, chairman and chief executive, State Street, Neeraj Sahai, global head of securities and fund services, Citigroup and Michael Clark, chief executive officer, JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services.
757;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-09-27T20:58:20Z;Overview: Equities higher amid US housing woes;;"Global equities remained on an upward track on Thursday in spite of further evidence of the crisis facing the US housing market and lingering concerns about tight conditions in the money markets.Emerging market stocks were particularly strong, offering a fresh sign that investor risk appetite was recovering.The Morgan Stanley Capital International emerging market equity index touched a record high above the 1,200 level, giving it a rise of 30 per cent this year. By comparison, the MSCI World index has risen about 12 per cent in 2007.“The shift to more constructive crisis management by the Fed and other major central banks in recent weeks, coupled with the relatively better-than-expected banks earnings season,
have brought a significant rebound in risky assets,” said Michael Vaknin, analyst at Goldman Sachs.But he added: “A continuation of this trend is now more challenging ahead of further subprime developments and commercial banks’ earnings.”Worries about credit conditions and the outlook for the US economy remained near the surface on Thursday.The European Central Bank said it had lent €3.9bn ($5.5bn) at its penalty rate of 5 per cent, the largest amount since October 2004.This was compounded by news that the three-month London interbank-offered euro rate was fixed at 4.78688 per cent, the highest since May 2001.Meanwhile, US new home sales tumbled 8.3 per cent in August to an annual rate of 795,000, the lowest level for more than seven years.Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics descr-ibed the figures as “just hideous” and suggested the really bad news was that the data largely pre-dated recent market turmoil. “US housing is nowhere near the bottom; neither is its wider impact,” he said.The figures followed news of an unexpected fall in initial jobless claims last week and a downward revision to second-quarter gross domestic product growth.“The claims data perhaps provide the most interesting twist to the morning’s reports, as the figures raise the risk that the September jobs report will reverse much of the August weakness and significantly alter market interpretation of the US growth path,” said Action Economics.On the currency markets, the dollar remained on the back foot, touching yet another lifetime low against the euro and a record low against a basket of currencies. The single currency hit $1.4189, while the dollar index touched 78.159, the lowest since its launch in 1973.The single currency found support from robust eurozone money supply and German inflation figures and news of another fall in German unemployment.John Norman, currency analyst at JPMorgan, said he expected the euro to hit $1.45 by year-end and to peak near $1.48 in the first quarter of 2008 in anticipation of higher US rates later next year.But the European data did little to dent eurozone government bonds as the market focused on the weak US housing data and month end buying.The yield on the two-year German bond fell 1bp to 4.07 per cent. The two-year US Treasury yield was down 4bp lower at 3.95 per cent and there was strong investor demand for new five-year notes. The yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds rose 5.5bp to a six-week high of 1.72 per cent.There were strong gains for equity markets right across the Asia-Pacific region. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 climbed 2.4 per cent to a six-week high while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong powered through the 27,000 level to a new closing peak. Record highs were also struck in Singapore, Sydney and Mumbai.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.8 per cent to 1,551.49.Wall Street closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 per cent, the S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent.In commodities, oil moved higher amid fresh concerns about tropical storm disruption in the Gulf. November West Texas Intermediate rose towards $83 a barrel.Wheat prices surged to record highs after the International Grains Council cut its forecast for global and Australian wheat production. Gold remained within sight of Friday’s near-28-year high of $739 an ounce."
758;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T04:23:27+0000;Bank protection concerns hit sterling;;Sterling took a hit on Tuesday as worries over UK deposit protection raised fresh concerns about the health of the country’s financial system in the wake of the recent run on Northern Rock, the troubled UK mortgage lender.Analysts said reports that the UK’s deposit protection scheme might not be enough to pay for the government’s plan to guarantee consumers’ deposits up to £100,000 weighed on the currency.The UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme’s resources were estimated at £4.4m – compared with a similar US fund of $49bn.David Woo at Barclays Capital said the report was sterling-negative for two reasons. “First, because, if true, it increases the probability that the government will change its previously hands-off approach to the UK financial sector. We think that the market-friendly approach of UK authorities has supported the pound over the past decade,” he said. “And second, because it is negative news about the UK financial sector at a time of great nervousness about this important part of the UK economy.”By mid-afternoon in New York, the pound had fallen 0.2 per cent to $2.0181 against the dollar, 0.6 per cent to £0.7008 against the euro and 0.5 per cent to Y231.08 against the yen.Adding to pressure on the pound was a warning from the International Monetary Fund that stability in the UK housing market was not sustainable. The IMF said the UK non-conforming mortgage market was “somewhat comparable” to the US subprime mortgage market.“This certainly rings alarm bells for those that remember the housing market slowdown of 17 years ago in the UK and the knock-on impact for the economy,” said Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon.Analysts said credit worries tempered risk appetite and demand for carry trades, in which low-yielding currencies such as the yen are sold to finance the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets elsewhere.The high-yielding New Zealand and Australian dollars fell 1.3 per cent to Y84.69 and 0.3 per cent to Y99.49 respectively.Elsewhere, the yen rose 0.1 per cent to Y161.90 against the euro and 0.3 per cent to Y114.50 against the dollar.Meanwhile, the dollar sank to a record low against the euro for the fourth consecutive session after data revealed US existing home sales dropped to a five-year low and US consumer confidence fell to its weakest level in two years.Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said the reports pointed to the need for further cuts in US interest rates. “With Armageddon in the housing market, employment shrinking and energy prices surging, you can hardly blame consumers for feeling glum,” he said.The dollar fell to $1.4153 against the euro before recovering to stand at $1.4144, down 0.4 per cent.

He is probably most well known for correctly forecasting to the month China’s historic change of currency policy in 2005.………………………………………………………………………………………………………What effect do you think the collapse of Northern Rock in the UK will have on the GBP/EUR exchange rate? Do you think the pound is likely to weaken substantially against the euro in the coming months?
Mark HughesSimon Derrick: EUR/GBP is moving back into the kind of trading environment that characterised the early years of this decade with sharp pikes higher in volatility and increasing downward pressure on GBP. The most obvious cause for this would appear to be the differing outlooks for monetary policy in the eurozone and the UK.From Europe the message continues to that in the short term the ECB will do what it can to provide liquidity to the market. However, as was made very clear last week, in the longer run the central bank continues to believe that policy remains accommodative. As a result the futures markets are implying that by the summer of next year the ECB’s official rate will still stand at least at 4 per cent (with the small possibility that it may have been hiked by then).In contrast, events in the UK over the past four days have seen investors becoming ever more pessimistic about the outlook for the housing market, the economy as a whole and monetary policy. As a result the futures markets are forecasting at least one rate cut by the BOE by the summer of next year. As for the timing of such a move, it seems that expectations on the timing of any move are being brought forward very quickly. This expectation is also built into the two-year interest rate spread between GBP and the EUR which continues to narrow at a rapid rate (from 113bp last Thursday to 91 bp today).The net result of all this has been that EUR/GBP has not only now broken out of the narrowing range that had defined trading since 2003 but is also accelerating rapidly. Indeed, last week’s move was the largest weekly rally since November of 2005. I think this is just the start.………………………………………………………………………………………………………The latest economic data suggests that a Japanese interest rates hike is not in the horizon. Persistent inflationary pressures will prevent the NZ central bank from cutting the official rate well into 2008. Why do you think carry trades have been cut so dramatically and what is the link between a credit crunch and a lighter appetite for carry trades?
Marco Nordio, Sao Paulo, BrasilSimon Derrick: I would agree that there seems little chance of a move by the BOJ at any time soon. Equally, rates are likely to remain high for some time to come. Why then should carry trades have unwound so violently?I think that the simple answer comes down to the fact that institutional investors (particularly the more leveraged players) are running more than one type of risk at any one time. The carry trade was, after all, being used for exactly the same reasons that investors were showing an increased interest in different debt instruments: to obtain a higher yield.An investor that may have taken a sharp hit in an illiquid instrument in one part of his portfolio may therefore find himself needing to reduce risk elsewhere. It is also important to remember that investors didn’t need to limit there use of the yen as a funding currency to simply buying higher yielding currencies. It is perfectly possible that it could have been used to fund investments in more exotic instruments. Much as in past events of this kind (the third quarter of 1998 most obviously) the key message that comes back is that all too often seemingly unconnected trading strategies have an undisclosed link. The answer usually comes down to who was doing the investing.………………………………………………………………………………………………………While the Fed fund’s futures are now implying three full cuts by the end of the year, what would be the price target for the dollar against euro and yen? Will there be significant downside in the exchange rate considering expected decline in interest rate and US paper demand.
Aman Jain, IndiaSimon Derrick: The interesting thing about this quite how much monetary easing is already being factored in by the financial markets. With a 60 per cent-ish chance being given for a 50 basis point cut by the FOMC tomorrow, and more down the line, it seems to me that there is substantial risk for disappointment.Interestingly, this was roughly how things played out in 1998 as well. After Alan Greenspan signalled a rate cut in early September of that year, equity markets recovered. However, when the FOMC only cut by 25bp the impact was like a bucket of cold water for investor sentiment. The final blow-out came in early October with a catastrophic collapse in dollar/yen. Subsequent to this, the Fed made an intra-meeting cut of a further 25 bp and then cut again in November. However, what was interesting to note was that the early October peak of the crisis also marked the point that the dollar finally began to recover against currencies such as the pound. Indeed, over the next nine months it managed to fall by 11 per cent against the dollar in pretty much a straight line.In other words, if we are, to an extent, echoing the events of 1998, then I’m not convinced that this is totally a dollar negative.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Should one be buying dollars or do you feel the US currency will still weaken? If so how much more do you think it will weaken against the major currencies?
Yasmin Adamali, KenyaSimon Derrick: I remain ambivalent about the USD. I certainly do believe that the USD will come under renewed pressure against the yen in the coming year. Our official forecasts for dollar/yen twelve months out are for it to hit Y108 at least. However, I also believe that a number of other currencies may actually be even more overvalued than the dollar.Most importantly, I think that sterling looks increasingly exposed to a sharp pullback. With the likelihood growing that we will see rate cuts in the UK next year, a decline in support from carry trade activity anyway and a history of precipitous declines from the $2.00 area, I can easily imagine sterling falling hard against a wide range of currencies.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Is there still mileage in carry trades and shorting the yen in particular
Mio Sylvester, LondonSimon Derrick: It is true that some of the yield pick ups available are still very attractive. However, for a trade like this to work you need a funding currency (i.e. the yen) that is stable to depreciating and a low volatility environment.Trends such as this tend to be self reinforcing. When the yen was weakening through the second quarter of this year, every temporary rally that emerged saw fresh sellers emerging which, in turn, dampened the volatility even further. Unfortunately, the opposite is likely to remain the case for some while yet.Although there was clearly a substantial clear out of positions in August, there remains the risk that some less leveraged players may still have short yen positions that they wish to close out. Remember that the BIS estimated that there were over $1000bn worth of yen loans outstanding during the first quarter of this year.Most importantly though, I think the real question here is whether the current period of heightened risk aversion is close to over. The most likely answer to that is no.………………………………………………………………………………………………………If you were personally sitting on an excess of USD and believed that the liquidity and credit crunch issues were to prevail for some time, the stock markets will take another hit and stay down for several years, the US will fall into recession and the carry trade will further unwind - in which currencies would you build positions to protect purchasing power? Would you include the Yuan as an option with good appreciating prospects against USD, euro and GBP and if so what is the best way to gain exposure? Do you view gold as a global currency?
Mike SSimon Derrick: Let me first say that I broadly agree with your assessment of the risks ahead. The question is therefore what to hold in the circumstances. If we assume that the speculative froth is now being knocked off the currency markets and that what, for want of a better term, the fundamentals will prevail for several years then what currencies will outperform?Putting aside previous yield driven favourites such as GBP or NZD or currencies such as the EUR that have benefited over the past five years from FX reserve diversification, I think there is only one obvious choice and that is to buy into Asian currencies. It is here that the frequently talked about ”global imbalances” really exist. If the yen stops serving as a funding currency for carry trades (which seems likely given recent events) then it is likely to start being driven by the more fundamental issues of trade. There are very good reasons why Mr Trichet keeps pointedly highlighting the performance of Asian currencies.Would I buy gold? Until the recently the answer would have been no. However, now that it is reverting to its more traditional role as a safe-haven in times of trouble then the answer would be yes.………………………………………………………………………………………………………What is your forecast for the euro/dollar in the next three months?
Can the euro overshoot 1.40? Don’t you think that a rate cut by the Fed will improve the US economy and the dollar, while a strong euro will harm European economy?
Paul Khouri, Beirut, LebanonSimon Derrick: My forecast is, if anything, for the euro/dollar to go nowhere fast. On the one hand we have the ECB’s commendable insistence upon remaining focused upon the inflation threat. However, I suspect that a number of factors will offset this.Firstly, although President Sarkozy remains somewhat out of favour at present, I can’t help feeling that he might suddenly find some political support for his views should the $1.40 level be breached, It is already noticeable that at least one employer’s body is complaining about the single currencies current strength.Secondly, I also suspect that the process of FX reserve diversification that has driven the euro to its current levels may slow down as hot money flows into some emerging markets subside. Although it might mean nothing, I also note that some European government bond spreads have been widening out of late. Could this be another sign that official investors are becoming more cautious about the single currency?………………………………………………………………………………………………………What would be the most intelligent way for an individual investor to profit from the currency markets?
Michael Jenkins, Phoenix, AZSimon Derrick: The first thing to do would be to have an appropriate understanding of the risks involved. One of the most unnerving aspects of the currency markets until recently was the rise in popularity of the carry trade not just in the professional market but also amongst private investors. As I noted below, this is, by definition, a high risk trade given how volatile the currency markets can prove to be. I was therefore surprised to see articles being written during the summer (not in the FT I hasten to add) telling private investors how the trade worked and how to get involved. Subsequent events proved how dangerous a trade this can be.The second thing to realise is that there is no failsafe way of consistently forecasting how currencies will perform that I am aware of. If there were then I would have retired a long time ago. However, this is not to say that there aren’t consistent approaches that you can take to capture trends when they emerge. There is plenty of literature out there on the use of technical rules to get you into and out of trends.Thirdly, as long as you leave the appropriate stop losses, try not to screen watch. Set your targets, stick by your rules and try not to get caught up in the minute by minute fluctuations in a currencies fortunes.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Why is the New Zealand dollar lagging so far behind other currencies? Will it catch up with other foreign currencies like the Australian dollar on the back of resumption of the carry trade due to a weaker yen and weaker US dollar?
Paul Lee, Hong KongSimon Derrick: The New Zealand dollar really has had an appalling time of late, losing just under a quarter of its value against the Japanese currency in the space of just 18 trading days in July and August. However, its also worth remembering that these losses came at the end of an equally remarkable rally that had seen the Kiwi effectively double in value over a seven year period and had prompted the RBNZ to take the controversial decision to intervene in the markets during the summer. Even after the declines the currency is still trading around the kinds of levels seen in the first quarter of this year.All of this goes to reflect two basic points. The first is that the New Zealand dollar was one of the most popular target currencies for the carry trade on the back of its huge interest rate differential over the Yen. The second point is that, relative to say sterling, the Kiwi can be a little more illiquid at times. The combination of these two factors goes a long way towards explaining both the extent of the rally and the subsequent severity of the declines.Will the New Zealand dollar regain its favoured currency status in the near future? For choice I would have to say no. Although the yield differential still looks compelling, the markets have had a forceful reminder that the carry trade is a high risk proposition. With no sign of any imminent easing of tensions in financial markets generally, I suspect that investors will steer clear of this kind of trade for some while yet.………………………………………………………………………………………………………Some people are making projections that the US will fall into a recession, or at least find itself not being spend as much due to a de-leveraging effect the credit turmoil may have on US consumer spending. Because of this, are you bullish on the Yen and expecting the carry to unwind?
Tariq Ali, TexasSimon Derrick: Given that the carry trade has been one of the defining trades for the currency markets in the past few years, this is possibly the key question at present. As the carry trade is, inherently, a high risk strategy, one of the basic conditions needed to make it work is that the markets need to be calm if investors are to feel comfortable chasing yield differentials.A 610 basis point interest rate pick up for holding the Australian dollar and borrowing in yen for twelve months looks considerably less attractive when it is remembered that the Australian unit lost substantially more than this on just one day alone last month. When confidence in this type of trade is lost, it typically takes a number of years to recover. After the collapse of a very similar trend in October 1998 it took over two years for a sustained recovery to emerge.Given that we are currently in the process of winding up a currency market bubble of substantially greater magnitude than that seen in 1998, it seems reasonable to suppose that the yen still has some way to appreciate.………………………………………………………………………………………………………What’s your view on euro replacing the dollar as the reserve currency? What events would trigger this move?
Chiunta Chen, LondonSimon Derrick: This remains a hot topic of conversation in the markets with even Mr Greenspan commenting that its ”absolutely conceivable that the EUR will replace the USD as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency.”The key point here is that the euro already represents a substantial proportion of FX reserves globally. Although no exact numbers exist, it is generally assumed that the euro comprises a little over a quarter of official holdings. However, what is also interesting to note is that there has been little sign of this ratio changing dramatically in recent years.In other words, although there is plenty of evidence to suggest that substantial amounts of euros have been purchased by reserve managers, it seems likely that this was done to diversify the fresh reserves being accumulated rather than anything else.Can I imagine some of the “smaller” players deciding to diversify more actively into the EUR? Given the headlines over the past twelve months the answer is yes. Can I imagine the largest players (China most obviously) doing the same thing? No. Given the sheer scale of their FX reserves ($ 1.33 trillion and counting) even the slightest hint that they were to start selling some of their existing holdings of dollars for the euro would cause self defeating market turbulence and a potential political storm. Its also hard to imagine in the short term at least, reserve managers being prepared to start aggressively diversifying into the euro when the greenback is already trading close to an all time low.Could the euro ultimately take on equal status to the dollar? Yes, it is possible but I suspect that it may take a long time to get there.………………………………………………………………………………………………………"
760;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-09-13T15:29:01Z;House price slowdown hits sterling;;The pound hit 13-month low against the euro on Thursday as weak house price data sparked fears that sterling might be on the verge of a sharper downturn against the single currency.The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors house price balance slumped sharply in the three months to August, from a downwardly revised July reading of 10.8 per cent to -1.8 per cent, its lowest reading since October 2005.Analysts said the data underlined the recent divergence in interest rate expectations between the UK and the eurozone, with markets increasingly expecting the next UK move to be down, while the European Central Bank may still lift interest rates again.Greg Gibbs at ABN Amro said arguably the UK property market was the next most vulnerable after the US since it had been pushed higher in recent years by speculative investors.He said recent turbulence on the financial markets had contributed to tougher borrowing conditions and higher interest rates, especially at the lower quality end of the UK’s lending market.“The longer credit market turmoil persists, the more the market will view currencies with housing market excesses with suspicion,” said Mr Gibbs. “The UK and the pound may be seen as the next cab off the rank.”The pound fell to £0.6874 against the euro, its lowest level since July 2006.Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said what was interesting about the move was that it has finally taken the currencies out of the narrowing range within which they have traded against each other since 2003.“Given this we are starting to wonder whether the current move could prove to be the start of a more sustained in the pattern of trading in euro/sterling back to the kind of environment that characterised the early years of this decade: sharply higher volatility and increasing downward pressure on the pound,” he said.
761;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-09-07T17:35:23Z;Dollar close to low against euro;;The dollar fell to within 1 cent of its record low versus the euro this week as data revealed that the US economy shed jobs for the first time since August 2003.US non-farm payroll figures released Friday showed 4,000 jobs were lost in August, well below expectations for an increase of 112,000.Analysts said the number increased expectations that the Federal Reserve would move to cut its lending rate.“This is unequivocally bad news for the dollar, raising the probability that the Fed will cut interest rates on or before its next meeting on September 18 to almost 100 per cent,” said Michael Woolfolk, at Bank of New York Mellon.“This is the first piece of solid data that shows the problems in the US mortgage markets are hitting the real economy.”The dollar fell 1 per cent to $1.3770 against the euro over the week, close to its record low of $1.3852 touched on July 24. The dollar also fell 1.9 per cent to Y113.60 against the yen, 0.5 per cent to $2.0270 against the pound and 1.6 per cent to SFr1.1890 against the Swiss franc.The jobs data added to the bearish sentiment on the dollar that manifested itself during in the week after a plunge in US home sales was reported on Wednesday.Analysts said it was the first time in the recent bout of market turbulence that soft US data was seen as dollar negative, instead of positive as US investors repatriated money from other riskier assets.The yen benefited and higher-yielding currencies suffered as risk aversion increased.The yen, which has been widely used for funding carry trades, in which low-yielding currencies are sold to finance the purchase of riskier assets elsewhere, rose 0.9 per cent to Y156.45 against the euro on the week. It climbed 1.4 per cent to Y230.15 against the pound and jumped 3.4 per cent to Y78.40 against the New Zealand dollar.The euro was supported as the European Central Bank maintained its hawkish bias on interest rates. The ECB kept interest rates on hold at 4 per cent on Thursday, blaming the turbulence on financial markets, but said it still saw upside risks to inflation.Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, continued to call monetary policy accommodative and referred to vigorous monetary and credit growth in the eurozone.“This all sounds like an intention to raise rates as soon as markets allow it,” said Erik Nielsen, at Goldman Sachs.The euro rose 0.5 per cent to £0.6795 against the pound on the week.Sterling lost ground after comments from the Bank of England as it left interest rates on hold at 5.75 per cent on Thursday.Like the ECB, the central bank blamed market conditions, saying it was too soon to tell how the turmoil would affect its inflation target.Unusually for a “no-change” decision, the bank’s monetary policy committee released a statement explaining its lack of action, which Daragh Maher, at Calyon, took to be a dovish sign.“The very fact that the MPC chose to issue a statement even though it left rates unchanged is a tacit acknowledgement that these are extraordinary times, which in turn rather argues against any near-term threat of a hike,” he said.The Swedish central bank, however, decided to raise interest rates.The Swedish krona rose 0.5 per cent to SKr9.3500 against the euro and 1.5 per cent to SKr6.7860 against the dollar on the week as the Riksbank raised rates 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent.
762;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Global Overview: Money market conditions still tight;;"Forthcoming data releases and central bank meetings provided the main focus on Monday as the closure of US markets for the Labor Day holiday meant trading activity was subdued.European and Asian equities put in mixed performances, while the yen lost ground against most major currencies – most notably the high-yielding Australian dollar.Oil prices pushed higher amid concerns about potential hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico.Money market conditions stayed extremely tight as banks remained reluctant to lend to each other given current credit concerns.The three-month sterling London interbank-offered rate rose to a fresh 8½-year high of 6.74 per cent.“With the turmoil that has wreaked havoc across financial markets moving on, the assessment of damage can now proceed,” said Neil Mellor, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.“Pressure upon the Federal Reserve to act will certainly grow if economic data unveil any notable weakening in activity; and as such, this week’s US data release schedule, although fairly limited, is likely to be the most important for some time.“Hence, today’s [Monday’s] August Institute of Supply Management manufacturing data will be key in setting the mood across markets until the all-important August non-farm payrolls report on Friday,” Mr Mellor said.Meanwhile, most analysts believe that both the European Central Bank will hold interest rates steady this week given the recent market turmoil and widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed funds rate soon.In addition, the eurozone purchasing managers’ index confirmed a modest slowdown in manufacturing last month – which some analysts said would strengthen the case for leaving rates unchanged.Analysts also believe the Bank of England will leave rates on hold, despite the release on Monday of the strongest UK manufacturing data for three years.But Julian Jessop at Capital Economics noted that history provided several examples where official rates have headed in opposite directions at much the same time.“If the Fed succeeds in calming the markets and in cushioning the US from the housing slump, [central] banks elsewhere will feel under less pressure to change tack,” he said.“Recent economic data suggest that there is still a good case for one more rate hike in the UK and the eurozone – business confidence remains at relatively high levels and the financial market turmoil has had little impact on consumer confidence.”Equity markets lacked a clear trend in the absence of any lead from Wall Street.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.3 per cent as gains in the banking sector offset weaker utility stocks.Gaz de France and Suez both eased back on profit-taking as the two companies agreed the terms of their long-awaited merger.However, Sweden’s Svenska Handesbanken jumped 7.8 per cent after it sold its life insurance arm to Storebrand for $2.6bn.It was a mixed picture in Asia. The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index both slipped 0.3 per cent, although South Korean stocks rose 0.5 per cent to a three-week high.Chinese equities continued their inexorable march forward, with the Shanghai composite index gaining 2 per cent to hit a fresh record high.European government bonds edged back as the firmer tone in the equity market prompted a halt to “safe haven” buying. The yield on the 10-year German Bund rose 2 basis points to 4.27 per cent while the two-year Schatz yield rose 1bp to 4.05 per cent.On the currency markets, the yen dropped 0.6 per cent against the Australian dollar and slipped against sterling as soothing comments last week from President George W. Bush and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke gave a modest boost to risk appetite.In commodities, oil prices moved higher as investors kept a close watch on Hurricane Felix, even though the latest projections indicate it will avoid offshore US oil and gas installations. October West Texas Intermediate, traded electronically, held above $74 a barrel.Gold drifted back from Friday’s three-week high, while base metals largely held steady in quiet trade."
763;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-08-24T16:37:57Z;Global overview: Fed helps restore calm;;Calmer conditions returned to financial markets this week as the prospect of further action by the Federal Reserve alleviated the worst of the recent anxiety.News of a huge investment by Bank of America in ailing US mortgage lender Countrywide Financial and further evidence of the willingness of central banks to inject funds into the financial system further bolstered sentiment.“The turnaround in market sentiment since the Fed’s discount rate cut on 17th August and the additional injections of liquidity from the European Central Bank have taken major equity indices back to levels which are only a little lower than they were at the start of the month,” noted Julian Jessop at Capital Economics. “Meltdown has been avoided.”But the underlying picture remained one of uncertainty as money market conditions remained extremely tight and investors began to ponder the likely impact of the turmoil on the wider economy.“With risk appetite largely held up by great expectations of the Fed, a nervous wait has perhaps inevitably bred a modicum of doubt,” said Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon.“Money markets remain in a state of deadlock, with available funds only changing hands at a premium despite the concerted efforts of central banks – not because of a lack of funds, but because of the uncertain state of security valuation,” he added.The early part of the week was marked by a dramatic surge in short-dated US Treasury bills - regarded as extremely low-risk, liquid investments. The yield on the three-month bill plunged as much as 125 basis points to 2.5 per cent on Monday - the biggest one-day drop since the stock market crash of October 1987. But prices steadily retreated over subsequent days and the yield was back above 4 per cent by midday yesterday.Longer-dated government bonds retreated as confidence returned to equity markets. The yield on the two-year US Treasury rose 11bp over the week to 4.28 per cent while in Europe, the two-year Schatz yield rose 6bp to 4.02 per cent. The 10-year Bund yield fell 4bp to 4.26 per centFurther signs that investors were growing less averse to risk came from increased demand for emerging market assets.The MSCI Emerging Market equity index bounced more than 8 per cent from the low struck on Thursday August 16. The yield spread on emerging market sovereign bonds narrowed sharply after hitting its widest point since November 2005, and most EM currencies held up well before running into profit-taking at the end of week.Returning risk appetite was also evident in the foreign exchange markets as investors increased their exposure to the carry trade - where low-yielding currencies such as the yen fund purchases of higher-yielding assets.The yen fell 1.6 per cent against the US dollar over the week, and suffered even bigger losses against high-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars.Also weighing on the yen was the Bank of Japan’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. However, analysts said a tightening remained likely in September or October assuming that market conditions stabilised.Global equity markets had a very strong week, with the MSCI All-World index rising more than 3 per cent.A powerful rally for Asian stocks led the way as the MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index rebounded 13 per cent from a five-month low struck last week. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 climbed 6.4 per cent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped more than 12 per cent - its best weekly gain for nearly seven years - following news that Chinese investors would be allowed to invest directly in shares listed in the city. In Shanghai itself, the composite index surged to a record high above the psychological 5,000 level.Gains in the US and Europe were comparatively muted, with the S&P 500 index rising 1.2 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 adding 2.8 per cent.In commodities, base metals recovered as fears about the impact of a credit crunch on the global economy receded. But oil prices eased back amid fading concerns about hurricane damage to Gulf of Mexico oil installations.
764;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-08-21T21:13:39Z;Global overview: Markets remain volatile;;Financial markets remained volatile on Tuesday as continuing credit concerns snuffed out a strong early rally for short-dated US Treasury bills.Wall Street stocks recovered from earlier lows to end mixed after hopes of a cut in US interest rates were spurred by comments from Christopher Dodd, the US senate banking committee chairman.The overriding mood in the global markets remained cautious however as continued fears about a global credit crunch fuelled risk aversion and continued to drive a flight towards safer assets. “Volatility continues to plague financial markets as investors remain torn between a ‘requisite’ flight from risk and hopes over a near-term easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve,” said Neil Mellor, strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.“Given that interest rate futures and financial markets in general have taken the Federal Open Market Committee’s statement on Friday as firm evidence of the Committee’s intent to cut rates in mid-September, then it is clear that current asset price levels are now hostage to their monetary policy ‘premium’,” he added.Mr Dodd said that Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, had indicted he would use all available tools to calm market turmoil.Interest rate futures had already fully priced in a cut in the Fed funds target rate by the US central bank’s next policy meeting in September.Nick Kounis, senior economist at Fortis Bank, said he thought it “very likely” that the Fed would decide to cut the funds rate twice during the coming three months, with a distinct possibility of an easing before next month’s meeting.But Mr Kounis added that he remained positive about the outlook for the US economy.“Downward revisions to our growth forecasts will be very limited in size and we are likely to shave no more than one or two-tenths from growth in 2007 and 2008,” he said. “This leads us to think that the Fed will be forced to turn on its heels relatively soon after order has been restored to financial markets, and start hiking again from the middle of next year onwards.”The reversal of fortune in the short-dated US government bond market saw the yield on the one-month Treasury bill swing higher, rising by 89 basis points on the day to 3 per cent. The three-month bill yield was 43bp higher on the day at 3.61 per cent. But there was solid demand further along the curve as the yield on the two-year note briefly dipped to 3.96 per cent, the lowest since September 2005, before recovering to stand lower at 4.02 per cent. The 10-year yield fell 4bp to 4.6 per cent.In the currency markets, expectations of lower US rates undermined the dollar, sending the US currency back towards Y114. The yen further benefited from the latest bout of investor risk aversion.Global equity markets put in mixed performances.By the close of trade in New York, the S&P 500 index was up 0.1 per cent, the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower.But the rally came too late to help European stocks, and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended flat at 1,482.29.Asian equities largely built on Monday’s powerful rallies. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 1.1 per cent, Sydney gained 1 per cent and Seoul added 0.3 per cent.News that China would allow its citizens to invest directly in Hong Kong shares sent the Hang Seng index up as much as 4.7 per cent, although the benchmark drifted back to finish just 0.6 per cent higher.In Shanghai itself, the composite index rose 1 per cent to a fresh record close. A decision by the People’s Bank of China to raise its deposit and lending rates, in a bid to stabilise inflation expectations, was announced after the market’s close.Lena Komileva, economist at Tullett Prebon, said the tightening moves “confirm once again that Chinese policy is driven by domestic political priorities rather than consideration of international interests”.In commodities, oil prices continued to slide as hurricane Dean showed signs of losing strength, easing concerns about possible damage to installations in the Gulf of Mexico. September West Texas Intermediate fell $1.65 to trade below the $70 a barrel level for the first time since early July.
765;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-08-17T17:43:03Z;Yen stages spectacular rally;;The yen staged a spectacular rally and high-yielding currencies tumbled this week as signs emerged that carry trades were imploding.Analysts said rising risk aversion amid sharp falls on global equity markets had triggered mass liquidation of carry trade positions in which the low-yielding Japanese unit is sold to fund the the purchase of riskier, higher-yielding assets elsewhere.“The era of the carry trade is no more,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. “Appropriate conditions for its return are unlikely to be forthcoming for some time to come. As the dismantling of the trade proceeds, upward pressure on the yen is likely to persist.”The yen climbed to a 14-month high of Y111.62 against the dollar in volatile trading Friday. It later fell back to Y113.65 but was still up a striking 4 per cent on the week.This marked the yen’s biggest weekly gain against the dollar since 1998, when yen-funded carry trades were liquidated in the wake of the near collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund.Derek Halpenny at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ said it was now a realistic proposition for the dollar to fall below the 2006 low of Y109.“In such an environment the yen remains the best safe-haven currency, and with additional [short positions on the yen] still remaining, continued global market uncertainty may well result in dollar/yen returning to the Y105.00-Y110.00 range.”Analysts said the Australian dollar was not helped by the Reserve Bank of Australia admitting Friday that it had intervened to buy the currency in what it described as “rather thin, disorderly FX markets”.Adam Cole, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: “The move was widely interpreted as merely smoothing out intra-day volatility.”Indeed, higher-yielding currencies were hit hard, with the Australian and New Zealand dollars falling 10.3 per cent to Y89.62 and 11.5 per cent to Y78.18 against the yen respectively on the week.The pound, meanwhile, fell 5.8 per cent to Y224.60 against the yen over the week.The yen also advanced against the euro, breaching the Y150 mark for the first time this year as it peaked at Y149.28 Friday. The euro later made up some ground to stand at Y153.50, still down 5.3 per cent on the week.The low-yielding Swiss franc, which has also been a favourite funding currency among carry trade investors, also advanced. It rose 1 per cent to SFr1.6245 against the euro and 1.6 per cent to SFr2.3876 against the pound over the week.However, the Swiss franc lost 0.8 to SFr1.2064 against the dollar on the week, despite a move Friday from the Federal Reserve to lower the discount rate by 50 basis points to 5.75 per cent.The dollar rose 1.4 per cent to $1.3500 against the euro and 1.9 per cent to $1.9857 against the pound over the week as investors rushed to the safe haven of the US Treasury market.Meanwhile, the dollar jumped 6.8 per cent to $0.8765 against the Australian dollar and 8.3 per cent to $0.6840 against the New Zealand dollar over the week.Emerging markets currencies took a hit as nervousness spread across the globe. The Brazilian real dropped 4.6 per cent to R$2.0400 against the dollar on the week, while the South African rand fell 3.6 per cent to R7.4160 and the Indonesian rupiah lost 1.3 per cent to Rp9,470.
766;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-08-16T21:40:54Z;Emerging market currencies plunge on risk aversion;;The currencies of emerging economies fell sharply on Thursday as the continued turbulence across global markets saw investors escalate the liquidation of riskier assets.The South Korean won was among the biggest casualties as local stocks plummeted. It fell 1.5 per cent to a three-month low of Won946.10 against the dollar, its largest daily decline since the North Korean missile test in October 2006.Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, expected sharper falls to follow as more foreign investors liquidate their equity positions in emerging markets.On Thursday, Asia-Pacific shares posted some of their worst intra-day falls this year on a sharp rise in risk aversion.“If panic really starts to set in and they pull the plug, we could see emerging market currencies seriously start to slide,” he said.Other high-yielding Asian currencies were also hit, with the Philippine peso, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee all losing nearly 1 per cent against the dollar. Central banks in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia were all believed to have intervened in the market by selling dollars to stem the decline in their currencies.Emerging markets outside of Asia were also hit, with the Turkish lira tumbling 4.9 per cent to TL1.4000 against the dollar and the Brazilian real dropping 3.4 per cent to R$2.0980.Dominic Wilson, senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, said the falls were striking given the fact that one of the more notable features of the recent market sell-off had been that emerging market currencies were proving to be relatively resilient, protected by forecast of strong growth in local economies.He said emerging market high-yielding currencies had in general held up well relative to the much greater pressure on major high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar.The kiwi has fallen more than 14 per cent against the yen in the past three weeks because of a sharp unwinding of the carry trade, where funds are borrowed in currencies of countries with low interest rates to invest in higher yielding assets elsewhere.
767;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-08-15T01:23:26Z;US banks create trading system;;A group of Wall Street’s largest banks have joined forces to create a new market for private placements, adding to already intense competition to establish the industry standard trading platform for unregistered US securities.The new system, known as the Open Platform for Unregistered Securities (Opus-5), is backed by Citigroup, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and The Bank of New York Mellon.It is designed to enable an open market with multiple market makers and is designed to provide broad liquidity to the US private placement market and give greater access to capital for issuers in the private placement or 144A market.Competition in the area was heightened further on Tuesday when Bear Stearns unveiled its own platform for private placements, known as Best Markets.Other banks, including JP Morgan, with its 144A Plus platform, and Goldman Sachs through its GSTrUE system have already established a presence in the private placement market.Companies, particularly from outside the US, view private placements as a way to avoid burdensome US regulation and gain quick, cheap access to US capital markets without the need to register securities with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Some see such placements as a first step towards a public flotation. Others, particularly international companies and alternative investment outfits, see them as the best way to raise capital in the US.Companies in the US raised more money through deals involving private placements than initial public offerings last year, demonstrating how issuers are shying away from the scrutiny and expense of the US public market.
768;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-08-09T21:35:13Z;WestLB admits to credit exposure;;WestLB, the publicly-owned Landesbank, became the latest German bank to admit to exposure to the US subprime mortgage market, although it denied it was facing a liquidity problem.The bank, which this week froze a fund managed by its joint venture with the Bank of New York Mellon, said it was exposed to structured credit instruments, but that “there is no liquidity crisis”.The statement came as the German banking industry agreed to implement the bail-out of IKB, the troubled small company lender, which has been hit by the turmoil in credit markets.At a meeting at Germany’s Bundesbank on Thursday, the banks involved formally agreed to a rescue fund worth up to €3.5bn ($4.79bn) to cover losses at IKB. KfW, the state-owned bank that owns 38 per cent of IKB, will lead the group of banks.Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission said it would ask the German government for details about the rescue operation within the next 20 days, to see if it complied with EU rules on state aid.WestLB on Thursday res­ponded to speculation that its US asset management arm Brightwater Capital Management was facing liquidity problems related to the subprime mortgage crisis.The bank faced difficulties over other trading activities this year, which led to the dismissal of Thomas Fischer, chief executive.WestLB stressed that its situation did not “in any way compare” with that at IKB. It said nearly 93 per cent of the collateralised debt obligations it had in­vested in were rated between A or AAA, the top rating.Separately, another German fund said it had temporarily frozen its asset-backed fund. Sal Oppenheim, the German bank, on Monday closed a €750m asset-backed credit fund until further notice after investors had pulled out €100m from the fund.
769;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-07-31T16:36:02Z;London retains FX pre-eminence;;Growth in daily foreign exchange trading volumes in London was almost double that of New York in the six months to April according to figures released on Tuesday.Data from the Foreign Exchange Standing Committee showed average daily volumes surged by 27 per cent in London, with turnover in New York up by 15.8 per cent in the same period.The surge in volumes has been attributed to the continuing emergence of foreign exchange as an asset class in its own right and the expansion of electronic trading platforms.London has retained its pre-eminence in foreign exchange trading, with daily volumes of $1.206bn in April. This compared with daily volumes of $618bn in New York, the world’s second largest FX trading centre.Analysts said they believed London has benefited from a rising tide of petrodollars and flows from global foreign exchange reserve managers who need to diversify their massive dollar stockpiles away from the US currency.Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon, said the pace of FX reserve accumulation by global reserve managers over the past six months had been astonishing.“A good number of those reserve managers are based in the Middle East and Asia,” he said. “It is to be expected that they would be doing their dealing through London.”
770;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2007-02-05T16:30:38Z;State Street to buy IFS for $4.5bn;;"State Street, the world’s largest mutual fund servicing business, said on Monday it would acquire Investors Financial Services for about $4.5bn in stock.Ronald Logue, State Street’s chairman and chief executive, said the two Boston-based companies ""already share a similar focus, service model and customer type, which makes for a seamless and swift consolidation.""State Street said the deal – which is supposed to close by the third quarter - would cut into earnings this year, but would begin adding to the bottom line in 2009. The company sees cost savings of about $345m to $365m in the first two years after the acquisition closes amid staffing, technology, and property consolidation.State Street said it expected pretax restructuring charges of $625m to $675m.Analysts praised the deal as “strategically sound” but said that the terms appear expensive. Andrew Marquardt, analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, said in a research report that: “there appears to be meaningful overlap and economies of scale opportunities, but the pricing looks expensive at first glance”.Once the deal has closed, the State Street will have more than $14,000bn in assets under custody, including $3,500bn in mutual fund assets under administration.The acquisition comes on the heels of a merger announced between rivals Mellon Financial and Bank of New York. The new company, to be known as Bank of New York Mellon, will have more than $16,600bn of assets under custody.Earlier this year, State Street said it would buy Currenex for $564m to add electronic foreign exchange trading services.Shareholders of Investors Financial, a provider of accounting, back-office and investment-advisory services to asset managers, will receive 0.906 State Street shares for each share of Investors Financial. The deal values the Boston-based company at $65.01 a share, a 38 per cent premium to Friday's closing price of $46.95.In morning trade, shares of State Street were down 5.6% at $67.74, while IFS jumped 28.6 per cent to $60.50."
771;BK;Bank of New York Mellon Corp;2006-12-04T19:55:55Z;This diamond’s her best, best friend;;"Asprey’s 225th anniversary party on Thursday at its Bond Street store has always promised to be a glittering affair, with guests including Tim Jeffries, Nigel Havers, David Furnish, David Tang and Tom Parker Bowles.All will be outshone, however, by one celebrity who is yet to be named.She will be wearing a 22.93 carat diamond, valued by Asprey at more than $100m (£50m), on loan from a private collector. The “vivid blue” stone can be seen at the store by appointment only.Asprey will also unveil a new purple-and-gold coat of arms (above, right). It features Asprey-cut diamonds and crowns surmounted by a phoenix.Going for a songIts official name may be Bank of New York Mellon Corp, but the entity to be created by a US bank merger has already been christened “Bony M”.Just in time for a rousing Christmas party medley of Daddy Cool, Rasputin, Rivers of Babylon and Brown Girl in the Ring.Musically and otherwise, though, it could be worse; the other way around, it would be called “Mel B”.In father’s footstepsJames Murdoch’s claim that BSkyB’s recent purchase of the 17.9 per cent stake in ITV was his own idea can only make one wonder about how much he takes after his father.Buying stakes in rival media groups to be at the centre of corporate activity is, of course, a favourite tactic of Rupert Murdoch.There was also the younger Murdoch’s speech last week at an Ofcom conference, in which he lambasted elitism in UK broadcast media.According to Michael Grade’s autobiography, Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s “opined that British television was dominated by a bunch of elitists who think they know what’s good for viewers”.James Murdoch, by the way, is currently reading The Greek Myths by Robert Graves. Has he reached the bit about Oedipus yet?Loewy’s fresh sliceOn the same day that RHM, the food group better known as Rank Hovis-
McDougall, officially agreed to a £1.2bn takeover bid from Premier Foods, the company that once rebranded Hovis also went under the hammer.Williams Murray Hamm, the branding and design agency that devised the wheeze of putting images of baked beans and cucumbers on Hovis bread packaging, has been bought by Loewy, a privately owned marketing group, for £7m.The three founders – Richard Williams, Richard Murray and Garrick Hamm – will get two-thirds of their payment in cash and the rest in shares under a three-year earn-out. It is the third deal by Loewy, which is chaired by Luke Johnson, in the last month, after its purchases of the branding agency Bite and Rainier PR.First impressionsEven in the best-run businesses, things break and must be taken out of service. But you expect them to be promptly fixed, especially at a flagship operation such as BAA’s Heathrow airport.The “jetway” at Gate 16 of Terminal One was out of service on Thursday and still broken yesterday morning. Updates will be welcomed from passengers and staff of Bmi, whose ill luck it is to use that gate.Sharing a dugoutAren’t there enough financial PRs to go around? Brunswick has popped up advising both Dubai Investment Corporation and Liverpool Football Club on the former’s possible investment in the latter.Apparently, Dubai is the real client, and Brunswick was only lending a helping hand to Liverpool, which has not awarded it a formal mandate. In PR speak, such arrangements are not called conflicts but “adjacencies”.mudlark@ft.com"
